The Tribunal dismissed\nthe appeals holding that its jurisdiction was restricted by\nthe limits imposed by the parent Statute, i.e., the\nElectricity Act, 2003. The Tribunal held that the\nappropriate course of action for the appellants was to\nproceed by way of judicial review under the Constitution\nof India. Hence the present appeals.\nThe questions for consideration before the Court\nwere: (i) Whether the Appellate Tribunal constituted\nunder the 2003 Act has jurisdiction u/s. 111 of the Act, to\nexamine the validity of the 2006 Regulations (ii) Whether\nF capping of trading margins could be done by the Central\nElectricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) by making a\nRegulation in that regard u/s. 178 of 2003 Act and (iii)\nWhether Parliament has conferred power of judicial\nreview on the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity u/s. 121 of\nG the 2003 Act.\nH\nDismissing the appeals, the Court\nHELD: 1.1. A regulation u/s. 178 is made under the\nauthority of delegated legislation and consequently its\nPTC INDIA LTD. v. CENTRAL ELECTRICITY\nREGULATORY COMM. THR. SECRY.\n611\nvalidity can be tested only in judicial review proceedings A\nbefore the courts and not by way of appeal before the\nAppellate Tribunal for Electricity under Section 111 of\nElectricity Act, 2003. [Para 59] [684-H; 685-A]\n1.2. The decision-making and regulation-making\nfunctions are both assigned to CERC. Law comes into\nexistence not only through legislation but also by\nregulation and litigation. Laws from all three sources are\nbinding. A statutory instrument, such as a rule or\nregulation, emanates from the exercise of delegated\nlegislative power which is a part of administrative process\nresembling enactment of law by the legislature whereas\na quasi-judicial order comes from adjudication which is\nalso part of administrative process resembling a judicial\ndecision by a court of law. [Para 37] [664-H; 655-A-C]\nShri Sitaram Sugar Co. Ltd. v. Union of India and Ors.\n(1990) 3 SCC 223, referred to.\n1.3. Price fixation exercise is actually legislative in\ncharacter, unless by the terms of a particular statute it is\nmade quasi-judicial as in the case of Tariff fixation u/s. 62\nmade appealable u/s. 111 of the 2003 Act, though Section\n61 is an enabling provision for the framing of regulations\nby CERC. If one takes \"Tariff\" as a subject-matter, one\nfinds that under Part VII of the 2003 Act actual\ndetermination/ fixation of tariff is done by the appropriate\nCommission u/s. 62, whereas Section 61 is the enabling\nprovision for framing of regulations containing generic\npropositions in accordance with which the appropriate\nCommission has to fix the tariff. This basic scheme\nequally applies to subject-matter “trading margin” in a\ndifferent statutory context. [Para 38] [665-D-F]\nB\nC\nD\nLU\nE\nF\nG\n1.4. Section 79 delineates the functions of CERC\nbroadly into two categories - mandatory functions and\nadvisory functions. Tariff regulation, licensing (including H\nB\n612 SUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2010] 3 S.C.R.\nA inter-State trading licensing), adjudication upon disputes\ninvolving generating companies or transmission\nlicensees fall under the head \"mandatory functions\"\nwhereas advising Central Government on formulation of\nNational Electricity Policy and tariff policy would fall\nunder the head \"advisory functions\". In this sense, CERC\nis the decision-making authority. Such decision-making\nu/s. 79 (1) is not dependant upon making of regulations\nu/s. 178 by CERC. Therefore, functions of CERC\nenumerated in Section 79 are separate and distinct from\nC function of CERC u/s. 178. The former is administrative/\nadjudicatory function whereas the latter is legislative.\n[Para 39] [666-H; 667-A-C]\nD\nF\nM/s. Narinder Chand Hem Raj and Ors. v. Lt. Governor,\nAdministrator, Union Territory, Himachal Pradesh and Ors.\n(1971) 2 SCC 747; Indian Express Newspapers (Bombay)\nPvt. Ltd. and Ors. v. Union of India and Ors. (1985) 1 SCC\n641, relied on.\n1.5. On reading Sections 76(1) and 79(1) one finds\nE that CERC is empowered to take measures/steps in\ndischarge of the functions enumerated in Section 79(1)\nlike to regulate the tariff of generating companies, to\nregulate the inter-State transmission of electricity, to\ndetermine tariff for inter-State transmission of electricity,\nto issue licenses, to adjudicate upon disputes, to levy\nfees, to specify the Grid Code, to fix the trading margin\nin inter-State trading of electricity, if considered\nnecessary, etc.. These measures, which CERC is\nempowered to take, have got to be in conformity with the\nregulations u/s. 178, wherever such regulations are\napplicable. Measures u/s. 79(1), therefore, have got to be\nin conformity with the regulations u/s. 178. To regulate is\nan exercise which is different from making of the\nregulations. However, making of a regulation u/s. 178 is\nnot a pre-condition to the Central Commission taking any\nG\nH\nPTC INDIA LTD. v. CENTRAL ELECTRICITY\nREGULATORY COMM. THR. SECRY.\n613\nsteps/measures u/s. 79(1). If there is a regulation, then the A\nmeasure u/s. 79(1) has to be in conformity with such\nregulation u/s. 178. The dichotomy between the power to\nmake a regulation u/s. 178 on one hand and the various\nenumerated areas in Section 79(1) in which CERC is\nmandated to take such measures as it deems to fulfil the B\nobjects of 2003 Act. [Para 40] [667-F-H; 668-A-C]\n1.6. In the hierarchy of regulatory powers and\nfunctions under the 2003 Act, Section 178, which deals\nwith making of regulations by the Central Commission,\nunder the authority of subordinate legislation, is wider\nthan Section 79(1) of the 2003 Act, which enumerates the\nregulatory functions of the CERC, in specified areas, to\nbe discharged by orders (decisions). [Para 59] [684-E-F]\nC\n1.7. In the instant case, instead of fixing a trading D\nmargin (including capping) on a case to case basis,\nCERC thought it fit to make a regulation which has a\ngeneral application to the entire trading activity which has\nbeen recognized, for the first time, under 2003 Act.\nMaking of a regulation u/s. 178 became necessary E\nbecause a regulation made u/s. 178 has the effect of\ninterfering and overriding the existing contractual\nrelationship between the regulated entities. A regulation\nu/s. 178 is in the nature of a subordinate legislation. Such\nsubordinate legislation can even override the existing\ncontracts including Power Purchase Agreements which\nhave got to be aligned with the regulations u/s. 178 and\nwhich could not have been done across the board by an\norder of the CERC u/s. 79(1)(j). [Para 40] [669-B-E]\nF\nNational Hydro-electric Power Corporation Ltd. v. CIT G\n2010 (1) SCALE 5; M/s Southern Technologies Ltd. v. Joint\nCommissioner of Income Tax, Coimbatore 2010 (1) SCALE\n329, relied on.\n1.8. Applying the test of \"general application\", a H\n614 SUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2010] 3 S.C.R.\nA regulation stands on a higher pedestal vis-à-vis an Order\n(decision) of CERC in the sense that an order has to be\nin conformity with the regulations. However, that would\nnot mean that a regulation is a pre-condition to the order\n(decision). Therefore, it cannot be said that under the\nB 2003 Act, power to make regulations u/s. 178 has to be\ncorrelated to the functions ascribed to each authority\nunder the 2003 Act and that CERC can enact regulations\nonly on topics enumerated in s. 178(2). Apart from\nSection 178(1) which deals with \"generality\" even u/s.\nC 178(2)(ze), CERC could enact a regulation on any topic\nwhich may not fall in the enumerated list provided such\npower falls within the scope of the 2003 Act. Trading is\nan activity recognized under the 2003 Act. While deciding\nthe nature of an order (decision) vis-à-vis a regulation\nunder the Act, one needs to apply the test of general\napplication. [Para 43] [672-E-H]\nD\nU.P. State Electricity Board, Lucknow v. City Board,\nMussoorie (1985) 2 SCC 16; M/s Jagdamba Paper Industries\n(Pvt.) Ltd. and Ors. v. Haryana State Electricity Board and Ors.\nE AIR 1983 SC 1296; Kerala State Electricity Board v. S.N.\nGovinda Prabhu and Bros. and Ors.

Union of India and\nOrs. (1985) 1 SCC 641; City Board, Mussoorie v. State\nElectricity Board and Ors. AIR (58) 1971 Allahabad 219,\nreferred to.\n1.9. On the making of the impugned Regulations\n2006, even the existing Power Purchase Agreements\n(\"PPA\") had to be modified and aligned with the said\nRegulations. The impugned Regulation makes an inroad\ninto even the existing contracts. This itself indicates the\nH width of the power conferred on CERC u/s. 178 of the\nPTC INDIA LTD. v. CENTRAL ELECTRICITY\nREGULATORY COMM. THR. SECRY.\n615\n2003 Act. All contracts coming into existence after making A\nof the impugned Regulations 2006 have also to factor in\nthe capping of the trading margin. This itself indicates that\nthe impugned Regulations are in the nature of\nsubordinate legislation. Such regulatory intervention into\nthe existing contracts across-the-board could have been B\ndone only by making Regulations u/s. 178 and not by\npassing an Order u/s. 79(1)(j) of the 2003 Act. Therefore,\nit becomes clear that the word \"order\" in Section 111 of\nthe 2003 Act cannot include the impugned Regulations\n2006 made u/s. 178 of the 2003 Act. [Para 43] [672-H; 673-\nA-D]\nC\n1.10. If a dispute arises in adjudication on\ninterpretation of a regulation made u/s. 178, an appeal\nwould certainly lie before the Appellate Tribunal under\nSection 111, however, no appeal to the Appellate Tribunal D\nshall lie on the validity of a regulation made under Section\n178. [Para 59] [685-E]\n2.1. On the question of \"generality versus\nenumeration” principle, the enumerated factors/topics in E\na provision do not mean that the authority cannot take\nany other matter into consideration which may be\nrelevant. The words in the enumerated provision are not\na fetter; they are not words of limitation, but they are\nwords for general guidance. [Para 49] [677-C-F]\nHindustan Zinc Ltd. etc. v. Andhra Pradesh State\nElectricity Board and Ors. (1991) 3 SCC 299; Shri Sitaram\nSugar Co. Ltd. v. Union of India and Ors. (1990) 3 SCC 223,\nrelied on.\nLL\nF\nG\n2.2. Applying the principle of \"generality versus\nenumeration\", it would be open to the Central\nCommission to make a regulation on any residuary item\nu/s. 178(1) r/w Section 178(2)(ze). The CERC was\nempowered to cap the trading margin under the authority H\nA\nB\nC\nE\n616 SUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2010] 3 S.C.R.\nof delegated legislation u/s. 178 vide the impugned\nNotification dated 23.1.2006. [Para 59] [685-F-G]\n3.1. Section 121 of the 2003 Act does not confer\npower of judicial review on the Appellate Tribunal. The\nwords \"orders\", \"instructions\" or \"directions\" in Section\n121 do not confer power of judicial review in the Appellate\nTribunal for Electricity. In the 2003 Act, the power of\njudicial review of the validity of the Regulations made u/\ns. 178 is not conferred on the Appellate Tribunal for\nElectricity. [Para 59] [685-B-D]\nM/s Raman and Raman Ltd. v. State of Madras and Ors.\nAIR 1959 SC 694, relied on.\n3.2. It is not correct to say that s. 121 has not yet been\nD brought into force. At the outset, the material brought on\nrecord indicates that Section 121 of the original Electricity\nAct, 2003, was never brought into force because some\nMPs expressed the concern that the power, under that\nSection, conferred upon the Chairperson of the Appellate\nTribunal, could lead to excessive centralization of power\nand interference with the day-to-day activities of the\nCommission by the Chairperson of the Tribunal.\nTherefore, Section 121 was amended by Electricity\n(Amendment) Act, 2003 (No.57 of 2003) and which\namendment Act came into force from 27.1.2004. By\nnecessary implication of the coming into force of the\nElectricity (Amendment) Act, 2003 (No.57 of 2003) all\nprovisions amended by it also came into force, hence\nthere is no requirement for a further Notification u/s. 1(3),\nparticularly when Section 121 in its amended form has\ncome into force w.e.f. 27.1.2004. Section 121 of the\noriginal Act stood substituted by Amendment Act No. 57\nof 2003. Substitution of a provision results in repeal of the\nearlier provision and its replacement by the new\nprovision. Substitution is a combination of repeal and\nH fresh enactment. [Para 58] [683-D-G]\nF\nG\nPTC INDIA LTD. v. CENTRAL ELECTRICITY\nREGULATORY COMM. THR.
