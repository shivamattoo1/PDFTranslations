Bank advanced agricultural loans to its constituents\nand also members of the staff. The All India Overseas Bank Employees\nUnion (‘Union') raised a dispute taking the stand that the jewel appraisers\nengaged by the bank are part time workers of the bank. Relying upon a\ndecision in Indian Bank's case, the Tribunal answered the reference in\nthe affirmative. Union filed writ petition claiming that the Tribunal should\nhave granted relief from 1.4.1978 i.e. date of demand. Appellant-Bank also E\nquestioned legality of the award by filing a writ petition. The writ petition\nwas dismissed by the Single Judge and the Division Bench in the LPA.\nIt was contended by the respondent that the reference was made\nbecause prima facie the Government felt that jewel appraisers were\nworkmen under the Act and in that context, the nature of work, which F\nwas the same as in the case of Indian Bank's case is relevant. It was also\ncontended that three forums have recorded findings of fact and, therefore,\nno interference is called for. It was not a case where respondents were\nasking for regularization, they were claiming to be part-time workers.\nThere was power of the Bank to supervise and that was the effective G\ncontrol. The Bank has right to indicate as to in what manner the work\nwas to be done.\nAppellant, on the other hand, contended that the factual scenario in\nIndian Bank's case was entirely different. One of the determinative factors\n19\nH\n20\n20\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2006] 3 S.C.R.\nA according to him was that the commission was paid only when the loan\nwas sanctioned even if the appraisal had been done by the appraiser and\nthe commission amount was paid out of the sanctioned loan amount and\nthe payment is made by the borrower and not by the Bank. In any event\nafter the Shastri Award there is no question of any part time clerk being\nappointed.\nB\nC\nAllowing the appeal, the Court\nHELD: Since the Jewel appraisers were not subject to any prescribed\nqualification and age, their recruitment was not through Employment\nExchange/Banking Service Recruitment Board but was direct engagement\nby the local Manager, had no fixed working hours, were not paid monthly\nwages nor any guaranteed payment but only commission was paid, not\nsubject to disciplinary control, no control/supervision over the nature of\nwork to be performed, not paid wages by the Bank but got charges paid\nby the borrowers, no retirement age, were not subject to transfer, were\nD not barred from carrying on any avocation or occupation, the jewel\nappraisers, therefore, are not employees of the Bank.

UNION [PASAYAT,J.] 21\nMs. Meera Mathur for Intervention.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nA\nARIJIT PASAYAT, J. The Indian Overseas Bank (hereinafter referred\nto as the 'Bank') calls in question legality of view expressed in a judgment\nrendered by the Industrial Tribunal, Tamil Nadu, Chennai(hereinafter referred B\nto as the 'Tribunal') which was affirmed by learned Single Judge of the\nMadras High Court. The judgment of the Division Bench is the subject-\nmatter of challenge in this appeal.\nThe core question which falls for adjudication in this appeal is whether\n\"jewel appraisers for loans\" are to be treated as workers and are to be absorbed C\nas part time clerical staff of the Bank. Stand of the appellant is that jewel\nappraisers are not employees of the bank and do not do any substantial work.\nBackground facts in a nutshell are as follows:\nThe bank on the basis of contracts had employed about 767 jewel D\nappraisers mainly in the rural branches in the States of Tamil Nadu,\nPondicherry, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala and few branches in Bihar\nand Orissa. Bank advances agricultural loans to its constituents and also\nmembers of the staff. The All India Indian Overseas Bank Employees Union\n(in short the 'Union') raised a dispute taking the stand that the jewel appraisers\nengaged by the bank are part time workers of the bank. On the basis of the\ndemand raised reference was made by the Central Government and on\n19.2.1990 following dispute was referred to the Tribunal for adjudication:\nE\n\"Whether the demand of All India Overseas Bank Employees Union\nto treat the jewel appraisers engaged by the Bank as part time workmen F\nof the Bank is justified? If so, to what relief, if any, are they entitled?”\nIn support of the demand the stand taken was that the jewel appraisers\nemployed for particular branches of the bank are also utilized for certain\nclerical jobs like entering applications for jewel loans. They are also to go\nother branches as to the appraisers of the jewel. These jewel appraisers are G\nrequired to be present in the respective branches between 10 a.m. to 2.00\np.m. as a request for jewel loan is considered and granted only during that\nperiod. They are paid a commission of Rs.3/- for every one thousand rupees\nsanctioned by way of loan. Reference was made to another dispute i.e. ID 25\nof 1997 raised by jewel appraisers numbering about 353 in Indian Bank\nwhere a reference had been made to the Tribunal. The reference reads as\nH\n22\nA follows:-\nB\nC\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2006] 3 S.C.R.\n\"Whether the action of the Management of the Indian Bank, Madras\nin denying to appraisers wages and other conditions of service\napplicable to rural clerical \"Award Staff\" of the Bank is justified? If\nnot to what relief the workmen concerned are entitled to?\"\nReference in that case was made on the ground that the jewel appraisers\nof Indian Bank were workmen and they were denied only wages and other\nservice conditions as they were paid monthly remuneration of Rs. 100/-. The\nsaid dispute was adjudicated and an award was made on 3.12.1979 holding\nthat the jewel appraisers of Indian Bank are entitled to wages and other\nconditions of service applicable to regular clerical staff as part time employee\nof the Bank and they would be entitled to such proportionate (namely half)\nwages and benefits of clerical staff w.e.f. 1.4.1977 i.e. the date of reference.\nThe award was questioned before the High Court which was dismissed. Letters\nPatent Appeal was also dismissed by the Division Bench and S.L.P. was also\nD dismissed by this Court.\nStand of the Union, therefore, was that the view expressed in the Indian\nBank's case (supra) was clearly applicable to this case. Claim of the Union\nwas resisted by the appellant-Bank basically on the ground that jewel appraisers\nengaged by the Bank are not workmen as defined in Section 2(s) of the\nE Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (in short the ‘Act'). Reference was made a\ndecision of this Court in Management of Puri Urban Co-operative Bank v.\nMadhusudan Sahu and Anr., (1992) II LLJ 6. Further it was submitted that\nthe Bank has branches in various states and, therefore, adjudication is possible\nonly by a National Commission under Section 17B of the Act and not by the\nIndustrial Tribunal to whom the dispute was referred. This point was not,\nhowever, urged before the High Court. It was pointed out that terms and\nconditions of the jewel appraisers of Indian Bank were entirely different from\nthe terms and conditions of jewel appraisers of the appellant Indian Overseas\nBank. The Tribunal relied upon the decision in Indian Bank's case (supra)\nand answered the reference in the affirmative. It made a comparison of the\nG terms and conditions of the two Banks.\nF\nH\nUnion filed writ petition claiming that the Tribunal should have granted\nrelief from 1.4.1978 i.e date of demand. Appellant-Bank questioned legality\nof the award by filing a writ petition. As noted above, the writ petition was\ndismissed by the learned Single Judge and the Division Bench in the LPA.\n1\n}\n1\nGEN. MAN., INDIAN OVERSEAS BANK 1, WORKMEN, ALL INDIA OVERSEAS BANK EMP. UNION (PASAYAT.J.] 23\nIn support of the appeal learned counsel for the appellant-Bank submitted A\nthat in the year 1975 the appellant started the process of sanctioning loans on\ndeposit of jewellery and security for which jewel appraisers were engaged\nwho were paid on commission basis. On 20.1.1983 Government declined\nreference because independent contracts covered the arrangement. The Union\nfiled writ petition before the High Court which by its judgment dated\nB\n22.11.1989 directed the Central Government to refer the dispute to the\nTribunal. The Tribunal instead of assessing the evidence and very vital\nadmissions made by the witnesses examined to further the case of the jewel\nappraiser based its conclusions on Indian Bank's case (supra). It did not take\nnote of the features highlighted by this Court in Puri Urban Co-operative\nBanks' case (supra). It also referred to a decision in Indian Bank v. Presiding C\nOfficer, Industrial Tribunal etc., (1990) I LLJ 50, which had no relevance.\nAccordingly, the conclusions are vitiated of non-application of mind. It is\npointed out that though the learned Single Judge held that the Tribunal not\ndecided the real issues had proceeded to determine the case himself and\nupheld the award passed. In the appeal before the Division Bench it was\ncategorically held in the impugned judgment that the Tribunal had not\nadjudicated the correct issue and for achieving substantial justice the learned\nSingle Judge rightly adjudicated the matter which was pending for nearly 26\nyears. It was held that jewel appraisers are indispensable for proper functioning\nof the Bank and also deal with the clerical job.\nD\nE\nF\nIt was submitted by learned counsel for the appellant that the factual\nscenario in Indian Bank's case (supra) was entirely different. Some of the\ndistinguishing features make Indian Bank's case (supra) inapplicable. One of\nthe determinative factors according to him was that the commission was paid\nonly when the loan was sanctioned even if the appraisal had been done by\nthe appraiser and the commission amount was paid out of the sanctioned loan\namount and the payment is made by the borrower and not by the Bank. On\ncomparison of the works done the Tribunal held that the work was similar so\nfar as Indian Bank's case (supra) is concerned, without noticing that condition\nno.9 was conceptually and contextually different. There was no evidence to\nshow that jewel appraiser did any other work as clerk. Even if it is conceded G\nfor the sake of arguments that some work was done by the appraiser, it was\nby way of help to the loanee. In any event after the Shastri Award there is\nno question of any part time clerk being appointed. If the order of the Tribunal\nas maintained by learned Single Judge and the Division Bench is to be\nmaintained, a separate cadre has to be created to give effect to the orders.\nThe Tribunal referred to the Tiny Deposit Scheme of Indian Bank's case\nH\n24\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2006] 3 S.C.R.\nA without indicating as to how the same was relevant. The Tribunal quoted\nfrom the judgment of the Madras High Court in great detail and referred to\nEx. \"M-3\" which relied on some conclusions of Tiny Deposits Scheme which\nwas not the case of the jewel appraisers before the High Court. The Tribunal\nappears to have quoted from the said judgment of the Madras High Court and\nwithout applying the conditions which were the subject-matter of adjudication\nin the said case to the facts of the present case drew parallel. It was submitted\nthat the factual scenario in the Puri Co-operative Bank's case (supra) was\nalmost akin to the facts of the present case. Therefore, the ratio has full\napplication in the present case. Reference was also made to a Full Bench\njudgment of Kerala High Court in Canara's Bank case (1981) II LLJ 189\nC where for the purpose of the Shop and Commercial Establishment Act jewel\nappraisers were held to be not employees.\nB\nD\nIt was, however, submitted by learned counsel for the respondent that\nthis was done for the purpose of finding out the parameters.\nIt was submitted that the reference was made because prima facie the\nGovernment felt that jewel appraisers were workmen under the Act and in\nthat context nature of work, which was the same as in the case of Indian\nBank's case (supra), is relevant. The Tribunal has compared the duties and\nhas given findings of fact regarding nature of duties. It was held that the\nE jewel appraisers are also doing some clerical work relating to the job entrusted.\nF\nG\nThree forums have recorded findings of fact and, therefore, no interference\nis called for. This is not a case where jewel appraisers were asking for\nregularization, they were claiming to be part time workers. There was power\nof the Bank to supervise and that was the effective control. The Bank has\nright to indicate as to in what manner the work was to be done. In Puri\nCooperative Bank's case (supra) this Court did not notice an earlier three-\njudge Bench decision in Silver Jubilee Tailoring House and Ors. v. Chief\nInspector of Shops and Establishments and Anr., [1974] 3 SCC 498 where\nthe relevance of the end-product was highlighted. As the bank had the right\nto reject the report of the appraiser, that itself was indicative of element of\ncontrol and supervision. Therefore, the Puri Co-operative Bank's case (supra)\nshould not be followed. Additionally, the said case related to an individual\nand issue of workman did not arise directly.\nThe stress of learned counsel for the appellant was that the Bank had\nalways the practice of appointing jewel appraisers as independent contactors\nH who were free to work elsewhere and as such are not employees, not subject\n1\nރ\nGEN. MAN., INDIAN OVERSEAS BANK 1. WORKMEN, ALL INDIA OVERSEAS BANK EMP. UNION [PASAYAT, J.] 25\nto discipline, are not subject to fixed working hours, are not employed by A\nfollowing any employment procedure and are not assigned duty outside of\ntheir contract, except may be incidentally filing of form and the like.\nB\nC\nReference to the circular dated 23.8.1975 clearly shows that the Bank\nhad clearly stipulated that the jewel appraisers cannot be engaged in other\nwork as they were not regular employees. On 2.1.1978 another circular was\nissued by the Bank that jewel appraisers act on commission basis and hence\nare not entitled to do any other work. It appears that the Tribunal did not\nanalyse the evidence which was produced by the parties. It merely referred\nto the factual background in Indian Bank's case (supra). The decision of this\nCourt in Puri Co-operative Bank's case (supra) was distinguished by\ncomparing job of the jewel appraisers of the Indian Bank. It should be noted\nthat the dispute in Indian Bank's case (supra) was conceptually different.\nAfter accepting that the real issues were not focused by the Tribunal, learned\nSingle Judge held that a substantial portion of the Bank's business was because\nof the contribution made by the jewel appraisers without indicating as to how\nsame was relevant for the purpose of adjudication. The Division Bench in D\nvery cryptic manner observed that it had perused the evidence and the\ndocuments which substantiated nature of the job of the jewel appraisers and\nthey were also doing the clerical job. The circulars issued by the Bank were\nnot considered relevant and it was noted that the ratio in Indian Bank's case\n(supra) applies.\na\nE\nA few distinguishing facts need to be noted. In Indian Bank's case\n(supra) there was evidence to show that the jewel appraisers work regularly\nfor four hours. It was clearly admitted in the instant case by the witness of\njewel appraisers that there were no fixed period of work and they could come\nand go at any point of time. In Indian Bank's case (supra) the bank had F\ndisciplinary control on the jewel appraisers. In the instant case it was admitted\nby the witnesses that the Bank did not exercise any disciplinary control. In\nIndian Bank's case (supra) conditions were to be fulfilled before any leave\nwas granted. In the present case the jewel appraisers were not required to\nsign attendance register and also were not required to make any leave\napplication. The most relevant factor in Indian Bank's case (supra) was that\nthe jewel appraisers were paid a minimum amount per month which was\nsomewhat akin to salary. In the instant case, the amount was paid on\ncommission basis by the loanee and not by the bank.\nG\nA few other facts need to be noted. In the present case as well as in\nH\nPuri Co-operative Bank's case (supra) the jewel appraisers were required to\n26\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2006] 3 S.C.R.\nA weigh the ornaments brought to the Bank for pledge and to appraise quality,\nB\nC\nᎠ\nE\npurity and value. The jewel appraisers could be asked to do this exercise but\nnot the manner in which it was to be done. In both the cases the respective\nbanks had their lists of appraisers. It was not obligatory for the Bank to allot\nwork to any particular jewel appraiser.\nStrong reliance was placed by learned counsel for the respondent in\nDhrangadhra Chemical Works Ltd. v. State of Saurashtra, [1957] SCR 152,\nSilver Jubilee's case (supra), Shining Tailors v. Industrial Tribunal II, U.P.,\n[1983] 4 SCC 464, Chintaman Rao v. State of M.P., [1958] SCR 1340.\nThe inferences culled out from the reading of those judgments can be\nsummed up as follows:-\n(a) Where the contactors were substantially responsible for the main\nand sole business, they would be treated as workers.\n(b) One exception is that in such cases flexibility of the contract was\nat variance with normal worker's contract the contractors would not be treated\nas workers.\n(c) Where the contractor is in the nature of supplier of goods and\nservices, they are to be treated as supplier contractors and not workmen.\nAt this juncture the distinction between jewel appraisers and the regular\nemployees of the bank can be noted.\nRegular Employees\nJewel Appraisers\nF\n1.
