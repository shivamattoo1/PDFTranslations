The prosecution case was that the\ndeceased complained ill-treatment and torture at the hands of the appellant\nand his family members for non-fulfilling their demand of dowry. The trial\ncourt convicted the appellant of the offence and sentenced him to 10 years\nrigorous imprisonment. On appeal by the accused, the High Court\nconfirmed the conviction but reduced the sentenced to 7 years RI.\nIn the appeal filed by the accused before the Supreme Court it was\ncontended for the appellant that there was no live link between the dowry\ndemand and the death of the deceased and that the doctor categorically\nstated that cause of death was not ascertainable, and as such, the courts\nbelow erred in recording conviction of the appellant.\n903\nF\nG\nH\n904\nA\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2005] 1 S.C.R.\nDismissing the appeal, the Court\nHELD 1.1. As per the definition of 'dowry death' in s.304-B IPC\nand the wording in the presumptive s. 113-B of the Evidence Act, one of\nthe essential ingredients, amongst others, in both the provisions is that the\nconcerned woman must have been “soon before her death\" subjected to\nB cruelty or harassment “for or in connection with the demand of dowry\".\nPresumption under s. 113-B of the Evidence Act is a presumption of law.\nOn proof of the essentials mentioned therein, it becomes obligatory on the\nCourt to raise a presumption that the accused caused the dowry death.\nProsecution has to rule out the possibility of a natural or accidental death\nso as to bring it within the purview of the 'death occurring otherwise than\nin normal circumstances'. The expression ‘soon before' is very relevant\nwhere s. 113-B of the Evidence Act and s. 304-B IPC are pressed into\nservice. Prosecution is obliged to show that soon before the occurrence\nthere was cruelty or harassment and only in that case presumption\noperates. Evidence in that regard has to be led by prosecution.\nC\nᎠ\n[909-A-B-E-F]\n1.2. 'Soon before' is a relative term and it would depend upon\ncircumstances of each case and no strait-jacket formula can be laid down\nas to what would constitute a period of soon before the occurrence. The\nexpression 'soon before her death' used in the substantive s. 304-B IPC\nE and s. 113-B of the Evidence Act is present with the idea of proximity test.\nNo definite period has been indicated and the expression 'soon before' is\nnot defined. There must be existence of a proximate and live-link between\nthe effects of cruelty based on dowry demand and the concerned death. If\nalleged incident of cruelty is remote in time and has become stale enough\nnot to disturb mental equilibrium of the woman concerned, it would be\nof no consequence. [909-F-H; 910-A-C]\nF\n1.3. In the instant case, evidence of Pws 1, 3 and 6 amply established\ndemand of dowry and ill treatment of the deceased shortly before the date\nof occurrence. The trial court and the High Court were justified in drawing\nG the conclusion about guilt of the accused. If the death was normal as\nclaimed by the accused, nothing was brought on record to explain injuries\non the neck of the deceased. As noted by the trial court and the High\nCourt, black stained rough skin on both sides of neck was found. It has\nalso been noticed by the doctor who conducted the post-mortem\nexamination that blood stained fluid was trickling from the side of mouth\nH\nKAMESH PANJIYAR v. STATE OF BIHAR [ARIJIT PASAYAT. J.]\n905\nand brain matters were found congested. The doctor unfortunately did. A\nnot consider the effect of the marks on the neck and trickling of blood\nstained fluid from the mouth. The I.O. (PW-9) had seized a blood stained\npillow. There was no evidence that the death was due to normal reasons.\nThe evidence on record clearly establishes the commission of offence by\nthe accused. Therefore, the conviction and the modified sentence as\nimposed by the High Court do not suffer from any infirmity to warrant\ninterference. [911-G-H; 912-A-C❘\nCRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Criminal Appeal No. 205\nof 2005.\nB\nFrom the Judgment and Order dated 15.10.2003 of the Patna High\nCourt in Crl.A.No. 39 of 1992(SJ).\nC\nPrabhash Kumar Yadav and Dr. Krishan Singh Chauhan for the\nAppellant.\nB.B. Singh and Kumar Rajesh Singh for the Respondent.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nARIJIT PASAYAT, J. Leave granted.\nD\nMarriages are made in heaven, is an adage. A bride leaves the parental E\nhome for the matrimonial home, leaving behind sweet memories therewith a\nhope that she will see a new world full of love in her groom's house. She\nleaves behind not only her memories, but also her surname, gotra and\nmaidenhood. She expects not only to be a daughter-in-law, but a daughter in\nfact. Alas! the alarming rise in the number of cases involving harassment to\nthe newly wed girls for dowry shatters the dreams. In-laws are characterized\nto be outlaws for perpetrating terrorism which destroys the matrimonial home.\nThe terrorist is dowry, and it is spreading tentacles in every possible direction.\nF\nAppellant calls in question legality of the judgment rendered by a learned\nSingle Judge of the Patna High Court upholding his conviction for offences\nG\npunishable under Section 304-B of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short the\n'IPC'), while reducing sentences to seven years rigorous imprisonment from\nten years imprisonment as was awarded by learned Sessions Judge, Sitamarhi.\nProsecution version as unfolded during trial is as follows:\nH\nA\nB\n906\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2005] 1 S.C.R.\nJaikali Devi (hereinafter referred to as the deceased) was sister of the\ninformant, Sudhir Kumar Mahto (PW-6). She was married to appellant in\n1988. Duragaman was subsequently performed in the month of August, 1989.\nA sum of Rs. 40,000 was demanded in dowry at the time of marriage and the\nsame was paid. Subsequently, demand for a she-buffalo was made by the\nappellant at the time of Duragaman which could not be fulfilled. Informant\nSudhir Kumar Mahto (PW-6) went several times to the house of her sister\nand made request for Bidagari of her sister, but the same was not allowed,\nand on the contrary demand of she-buffalo was pressed. The deceased\ncomplained of ill-treatment and torture at the hands of the appellant and other\nmembers of his family. The informant was also abused. On 28.11.1989 at\nC about 7.00 a.m., the informant heard some rumour in the village that her\nsister-the deceased was murdered by the appellant and his family members,\nand they were contemplating to dispose of the dead body. Thereafter, the\ninformant along with his father Bachu Mahto (PW-3), brother Anup Mahto\n(PW-5) and uncle Bhuneshwar Mahto (PW-7) went to the village of the\nappellant and found that the dead body of her sister was lying in the verandah\nD of the appellant's house and some blood was oozing from her mouth and\nthere were mark of violence on her neck and it appeared that his sister was\nmurdered by strangulation in the previous night. The officer In-charge of\nKanhauli Police Station reached in the village Araria on hearing rumours\nabout murder of a lady and he recorded the Fardbeyan (Ext.1) of the informant.\nHe sent Fardbeyan to the Officer In-charge of Kanhauli Police Station for\ninstituting a case. He made inquest on the dead body of the deceased and\nprepared inquest report and sent the dead body to Sitamarhi Sadar Hospital\nfor post mortem examination and a formal FIR was drawn up. The police\nafter completion of investigation submitted charge sheet.\nE\nF\nAppellant pleaded innocence. In order to further its version prosecution\nexamined 9 witnesses. As noted above, Sudhir Kumar Mahto (PW-6) was the\ninformant. According to his evidence shortly before the occurrence, he had\ntalked with his sister i.e. the deceased, who told him about the tortures meted\nout to her for not bringing the dowry articles. To similar effect is the evidence\nof Dayanand Mahto (PW-1) who claimed to have accompanied PW-6 and\nG\nheard deceased telling PW-6 about the torture. Bachu Mahto (PW-3) the\nfather of the deceased also stated about the demand. PW-8 is the doctor who\nconducted the post-mortem. Three witnesses were examined by the accused\nto substantiate his plea that the deceased had rheumatic disease and she died\nbecause of this. The trial Court considered the evidence on record and came\nH to hold that the presumption in terms of Section 113(B) of the Indian Evidence\nKAMESH PANJIYAR v. STATE OF BIHAR [ARIJIT PASAYAT. J.] 907\nAct, 1872 (in short 'the Evidence Act') was to be drawn and since the\ndeceased did not die a natural death as claimed, the accused was guilty of\noffence in terms of Section 304-B IPC. It was noticed that there was no\nevidence to show that the deceased suffered from any rheumatic disease. The\nevidence of DWs was found to be unreliable. Accordingly, conviction in\nterms of Section 304-B was recorded and ten years sentence was imposed.\nQuestioning the conviction and the sentence as awarded by the learned\ntrial Judge, the accused filed an appeal before the High Court. As noted\nabove, the High Court upheld the conviction but reduced the sentence.\nA\nB\nIn support of the appeal, learned counsel for the appellant submitted\nthat the doctor (PW-8) had categorically stated that the causes of death was C\nnot ascertainable. The trial Court and the High Court were not justified in\napplying Section 304-B IPC to the facts of the case. There was no livelink\nestablished between the alleged demand of dowry and the purported unnatural\ndeath. That being so, the conviction as recorded is not tenable.\nIn response, learned counsel for the State submitted that the Courts\nbelow have analysed the factual position in detail and found the accused-\nappellant guilty. That being so, no fault can be found with the orders of the\nCourts below.\nSection 304-B IPC deals with dowry death which reads as follows:\nD\nE\n\"304B. Dowry Death - (1) where the death of a woman is caused by\nany burns or bodily injury or occurs otherwise than under normal\ncircumstances within seven years of her marriage and it is shown that\nsoon before her death she was subjected to cruelty or harassment by\nher husband or any relative of her husband for, or in connection with F\nany demand for dowry, such death shall be called \"dowry death\" and\nsuch husband or relative shall be deemed to have caused her death.\nExplanation For the purpose of this sub-section 'dowry' shall have\nsome meaning as in Section 2 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961\n(28 of 1961).\n(2) Whoever commits dowry death shall be punished with\nimprisonment for a term which shall not be less than seven years' but\nwhich may extend to imprisonment for life.\nG\nThe provision has application when death of a woman is caused by any burns H\nA\n908\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2005] 1 S.C.R.\nor bodily injury or occurs otherwise than under normal circumstances within\nseven years of her marriage and it is shown that soon before her death she\nwas subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or any relatives of her\nhusband for, or in connection with any demand for dowry.\nIn order to attract application of Section 304-IPC, the essential\nB ingredients are as follows:\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\n(i) The death of a woman should be caused by burns or bodily injury\nor otherwise than under a normal circumstance.\n(ii) Such a death should have occurred within seven years of her\nmarriage.\n(iii) She must have been subjected to cruelty or harassment by her\nhusband or any relative of her husband.\n(iv) Such cruelty or harassment should be for or in connection with\ndemand of dowry.\n(v) Such cruelty or harassment is shown to have been meted out to\nbe the woman soon before her death.\nSection 113B of the Evidence Act is also relevant for the case at hand. Both\nSection 304-B IPC and Section 113B of the Evidence Act were inserted by\nthe Dowry prohibition (Amendment) Act 43 of 1986 with a view to combat\nthe increasing menace of dowry deaths. Section 113b reads as follows:\n\"113B: Presumption as to dowry death - when the question is whether\na person has committed the dowry death of a woman and it is shown\nthat soon before her death such woman has been subjected by such\nperson to cruelty or harassment for, or in connection with, any demand\nfor dowry, the Court shall presume that such person had caused the\ndowry death.\nExplanation For the purposes of this section 'dowry death' shall\nhave the same meaning as in Section 304-B of the Indian Penal Code\n(45 of 1860).\"\nThe necessity for insertion of the two provisions has been amply analysed by\nthe Law Commission of Indian in its 21st Report dated 10th August, 1988 on\n'Dowry Deaths and Law Reform'. Keeping in view the impediment in the\npre-existing law in securing evidence to prove dowry related deaths, legislature\nH thought it wise to insert a provision relating to presumption of dowry death\nنمیر\nKAMESH PANJIYAR v. STATE OF BIHAR [ARIJIT PASAYAT, J.] 909\non proof of certain essentials. It is in this background presumptive Section A\n113B in the Evidence Act has been inserted. As per the definition of ‘dowry\ndeath' in Section 304B IPC and the wording in the presumptive Section 113B\nof the Evidence Act, one of the essential ingredients, amongst others, in both\nthe provisions is that the concerned woman must have been “soon before her\ndeath\" subjected to cruelty or harassment \"for or in connection with the\ndemand of dowry\". Presumption under Section 113B is a presumption of B\nlaw. On proof of the essentials mentioned therein, it becomes obligatory on\nthe Court to raise presumption that the accused caused the dowry death. The\npresumption shall be raised only on proof of the following essentials:\n(1) The question before the Court must be whether the accused has\ncommitted the dowry death of a woman. (This means that the\npresumption can be raised only if the accused is being tried for the\noffence under Section 304B IPC).\n(2) The woman was subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband\nor his relatives.\n(3) Such cruelty or harassment was for, or in connection with any\ndemand for dowry.\n(4) Such cruelty or harassment was soon before her death.\nC\nD\nA conjoint reading of Section 113B of the Evidence Act and Section E\n304-B shows that there must be material to show that soon before her death,\nthe victim was subjected to cruelty or harassment. Prosecution has to ru:e out\nthe possibility of a natural or accidental death so as to bring it within the\npurview of the 'death occurring otherwise than in normal circumstances'.\nThe expression 'soon before' is very relevant where Section 113B of the\nF\nEvidence Act and Section 304B IPC are pressed into service. Prosecution is\nobliged to show that soon before the occurrence there was cruelty or\nharassment and only in that case presumption operates. Evidence in that\nregard has to be led by prosecution. 'Soon before' is a relative term and it\nwould depend upon circumstances of each case and no strait-jacket formula\ncan be laid down as to what would constitute a period of soon before the G\noccurrence. It would be hazardous to indicate any fixed period, and that\nbrings in the importance of a proximity test both for the proof of an offence\nof dowry death as well as for raising a presumption under Section 113B of\nthe Evidence Act. The expression 'soon before her death' used in the\nsubstantive Section 304B IPC and Section 113B of the Evidence Act is\nH\nB\n910\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2005] 1 S.C.R.\nA present with the idea of proximity test. No definite period has been indicated\nand the expression 'soon before' is not defined. A reference to expression\n'soon before' used in Section 114. Illustration (a) of the Evidence Act is\nrelevant. It lays down that a Court many presume that a man who is in the\npossession of goods soon after the theft, is either the thief has received the\ngoods knowing them to be stolen, unless he can account for his possession.\nThe determination of the period which can come within the term 'soon before'\nis left to be determined by the Courts, depending upon facts and circumstances\nof each case. Suffice, however, to indicate that the expression 'soon before'\nwould normally imply that the interval should not be much between the\nconcerned cruelty or harassment and the death in question. There must be\nC existence of a proximate and live-link between the effects of cruelty based on\ndowry demand and the concerned death. If alleged incident of cruelty is\nremote in time and has become stale enough not to disturb mental equilibrium\nof the woman concerned, it would be of no consequence.\nConsequences of cruelty which are likely to drive a woman to commit\nD suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health, whether\nE\nmental or physical of the woman is required to be established in order to\nbring home the application of Section 498A IPC. Cruelty has been defined\nin the Explanation for the purpose of Section 498A. Substantive Section\n498A IPC and presumptive Section 113A of the Evidence Act have been\ninserted in the respective statutes by Criminal Law (Second Amendment)\nAct, 1983. It is to be noted that Sections 304B and 498A, IPC cannot be held\nto be mutually inclusive. These provisions deal with two distinct offences. It\nis true that cruelty is a common essential to both the Sections and that has\nto be proved. The Explanation to Section 498A gives the meaning of 'cruelty'.\nIn Section 304B thereis no such explanation about the meaning of 'cruelty'.\nF But having regard to common background to these offences it has to be taken\nthat the meaning of 'cruelty' or 'harassment' is the same as prescribed in the\nExplanation to Section 498A under which 'cruelty' by itself amounts to an\noffence. Under Section 304B it is ‘dowry death' that is punishable and such\ndeath should have occurred within seven years of marriage. No such period\nis mentioned in Section 498A. If the case is established, there can be a\nG\nconviction under both the sections. (See Akula Ravinder and Ors. v. The\nState of Andhra Pradesh, AIR (1991) SC 1142. Period of operation of Section\n113B of the Evidence Act is Seven Years, Presumption arises when a woman\ncommitted suicide within a period of seven years from the date of marriage.\nH\nSection 2 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 (in short 'Dowry Act')\n3\nt\nKAMESH PANJIYAR v. STATE OF BIHAR [ARIJIT PASAYAT. J.]\ndefines \"dowry\" as under :-\n911\nSection 2. Definition of 'dowry' - In this Act, ‘dowry' means any\nproperty or valuable security given or agreed to be given either directly\nor indirectly -\n(a) by one party to a marriage to the other party to the marriage;\nor\n(b) by the parents of either party to a marriage or by any other\nperson, to either party to the marriage or to any other person,\nA\nB\nat or before or any time after the marriage in connection with the\nmarriage of the said parties, but does not include dower or mehr in C\nthe case of persons to whom the Muslim personal law (Shariat) applies.\nExplanation I - For the removal of doubts, it is hereby declared that\nany presents made at the time of a marriage to either party to the\nmarriage in the form of cash, ornaments, clothes or other articles,\nshall not be deemed to be dowry within the meaning of this section, D\nunless they are made as consideration for the marriage of the said\nparties.\nExplanation II The expression 'valuable security' has the same\nmeaning in Section 30 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860).”\nE\nThe word \"dowry\" in Section 304-B IPC has to be understood as it is\ndefined in Section 2 of the Dowry Act. Thus, there are three occasions\nrelated to dowry. One is before the marriage, second is at the time of marriage\nand the third \"at any time\" after the marriage. The third occasion may appear\nto be unending period. But the crucial words are \"in connection with the\nmarriage of the said parties\". Other payments which are customary payments F\ne.g. given at the time of birth of a child or other ceremonies as are prevalent\nin different societies are not covered by the expression \"dowry\". (See Satvir\nSingh v. State of Punjab, [2001] 8 SCC 633 As was observed in said case\n\"suicidal death\" of a married woman within seven years of her marriage is\ncovered by the expression “death of a woman is caused ......or occurs otherwise\nG\nthan under normal circumstances\" as expressed in Section 304-B IPC.\nIn the instant case, great stress has been laid on the opinion of the\ndoctor that possible cause of death was not ascertainable. As noted by the\ntrial Court and the High Court, black stained rough skin on both sides of neck\nwas found. It has also been noticed by the doctor who conducted the post- H\nA\n912\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2005] 1 S.C.R.\nmortem examination that blood stained fluid was trickling from the side of\nmouth and brain matters were found congested. The doctor unfortunately did\nnot consider the effect of the marks on the neck and trickling of blood stained\nfluid from the mouth. The I.O. (PW-9) had seized a blood stained pillow.\nThere was no evidence that the death was due to normal reasons. Evidence\nof PWs 1, 3 and 6 amply established demand of dowry and ill treatment of\nB the deceased shortly before the date of occurrence. The trail Court and the\nHigh Court were justified in drawing the conclusion about guilt of the accused.\nThough attempt was made to show that had the accused been guilty he along\nwith family members would not have tried to get treatment for the deceased.\nThe reason for this is not far too seek. The accused person and others were\ntyping to create a smoke screen. If the death was normal as claimed by the\nC\naccused, nothing was brought on record to explain injuries on the neck of the\ndeceased. The evidence on record clearly establishes the commission of offence\nby the accused. Therefore, the conviction and the modified sentence as imposed\nby the High Court do not suffer from any infirmity to warrant interference.\n•\nThe appeal is dismissed.\nD\nR.P.\nAppeal dismissed.\n"}
