R. GANDHI, PRESIDENT, MADRAS 907\nBAR ASSOCIATION [R.V. RAVEENDRAN, J.]\n124, this Court expressed the view that the Parliament can\nwithout in any way violating the basic structure doctrine make\neffective alternative institutional mechanisms or arrangements\nfor judicial review.\n:\n14. Though both Courts and Tribunals exercise judicial\npower and discharge similar functions, there are certain well-\nrecognised differences between courts and Tribunals. They are\nB\n(i) Courts are established by the State and are entrusted\nwith the State's inherent judicial power for administration of C\njustice in general. Tribunals are established under a statute to\nadjudicate upon disputes arising under the said statute, or\ndisputes of a specified nature. Therefore, all courts are\nTribunals. But all Tribunals are not courts.\n(ii) Courts are exclusively manned by Judges. Tribunals\ncan have a Judge as the sole member, or can have a\ncombination of a Judicial Member and a Technical Member who\nis an 'expert' in the field to which Tribunal relates. Some highly\nspecialized fact finding Tribunals may have only Technical\nMembers, but they are rare and are exceptions.\nD\nE\n(iii) While courts are governed by detailed statutory\nprocedural rules, in particular the Code of Civil Procedure and\nEvidence Act, requiring an elaborate procedure in decision\nmaking, Tribunals generally regulate their own procedure F\napplying the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure only\nwhere it is required, and without being restricted by the strict\nrules of Evidence Act.\nRe: Independence of judiciary\nG\n15. Impartiality, independence, fairness and\nreasonableness in decision making are the hallmarks of\nJudiciary. If 'Impartiality' is the soul of Judiciary, 'Independence'\nis the life blood of Judiciary. Without independence, impartiality\ncannot thrive. Independence is not the freedom for Judges to H\n908\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2010] 6 S.C.R.\nA do what they like. It is the independence of judicial thought. It\nis the freedom from interference and pressures which provides\nthe judicial atmosphere where he can work with absolute\ncommitment to the cause of justice and constitutional values. It\nis also the discipline in life, habits and outlook that enables a\nB Judge to be impartial. Its existence depends however not only\non philosophical, ethical or moral aspects but also upon several\nmundane things - security in tenure, freedom from ordinary\nmonetary worries, freedom from influences and pressures\nwithin (from others in the Judiciary) and without (from the\nC Executive).\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n16. In Union of India vs. Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth -\n1977 (4) SCC 193, a Constitution Bench of this Court\nexplained the importance of 'Independence of Judiciary' thus :\n\"Now the independence of the judiciary is a fighting faith\nof our Constitution. Fearless justice is a cardinal creed of\nour founding document. It is indeed a part of our ancient\ntradition which has produced great judges in the past. In\nEngland too, from where we have inherited our present\nsystem of administration of justice in its broad and\nessential features, judicial independence is prized as a\nbasic value and so natural and inevitable it has come to\nbe regarded and so ingrained it has become in the life and\nthought of the people that it is now almost taken for granted\nand it would be regarded an act of insanity for any one to\nthink otherwise......\nThe Constitution makers, therefore, enacted several\nprovisions designed to secure the independence of the\nsuperior judiciary by insulating it from executive or\nlegislative control,………………….\n...even with regard to the Subordinate Judiciary the\nframers of the Constitution were anxious to secure that it\nshould be insulated from executive interference and once\nappointment of a Judicial Officer is made, his subsequent\nUNION OF INDIA v. R. GANDHI, PRESIDENT, MADRAS 909\nBAR ASSOCIATION [R.V. RAVEENDRAN, J.]\ncareer should be under the control of the High Court and A\nhe should not be exposed to the possibility of any improper\nexecutive pressure.\"\nIn Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Association \u0026 Ors.\nv. Union of India (1993) 4 SCC 441, J.S. Verma, J. (as he then\nwas) speaking for the majority, described the attributes of an\nindependent judge thus:\nแ\nB\nOnly those persons should be considered fit for\nappointment as Judges of the superior judiciary who\ncombine the attributes essential for making an able, C\nindependent and fearless judge. Several attributes\ntogether combine to constitute such a personality. Legal\nexpertise, ability to handle cases, proper personal\nconduct and ethical behaviour, firmness and\nfearlessness are obvious essential attributes of a person D\nsuitable for appointment as a superior Judge.\".\n(emphasis supplied)\nIn his concurring opinion, Pandian J. stated that \"it is the\ncardinal principle of the Constitution that an independent\njudiciary is the most essential characteristic of a free society\nlike ours.\" He further stated:\nE\n\"..that to have an independent judiciary to meet all\nchallenges, unbending before all authorities and to uphold F\nthe imperatives of the Constitution at all times, thereby\npreserving the judicial integrity, the person to be elevated\nto the judiciary must be possessed with the highest\nreputation for independence, uncommitted to any prior\ninterest, loyalty and obligation and prepared under all G\ncircumstances or eventuality to pay any price, bear any\nburden and to meet any hardship and always wedded only\nto the principles of the Constitution and 'Rule of Law'. If\nthe selectee bears a particular stamp for the purpose of\nchanging the cause of decisions bowing to the diktat of H\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\n910\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2010] 6 S.C.R.\nhis appointing authority, then the independence of judiciary\ncannot be secured notwithstanding the guaranteed tenure\nof office, rights and privileges, safeguards, conditions of\nservice and immunity. Though it is illogical to spin out a\nnew principle that the keynote is not the judge but the\njudiciary especially when it is accepted in the same breath\nthat an erroneous appointment of an unsuitable person is\nbound to produce irreparable damage to the faith of the\ncommunity in the administration of justice and to inflict\nserious injury to the public interest and that the necessity\nfor maintaining independence of judiciary is to ensure a\nfair and effective administration of justice.\"\nThe framers of the Constitution stated in a Memorandum (\"See\nThe Framing of India's Constitution - B.Shiva Rao, volume I-\nB, Page 196) :\n\"We have assumed that it is recognized on all hands that\nthe independence and integrity of the judiciary in a\ndemocratic system of government is of the highest\nimportance and interest not only to the judges but to the\ncitizens at large who may have to seek redress in the last\nresort in courts of law against any illegal acts or the high-\nhanded exercise of power by the executive... in making\nthe following proposals and suggestions, the paramount\nimportance of securing the fearless functioning of an\nindependent and efficient judiciary has been steadily kept\nin view.\"\nIn L. Chandra Kumar, the seven Judge Bench of this Court\nheld:\n\"The Constitution of India while conferring power of judicial\nreview of legislative action upon the higher judiciary,\nincorporated important safeguards. An analysis of the\nmanner in which the Framers of our Constitution\nincorporated provisions relating to the judiciary would\nH\nUNION OF INDIA v. R. GANDHI, PRESIDENT, MADRAS 911\nBAR ASSOCIATION [R.V. RAVEENDRAN, J.]\nindicate that they were very greatly concerned with securing A\nthe independence of the judiciary.\"\n-\nIndependence of Judiciary has always been recognized as a\npart of the basic structure of the Constitution (See : Supreme\nCourt Advocates-on-Record Association vs. Union of India\n1993 (4) SCC 441, State of Bihar vs. Bal Mukund Shah -\n2000 (4) SCC 640, Shri Kumar Padma Prasad vs. Union of\nIndia – 1992 (2) SCC 428, and All India Judges Association\nvs. Union of India - 2002 (4) SCC 247).\nSeparation of Power.\n17. In Rai Sahib Ram Jawaya Kapur vs. The State of\nPunjab - 1955 (2) SCR 225, this Court explained the doctrine\nof separation of powers thus:\nB\nC\nD\n\"The Indian Constitution has not indeed recognised the\ndoctrine of separation of powers in its absolute rigidity but\nthe functions of the different parts or branches of the\nGovernment have been sufficiently differentiated and\nconsequently it can very well be said that our Constitution\ndoes not contemplate assumption, by one organ or part E\nof the State, of functions that essentially belong to another.\"\nIn Chandra Mohan vs. State of UP - AIR 1966 SC 1987, this\nCourt held :\n\"The Indian Constitution, though it does not accept the strict\ndoctrine of separation of powers, provides for an\nindependent judiciary in the States; it constitutes a High\nCourt for each State, prescribes the institutional conditions\nof service of the Judges thereof, confers extensive\njurisdiction on it to issue writs to keep all tribunals, including\nin appropriate cases the Governments, within bounds and\ngives to it the power of superintendence over all courts and\ntribunals in the territory over which it has jurisdiction. But\nthe makers of the Constitution also realised that “it is the\nG\nSubordinate Judiciary in India who are brought most H\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\n912\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2010] 6 S.C.R.\nclosely into contact with the people, and it is no less.\nimportant, perhaps indeed even more important, that their\nindependence should be placed beyond question than in\nthe case of the superior Judges.\" Presumably to secure\nthe independence of the judiciary from the executive, the\nConstitution introduced a group of articles in Ch. VI of Part\nVI under the heading \"Subordinate Courts\". But at the time\nthe Constitution was made, in most of the States the\nmagistracy was under the direct control of the executive.\nIndeed it is common knowledge that in pre-independent\nIndia there was a strong agitation that the judiciary should\nbe separated from the executive and that the agitation was\nbased upon the assumption that unless they were\nseparated, the independence of the judiciary at the lower\nlevels would be a mockery. So article 50 of the Directive\nPrinciples of Policy states that the State shall take steps\nto separate the judiciary from the executive in the public\nservices of the States. Simply stated, it means that there\nshall be a separate judicial service free from the\nexecutive control.\"\n(emphasis supplied)\nIn Indira Nehru Gandhi vs. Raj Narain - 1975 Supp SCC 1,\nthis Court observed that the Indian Constitution recognizes\nseparation of power in a broad sense without however their\nF being any rigid separation of power as under the American\nConstitution or under the Australian Constitution. This Court\nheld thus :\n0\nH\n\"It is true that no express mention is made in our\nConstitution of vesting in the judiciary the judicial power as\nis to be found in the American Constitution. But a division\nof the three main functions of Government is recognised\nin our Constitution. Judicial power in the sense of the\njudicial power of the State is vested in the Judiciary.\nSimilarly, the Executive and the Legislature are vested with\npowers in their spheres. Judicial power has lain in the\n:\nUNION OF INDIA v. R. GANDHI, PRESIDENT, MADRAS 913\nBAR ASSOCIATION [R.V. RAVEENDRAN, J.]\nhands of the Judiciary prior to the Constitution and also A\nsince the Constitution. It is not the intention that the powers\nof the Judiciary should be passed to or be shared by the\nExecutive or the Legislature or that the powers of the\nLegislature or the Executive should pass to or be shared\nby the Judiciary.\nB\n\"The Constitution has a basic structure comprising the\nthree organs of the Republic: the Executive, the Legislature\nand the Judiciary. It is through each of these organs that\nthe sovereign will of the people has to operate and\nC\nmanifest itself and not through only one of them. None of\nthese three separate organs of the Republic can take over\nthe functions assigned to the other. This is the basic\nstructure or scheme of the system of Government of\nRepublic..........\nD\n“But no constitution can survive without a conscious\nadherence to its fine checks and balances. Just as courts\nought to enter into problems entwined in the 'political\nthicket\", Parliament must also respect the preserve of the\ncourt. The principle of separation of powers is a principle E\nof restraint\n\"\nIn L. Chandra Kumar, the seven-Judge Bench of this Court\nreferred to the task entrusted to the superior courts in India thus\nF\n\"The Judges of the superior courts have been entrusted\nwith the task of upholding the Constitution and to this end,\nhave been conferred the power to interpret it. It is they who\nhave to ensure that the balance of power envisaged by\nthe Constitution is maintained and that the legislature and G\nthe executive do not, in the discharge of their functions,\ntransgress constitutional limitations. It is equally their duty\nto oversee that the judicial decisions rendered by those\nwho man the subordinate courts and tribunals do not fall\nH\nA\n914 SUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2010] 6 S.C.R.\nfoul of strict standards of legal correctness and judicial and\njudicial independence.\"\n(emphasis supplied)\n-\nThe doctrine of separation of powers has also been always\nB considered to be a part of the basic structure of the Constitution\n(See Keshavananda Bharati vs. State of Kerala – 1973 (4)\nSCC 225, Indira Gandhi vs. Raj Narain - 1975 Supp SCC 1,\nState of Bihar vs. Bal Mukund Shah - 2000 (4) SCC 640 and\nI.R. Coelho vs. State of Tamil Nadu - 2007 (2) SCC 1).\nC\nD\nThe argument in favour of Tribunals\n18. The argument generally advanced to support\ntribunalisation is as follows: The courts function under archaic\nand elaborate procedural laws and highly technical Evidence\nLaw. To ensure fair play and avoidance of judicial error, the\nprocedural laws provide for appeals, revisions and reviews, and\nallow parties to file innumerable applications and raise\nvexatious objections as a result of which the main matters get\npushed to the background. All litigation in courts get inevitably\nE delayed which leads to frustration and dissatisfaction among\nlitigants. In view of the huge pendency, courts are not able to\nbestow attention and give priority to cases arising under special\nlegislations. Therefore, there is a need to transfer some\nselected areas of litigation dealt with by traditional courts to\nF special Tribunals. As Tribunals are free from the shackles of\nprocedural laws and Evidence Law, they can provide easy\naccess to speedy justice in a 'cost-affordable' and 'user-\nfriendly' manner. Tribunals should have a Judicial Member and\na Technical Member. The Judicial Member will act as a bulwark\nG against apprehensions of bias and will ensure compliance with\nbasic principles of natural justice such as fair hearing and\nreasoned orders. The Judicial Member would also ensure\n'impartiality, fairness and reasonableness in consideration. The\npresence of Technical Member ensures the availability of\nH expertise and experience related to the field of adjudication for\nUNION OF INDIA v. R. GANDHI, PRESIDENT, MADRAS 915\nUNION\nBAR ASSOCIATION [R.V. RAVEENDRAN, J.]\nwhich the special Tribunal is created, thereby improving the A\nquality of adjudication and decision-making.\n19. United Kingdom has a rich experience of functioning\nof several types of Tribunals as dispute resolution-and-\ngrievance settlement mechanisms in regard to varied social\nwelfare legislations. Several Committees were constituted to\nstudy the functioning of the Tribunals, two of which require\nspecial mention. The first is the Franks Report which\nemphasized that Tribunals should be independent, accessible,\nprompt, expert, informal and cheap. The second is the report\nof the Committee constituted to undertake the review of delivery\nof justice through Tribunals, with Sir Andrew Leggatt as\nChairman. The Leggatt Committee submitted its report to the\nLord High Chancellor of Great Britain in March, 2001. The\nCommittee explained the advantages of Tribunals, provided\nthey could function independently and coherently, thus:\nB\nC\nD\n\"Choosing a tribunal to decide disputes should bring two\ndistinctive advantages for users. First, tribunal decisions\nare often made jointly by a panel of people who pool legal\nand other expert knowledge, and are the better for that E\nrange of skills. Secondly, tribunals' procedures and\napproach to overseeing the preparation of cases and their\nhearing can be simpler and more informal than the courts,\neven after the civil justice reforms. Most users ought\ntherefore to be capable of preparing and presenting their F\ncases to the tribunal themselves, providing they have the\nright kind of help. Enabling that kind of direct participation\nis an important jurisdiction for establishing tribunals at all.\nXXXXX\nDe Smith's Judicial Review, (6th Edn., Page 50 Para G\n1.085) sets out the advantages of Tribunals thus:\n\"In the design of an administrative justice system, a Tribunal\nmay be preferred to an ordinary court because its\nmembers have specialized knowledge of the subject- H\nA\nB\nс\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n916 SUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2010] 6 S.C.R.\nmatter, because it will be more informal in its trappings and\nprocedure, because it may be better at finding facts,\napplying flexible standards and exercising discretionary\npowers, and because it may be cheaper, more accessible\nand more expeditious than the High Court. Many of the\ndecisions given to Tribunals concern the merits of cases\nwith relatively little legal content, and in such cases a\nTribunal, usually consisting of a legally qualified Tribunal\njudge and two lay members, may be preferred to a court.\nIndeed dissatisfaction with the over-technical and allegedly\nunsympathetic approach of the courts towards social\nwelfare legislation led to a transfer of functions to special\nTribunals; the Workmen's Compensation Acts were\nadministered by the ordinary courts, but the National\nInsurance (Industrial Injuries) scheme was applied by\nTribunals. It is, however, unrealistic to imagine that\ntechnicalities and difficult legal issues can somehow be\navoided by entrusting the administration of complex\nlegislation to Tribunals rather than the courts.\"\n(emphasis supplied)\nH. W. R. Wade \u0026 C. F. Forsyth also refer to the advantage of\nTribunals in their 'Administrative Law' (10th Edn., pp.773-774):\n\"The social legislation of the twentieth century demanded\nTribunals for purely administrative reasons: they could offer\nspeedier, cheaper and more accessible justice, essential\nfor the administration of welfare schemes involving large\nnumbers of small claims. The process of the courts of law\nis elaborate, slow and costly. Its defects are those of its\nmerits, for the object is to provide the highest standard of\njustice; generally speaking, the public wants the best\npossible article, and is prepared to pay for it. But in\nadministering social services the aim is different. The\nobject is not the best article at any price but the best article.\nthat is consistent with efficient administration. Disputes\nmust be disposed of quickly and cheaply, for the benefit\n"}
