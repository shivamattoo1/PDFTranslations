It appears that as a matter of law, an inter-parte\nsuit simply for interim relief pending arbitrations, even if\nit be limited for the purpose of restraining dissipation of\nassets would not be maintainable. There would be\nnumber of hurdles which the plaintiff would have to\ncross, which may well prove to be insurmountable.\nPendency of the arbitration proceedings outside India C\nwould not provide a cause of action for a suit where the\nmain prayer is for injunction. It is patent that there is no\nexisting provision under the CPC or under the Arbitration\nAct, 1996 for a Court to grant interim measures in terms\nof Section 9, in arbitrations which take place outside D\nIndia, even though the parties by agreement may have\nmade the Arbitration Act, 1996 as the governing law of\narbitration.

Beuhaus\nreferred to.\nCONCLUSION :-\n-\nD\nE\nLL\nF\n2.1. The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 has\naccepted the territoriality principle which has been\nadopted in the UNCITRAL Model Law. Section 2(2) makes G\na declaration that Part I of the Arbitration Act, 1996 shall\napply to all arbitrations which take place within India. Part\nI of the Arbitration Act, 1996 would have no application\nto International Commercial Arbitration held outside\nIndia. Therefore, such awards would only be subject to H\n340 SUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2012] 12 S.C.R.\nA the jurisdiction of the Indian courts when the same are\nsought to be enforced in India in accordance with the\nprovisions contained in Part II of the Arbitration Act, 1996.\nThe provisions contained in Arbitration Act, 1996 make\nit crystal clear that there can be no overlapping or\nB Intermingling of the provisions contained in Part I with the\nprovisions contained in Part II of the Arbitration Act, 1996.\n[Para 198] [461-F-H; 462-A]\nC\n2.2. The provision contained in Section 2(2) of the\nArbitration Act, 1996 is not in conflict with any of the\nprovisions either in Part I or in Part II of the Arbitration\nAct, 1996. In a foreign seated international commercial\narbitration, no application for interim relief would be\nmaintainable under Section 9 or any other provision, as\napplicability of Part I of the Arbitration Act, 1996 is limited\nD to all arbitrations which take place in India. Similarly, no\nsuit for interim injunction simplicitor would be\nmaintainable in India, on the basis of an international\ncommercial arbitration with a seat outside India. [Para\n199] [462-B-D]\nE\nF\n2.3. Part of the Arbitration Act, 1996 is applicable\nonly to all the arbitrations which take place within the\nterritory of India. In order to do complete justice, it is\nhereby ordered, that the law now declared by this Court\nshall apply prospectively, to all the arbitration agreements\nexecuted hereafter.

Whilst hearing C.A.\nNo. 7019 of 2005, a two Judge Bench of this Court, on 16th\nJanuary, 2008, passed the following order:-\n\"In the midst of hearing of these appeals, learned counsel\nfor the appellant has referred to the three-Judges Bench\ndecision of this Court in Bhatia International Vs. Bulk\nTrading S.A. \u0026 Anr., (2002) 4 SCC 105. The said decision\nwas followed in a recent decision of two Judges Bench in\nVenture Global Engineering Vs. Satyam Computer\nServices Ltd. \u0026 Anr. 2008 (1) Scale 214. My learned\nbrother Hon'ble Mr. Justice Markandey Katju has\nreservation on the correctness of the said decisions in\nview of the interpretation of Clause (2) of Section 2 of the\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. My view is\notherwise.\nBHARAT ALUMINIUM CO. v. KAISER ALUMINIUM TECHNICAL 345\nSERVICE, INC. [SURINDER SINGH NIJJAR, J.]\nPlace these appeals before Hon'ble CJI for listing them\nbefore any other Bench.\"\n2. Pursuant to the aforesaid order, the appeal was placed\nfor hearing before a three Judge Bench, which by its order\ndated 1st November, 2011 directed the matters to be placed\nbefore the Constitution Bench on 10th January, 2012.\n3. Since the issue raised in the reference is pristinely legal,\nit is not necessary to make any detailed reference to the facts\nof the appeal. We may, however, notice the very essential facts\nleading to the filing of the appeal. An agreement dated 22nd\nApril, 1993 was executed between the appellant and the\nrespondent, under which the respondent was to supply and\ninstall a computer based system for Shelter Modernization at\nBalco's Korba Shelter. The agreement contained an arbitration\nclause for resolution of disputes arising out of the contract. The\narbitration clause contained in Articles 17 and 22 was as under:\n\"Article 17.1 - Any dispute or claim arising out of or relating\nto this Agreement shall be in the first instance, endeavour\nto be settled amicably by negotiation between the parties\nhereto and failing which the same will be settled by\narbitration pursuant to the English Arbitration Law and\nsubsequent amendments thereto.\nArticle 17.2 - The arbitration proceedings shall be carried\nout by two Arbitrators one appointed by BALCO and one\nby KATSI chosen freely and without any bias. The court of\nArbitration shall be held wholly in London, England and\nshall use English language in the proceeding. The findings\nand award of the Court of Arbitration shall be final and\nbinding upon the parties.\nArticle 22 - Governing Law - This agreement will be\ngoverned by the prevailing law of India and in case of\nArbitration, the English law shall apply.\"\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nA\n346\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2012] 12 S.C.R.\n4. The aforesaid clause itself indicates that by reason of\nthe agreement between the parties, the governing law of the\nagreement was the prevailing law of India. However, the\nsettlement procedure for adjudication of rights or obligations\nunder the agreement was by way of arbitration in London and\nB the English Arbitration Law was made applicable to such\nproceedings. Therefore, the lex fori for the arbitration is English\nLaw but the substantive law will be Indian Law.\nC\nD\n5. Disputes arose between the parties with regard to the\nperformance of the agreement. Claim was made by the\nappellant for return of its investment in the modernization\nprogramme, loss, profits and other sums. The respondent made\na claim for unclaimed instalments plus interest and damages\nfor breach of intellectual property rights. Negotiations to reach\na settlement of the disputes between the parties were\nunsuccessful and a written notice of request for arbitration was\nissued by the respondent to the appellant by a notice dated 13th\nNovember, 1997. The disputes were duly referred to arbitration\nwhich was held in England. The arbitral tribunal made two\nawards dated 10th November, 2002 and 12th November, 2002\nE in England. The appellant thereafter filed applications under\nSection 34 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 for setting aside the\naforesaid two awards in the Court of the learned District Judge,\nBilaspur which were numbered as MJC Nos. 92 of 2003 and\n14 of 2003, respectively. By an order dated 20th July, 2004,\nF the learned District Judge, Bilaspur held that the applications\nfiled by the appellant under Section 34 of the Arbitration and\nConciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as the\n‘Arbitration Act, 1996') for setting aside the foreign awards are\nnot tenable and accordingly dismissed the same.\nG\nH\n6. Aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment, the appellant filed\ntwo miscellaneous appeals being Misc. Appeal Nos. 889 of\n2004 and Misc. Appeal No.890 of 2004 in the High Court of\nJudicature at Chattisgarh, Bilaspur. By an order dated 10th\nAugust, 2005, a Division Bench of the High Court dismissed\nthe appeal. It was held as follows:\n"}
