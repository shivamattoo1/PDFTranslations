Mr. Harish N.

SINHA, J.]\n3)\n4)\ngenerating station to a consumer, it, while directing A\nthe MPPs to supply electrical energy to APTRANSCO\nhad the requisite power to direct the APTRANSCO\nto purchase the same.\nB\nIn any event the APTRANSCO itself having invited\nthe order and furthermore having suffered two\ndirections of the Commission as contained in its\norders dated 18th August, 2001 and 26th November,\n2001 whereby and whereunder the Commission\ndirected the APT to purchase electrical energy from\nthe company subject to fixation of rate by C\nnegotiations, and in the event of failure, to come back\nto the Commission cannot now turn round and\nquestion its jurisdiction to do so and, thus the High\nCourt was within its jurisdiction to issue the directions.\nAPTRANSCO had been changing its stand from\nstage to stage, in so far as at one point of time it\ncomplained of the capital costs being too high; when\nthe company came down to fix costs, it did not accept\nthe same and asked for the factor of variable costs\nfor the purpose of fixation of tariff and when the\ncompany, as an act of desperation, keeping in view\nits commitments to various financial institution, had\neven agreed therefor, took a complete turn about to\ncontend that they do not require the power.\n5) The Government of Andhra Pradesh having referred\nthe matter to Central Electricity Authority for its opinion\nand having obtained the same, the Commission was\nbound to compel APTRANSCO to agree thereto.\n6)\nD\nE\nF\nIn any event, as by reason of the stand taken by G\nAPTRANSCO, the company had to cancel all the\nagreements of supply entered into by and between\nthe parties for supply of electrical energy, it could not\nhave resciled from its representation and refused to\npurchase electrical energy from it.\nH\nF\nA\nB\n—Å\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n616\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n7)\n8)\n[2008] 9 S.C.R.\nOnce it is contended by the APTRANSCO that the\nCommission had the power to direct the MMPs to\nsell their produce only to it, as a matter of policy,\ncould not have contended that the Commission can\nhave only half a power and it had no power to ask it\nto purchase the same.\nThe Commission which itself has made a mess of\neverything, was bound as an expert body to take the\ninterim direction of the Commission to its logical\nconclusion.\n9) The State having the power to lay down the policy\ndecision in terms of Section 12 of the 1998 Act, the\nCommission is bound to give effect thereto having\nregard to its functions as envisaged in Section 11(1)(f)\nof the Act. It was, thus, bound to promote\ncompetitiveness involving participation of private\nsector progressively and not regressively.\n11) APTRANSCO having been constituted under the Act\nand its functions being subject to supervision by the\nCommission, was bound to obey the directions of\nthe Commission.\n7. Mr. Narsimhan and Mr. Dushyant Dave, learned senior\ncounsel appearing on behalf of G.V.K. and Astha Power sub-\nmitted that having regard to the fact that the MPPs had been\ngranted licences by the State in terms of Section 28 of 1910\nAct and Section 43A (1)(c) of 1948 Act the provisions of the\n1998 Act as regards grant of licences would not be applicable\nin their cases.\nThe learned counsel submitted that the Commission had\nno jurisdiction to ignore the policy decision of the State, particu-\nlarly when the consumers to whom the MPPs would supply\npower upon generation thereof had been fixed. Such a policy\ndecision, in view of Section 12 of the Act was binding on the\nCommission. Respondents were ill advised to approach the\nA.P. ELECTRICITY REGULATORY COMMISSION V. 617\nM/S. R.V.K. ENERGY PVT. LTD. [S.B. SINHA, J.]\nCommission for grant of exemption which was not necessary A\nas has been found by the High Court. The Commission in any\nevent had no jurisdiction to direct sale of electricity only to\nAPTRANSCO. The power to regulate sale and supply of elec-\ntrical energy as contained in Section 11 of the 1998 Act must\nbe held to be subject to other provisions of the Act and in par- B\nticular Sections 15(1)(h) and 15(1(k) and Section 17 thereof.\n8. The permission granted in terms of Section 43A of 1948\nAct having been repealed by 1998 Act, the Central Government\nhad recognized the same by introducing the Electricity (Removal\nof Difficulties) Second Order, 2005 in the light of Section 10(2) C\nof the Electricity Act, 2003 The sanction and permission granted\nby the State, which was the only competent authority therefor,\nhaving conferred a benefit upon the MPPs by granting licences,\nas a result whereof the legal rights vested in them, the same\ncould not have been taken away.\n9. While issuing a direction that MPPs must sell the elec-\ntricity only to APTRANSCO the Commission had not only failed\nto address the question raised before., it passed an order only\non the basis of misplaced conception.\nD\nE\n10. The State took a policy decision. It was with a view to\ndevelop growth of generation and supply of electrical energy.\nMonopoly of the State Electricity Board was sought to be given\na go bye. The intention of the State to lay down the policy deci-\nsion in regard to privatization of generation and supply of elec- F\ntrical energy is manifest from the GOMs. issued by it.\n11. There is absolutely no doubt whatsoever that the Com-\nmission, which is a statutory authority, is bound by the direction\nof the State but it would not be so bound if it is contrary to or\ninconsistent with any of the provisions contained in 1998 Act. G\nRespondents herein sought for an exemption from the provisions\nthereof. They filed applications in terms of Section 16 of 1998\nAct. Whether such an application was filed on a mistaken belief\nor not is one question but the action taken by the Commission\nmust be construed upon taking a holistic view of the matter.\nH\n618\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n1\n[2008] 9 S.C.R.\nA\n12. Respondents herein acted pursuant to the promise\nmade by the State. They altered their position. They have in-\nvested a huge amount. They secured foreign collaboration,\nraised huge loans from financial institutions. They not only en-\ntered into Power Purchase Agreements but also entered into\nB Power Wheeling Agreements with APTRANSCO. The said ar-\nrangements were entered into in view of the fact that the private\ngenerating companies did not have the requisite infrastructure\nfor transmission of electrical energy from their generating sta-\ntions to the consumers.\nC\n13. It was in the aforementioned background, we must take\ninto account that the applications for exemptions were filed pur-\nsuant to the order passed by the Commission as indicated here-\ninbefore. It was the Commission which opined that such an ap-\nplication for exemption was not required to be filed. However,\nD while dealing with the application, Commission issued a direc-\ntion that the power generated by MPPs must be sold to\nAPTRANSCO only and the sale to the 3rd party was prohibited.\nDirection was issued in this behalf in great details. The said\ndirection was the subject matter of appeal before the Andhra\nE Pradesh High Court.\nF\nG\n14. Indisputably the letter dated 29th February, 1996 is-\nsued by the State to the private entrepreneurs is also in conso-\nnance with the said objective.\nThe power of the Commission in terms of 1998 Act must\nbe considered having regard to the provisions of Section 11\nthereof. We may at the outset notice two different functions speci-\nfied under the Act. Section 11 of 1998 states about the func-\ntions of the Commission whereas Section 12 thereof states\nabout the powers of the State Government.\nNo doubt the functions of the Commission is wide. It, in\nterms of clause (e) of sub-section (1) of Section 11 of the 1998,\nis entitled to regulate the purchase, distribution and supply as\nalso utilization of electricity but when the Act speaks of regula-\nH tion, the same would not ordinarily mean that it can totally pro-\n"}
