VITTAL RAO AND ORS.\nA\nFEBRUARY 2, 2006\nB\n[S.B. SINHA AND P.K. BALASUBRAMANYAN, JJ.]\nService Law:\nOvertime allowance to Train Superintendents-Issuance of a Circular\nplacing them in supervisory category thereby disentitling them to draw C\novertime allowance-Withdrawal of Circular-Claim of arrear for intervening\nperiod-Held: Circular/Notification not prospective in effect-Since the\nCircular/Notification withdrawn and status-quo ante was restored, the\nincumbent would be deemed to have been continuing in the non-supervisory\ncapacity only-Hence, they are entitled to claim the overtime allowance for D\nthe intervening period.\nRespondents, working as Train Superintendents in the Railway, were\nentitled to draw overtime allowance. Later, in terms of the Circular dated\n2.8.84 they were placed in the supervisory category, thereby, they became\ndisentitled to draw overtime allowance. However, the said Circular was later E\nwithdrawn by the Railway Board. Respondents claimed for the arrears for\nthe intervening period, which was rejected by the authorities. They filed a\npetition before the Central Administrative Tribunal. The Tribunal allowed the\npetition holding that they were entitled to overtime allowance. The writ petition\nfiled by the appellants questioning the correctness or otherwise of the said\njudgment of the Tribunal was dismissed by the High Court. Hence the present\nappeal.\nF\nAppellants contended that the circular dated 11.4.2001 withdrawing the\nearlier Circular conferring supervisory status on the respondents did not\nhave retrospective effect or retroactive operation and in that view of the matter, G\nthe Tribunal and consequently the High Court, committed a serious error in\ndirecting payment of overtime allowance in favour of the respondents for the\nintervening period; and that the petition was barred by limitation.\nRespondents submitted that since the circular dated 2.8.1984 was\n1097\nH\n1098\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\nA withdrawn, they became entitled to overtime allowance.\nDismissing the appeal, the Court\n[2006] 1 S.C.R.\nHELD.1.1. Overtime allowance ceased to become payable to the\nrespondents only when they were placed in the supervisory category. By reason\nB of the notification dated 11.4.2001, the status quo ante as was obtaining on\n2.8.1984 was restored as a result whereof the respondents would be deemed\nto have been continuing to remain in the non-supervisory category only. It is\nfurthermore clear in terms of the circular letter issued by the Railway Board\nitself that till an appropriate decision is taken, for the intervening period i.e\nfrom 2.8.1984 to 11.4.2001the practice would remain effective. As the practice\nC\nremained effective, the respondents continued to be in the non-supervisory\ncategory and in that view of the matter they had rightly been held to be entitled\nto the overtime allowance. [1100-F, G]\n1.2. The Circular letter dated 11.4.2001 does not state that it is\nD prospective in nature. It does not further more state that overtime allowance\nwould be payable to the respondents only after the issuance thereof. The\nearlier circular dated 2.8.1984 having been withdrawn, the effect of circular\ndated 2.8.1984 shall stand effaced. Furthermore, from a letter dated 20.9.2001\nissued by the appellant, it appears that the circular letter dated 11.4.2001\nwas also understood in the same manner as was done by the respondents\nE inasmuch as therein it was stated that the Train Superintendents for the extra\nwork beyond rostered hours would be eligible for overtime allowance as they\nshould be treated under non-supervisory post.

Leave granted.\nA\n.?\nThis appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 15.3.2005\npassed by the High Court of Andhra Pradesh in Writ Petition No. 1625 of 2004\nwhereby and whereunder the writ petition filed by the appellant herein\nquestioning the correctness of the judgment and order dated 3.10.2003 passed\nby the Central Administrative Tribunal in O.A. No. 13/2003 was dismissed. B\nThe basic fact of the matter is not in dispute. The respondents herein\nat all material times were and still are working as Train Superintendents.\nAdmittedly prior to 2.8.1984 they were placed in the non-supervisory category.\nThe Railway Board issued a circular on 2.8.1984 in terms whereof they were\nplaced in the supervisory category.\nC\nIndisputably, prior to 2.8.1984 those who were to work beyond rostered\nhours were entitled to draw overtime allowance. As by reason of the\naforementioned circular dated 2.8.84 the respondents were placed in the\nsupervisory category, they became disentitled to draw overtime allowance. D\nThe said circular letter however, was withdrawn by the Railway Board on or\nabout 11.4.2001, inter alia, stating:\n\"Pending question of classification of Train Superintendents on trains\nother than Rajdhani Express being discussed further with the\nFederations, the matter has been carefully considered by Board and E\nit has been decided as under:\n(i) Instructions contained in Board's letter No. E(LL)/79/HER/1-13,\ndated 2.8.84 are withdrawn with immediate effect.\n(ii) For the intervening period from 2.8.84 till 11.4.2001 (i.e., the date\nof issue of this letter), the practice followed on each individual railway\nin regard to classification of Train Superintendents on trains other\nthan Rajdhani Express as Superivisory or non-supervisory shall remain\neffective.\n(iii) The matter regarding classification as 'Supervisory' of Train\nSuperintendents on trains other than Rajdhani Express shall be finalized\nexpeditiously in consultation with the two recognized staff\nFederations.\"\nF\nG\nThe respondents in view of the aforementioned circular letter dated\n11.4.2001 filed an original application before the Central Administrative Tribunal H\n1100\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2006] 1 S.C.R.\nA which was marked as O.A. No. 13/03. The Tribunal arrived at a finding of fact\nthat whereas rostered hours of duty of the respondents were 108 hours every\nfortnight, the respondents having worked for 205 hours are entitled to 97\nhours' over time allowance every fortnight The writ petition filed by the\nappellants herein questioning the correctness or otherwise of the said judgment\nof the Tribunal was dismissed.\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nMr. A. Sharan, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant\nsubmitted that the said circular dated 11.4.2001 did not have retrospective\neffect or retroactive operation and in that view of the matter, the Tribunal and\nconsequently the High Court, committed a serious error in directing payment\nof overtime allowance in favour of the respondents for the period from\n2.8.1984 to 11.4.2001. In any view of the matter, the learned counsel contended\nthat the original application was barred by limitation. Our attention has further\nbeen drawn to the fact that the respondents did not deny or dispute that they\nhad drawn the over time allowance from the date of the clarification issued\nby the Railway Board.\nMr. C.S.N. Mohan Rao, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the\nrespondents, on the other hand, submitted that as by reason of the\naforementioned circular dated 11.4.2001 the earlier circular dated 2.8.1984 was\nwithdrawn, the respondents became entitled to over time allowance.\nA bare perusal of the circular dated 11.4.2001 clearly demonstrates that\nthereby the earlier circular letter dated 2.8.1984 stood withdrawn. It is not\ndenied or disputed that the practice prevailing in the Division was that apart\nfrom Train Superintendents of Rajdhani Express, others were entitled to overtime\nallowance. Overtime allowance ceased to become payable to the respondents\nonly when they were placed in the supervisory category. By reason of the\nsaid notification dated 11.4.2001 indisputably, the status quo ante as was\nobtaining on 2.8.1984 was restored as a result whereof the respondents would\nbe deemed to have been continuing to remain in the non-supervisory category\nonly. It is furthermore clear in terms of the circular letter issued by the Railway\nBoard itself that till an appropriate decision is taken, for the intervening period\nGi.e. from 2.8.1984 to 11.4.2001 the practice would remain effective. As the\npractice remained effective, the respondents continued to be in the non-\nsupervisory category and in that view of the matter they had rightly been held\nto be entitled to the overtime allowance. Circular letter dated 11.4.2001 does\nnot state that it is prospective in nature. It does not further more state that\novertime allowance would be payable to the respondents only after the\nH\nA\n+\nCHAIRMAN RAILWAY BOARD v. T. VITTAL RAO [SINHA, J.] 1101\nissuance thereof. The earlier circular dated 2.8.1984 having been withdrawn, A\nthe effect of circular dated 2.8.1984 shall stand effaced. Furthermore, from a\nletter dated 20.9.2001 issued by the Division Railway Manager (P) SC to the\nSr. DCM/SC, it appears, that the circular letter dated 11.4.2001 was also\nunderstood in the same manner as was done by the respondents inasmuch\nas therein it was stated that the Train Superintendents for the extra work\nbeyond rostered hours would be eligible for overtime allowance as they\nshould be treated under non-supervisory post.\nP. Mahendran \u0026 Ors. v. State of Karnataka, [1990] 1 SCC 411 relied\nupon by the learned counsel for the appellants is of no assistance in the\ninstant case. The question which arose for consideration therein was as to\nwhether the qualification contained in the amended rules should be given\nretrospective effect or whether the rules being prospective in nature, the right\nof the candidates cannot be taken away.\nB\nC\nN.T. Devin Katti \u0026 Ors. v. Karnataka Public Service Commission \u0026\nOrs. [1990] 3 SCC 157 is an authority for the proposition that the changes in D\nthe reservation policy cannot be effected retrospectively so as to affect the\ncandidates' existing right in terms of the advertisement for selection which\nhad been issued much prior to the change in policy.\nFor the foregoing reasons we do not find any merit in this appeal and\nit is accordingly dismissed. In the facts and circumstances of the case, the E\nparties shall bear their own costs.\nS.K.S.\nAppeal dismissed.\n"}
