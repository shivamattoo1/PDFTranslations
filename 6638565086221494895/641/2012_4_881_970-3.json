In exercise of the power vested in it under Section 4- G\nA(1) of the Town Planning Act, the State Government issued\nNotifications dated 1.11.1965 and 13.3.1984 declaring the\nareas specified therein to be the “Local Planning Areas\". By\nthe first notification, the State Government declared the area\ncomprising the city of Bangalore and 218 villages enumerated H\n916 SUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2012] 4 S.C.R.\nA in Schedule I thereto to be the “Local Planning Area\" for the\npurposes of the Town Planning Act and described it as the\nBangalore City Planning Area. The limits of the planning area\nwere described in Schedule II appended to the notification. By\nthe second notification, the area comprising 325 villages around\nB Bangalore (as mentioned in Schedule I) was declared to be the\nLocal Planning Area for the environs of Bangalore. The limits\nof the city planning area were indicated in Schedule II. At the\nend of Schedule II of the second notification, the following note\nwas added:\nC\n\"This excludes the Bangalore City Local Planning Area\ndeclared (by) Government Notification No. PLN/42/MNP/\n65/SO/3446 dated 1-11-1965.\"\n8. A third notification was issued on 6.4.1984 under\nD Section 4-A(3) of the Town Planning Act amalgamating the\nLocal Planning Areas of Bangalore declared under the earlier\ntwo notifications as \"Bangalore City Planning Area\" w.e.f.\n1.4.1984.\nE\nF\nG\n9. On 1.3.1988, the State Government issued notification\nunder Section 2(c) of the 1976 Act specifying the villages.\nindicated in the first Schedule and within the boundaries\nindicated in the second Schedule to Notification dated\n13.3.1984 to be the areas for the purposes of that clause. We\nshall refer to this notification a little later in the context of the\nHigh Court's negation of the respondents' challenge to that\nnotification on the ground that the names of the villages or\nspecified areas had not been published in the Official Gazette\nand, as such, the layout plans of the area comprised in those\nvillages are not governed by the 1976 Act.\n10. As a result of unprecedented increase in the population\nof the city of Bangalore between 1970 and 1980, the available\ncivic amenities like roads, water supply system and supply of\nelectricity were stretched to their limit. To meet the additional\nH requirement of water and electricity and to tackle the problems\nBANGALORE DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY v. AIR CRAFT 917\nEMPLOYEES COOP. SOCIETY LTD. [G.S. SINGHVI, J.]\nof traffic, new schemes were prepared in the development plan A\nof Bangalore city, which was approved in 1984. These included\naugmentation of water supply, formation of Ring Road etc.\nBangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB)\nsubmitted a proposal to the State Government for taking up of\nCauvery Water Supply Scheme, Stage III (for short, 'the Cauvery B\nScheme') for supply of an additional 270 MLD water to\nBangalore at a cost of Rs. 240 crores. The proposed financing\npattern of the project was as follows:\n(i)\nState Government\n-\nRs.80/- crores,\n(ii)\nLife Insurance\nCorporation of India\nRs. 50/- crores,\n(iii) Bangalore City Corporation -\nRs. 30/- crores, and\nRs. 80/- crores.\n(iv) World Bank\n11. By an order dated 28.06.1984, the State Government,\nafter taking cognizance of the difficulties being experienced by\nBWSSB in supplying water to the Bangalore Metropolitan Area\nand the possibility of acute shortage of water in next 10 years\nif the supply was not augmented, granted approval to the\nCauvery Scheme.\nD\nE\n12. Since the World Bank assistance was expected only\nin the year 1988 and the Cauvery Scheme was to be\nF\nimplemented by 1990 to meet the drinking water needs of the\nresidents of Bangalore, the issue was discussed in the meeting\nheld on 01.01.1987 under the chairmanship of the Chief\nSecretary of the State and it was decided that with a view to\navoid escalation in the cost, the funds may be collected from\nother sources including the BDA because substantial quantity\nof water was required for the layouts which were being\ndeveloped by it or likely to be developed in future. In furtherance\nof that decision, the State Government issued order dated\n25.03.1987 and directed the BDA to make a grant of Rs. 30\ncrores to BWSSB to be paid in installments from 1987-88 to\nG\nH\n918 SUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2012] 4 S.C.R.\nA 1989-90 by loading an extra amount as water supply\ncomponent at the rate of Rs. 10,000/- on an average per site\nfor all the layouts to be formed thereafter.\nB\nC\nD\nF\n13. In compliance of the directions given by the State\nGovernment, the BDA started collecting Rs.10,000/- per site.\nLater on, the levy under the Cauvery Scheme was increased\nto Rs.1 lac per acre. By 1992, it was realised that the BDA had\nnot been able to develop and distribute sites as expected.\nTherefore, a proposal was submitted by the Commissioner,\nBDA to the State Government that contribution towards the\nCauvery Scheme may be distributed among those applying for\nchange of land use and the private layouts to be developed by\nthe house building societies and on major housing projects. The\nState Government accepted the suggestion of the BDA and\npassed order dated 12.1.1993 for the levy of charges under\nthe Cauvery Scheme at the rate of Rs.2 lacs per acre.\n14. In 1992, the BDA also decided to take up the\nconstruction of 63.30 kilometers long Outer Ring Road and 3.5\nkilometers long Intermediate Ring Road at an estimated cost\nE of Rs.115 crores with a possible escalation up to Rs.130\ncrores. 36.24 kilometers of the Outer Ring Road was to pass\nthrough the BDA layouts and the balance was to pass through\nthe land outside the BDA layouts. The cost of construction of\nOuter Ring Road passing through the BDA layout was to be\nmet by charging the allottees of sites in the BDA layouts. For\nthe balance 27.06 kilometers of Outer Ring Road and 3.5\nkilometers of Intermediate Ring Road a proposal was prepared\nto obtain financial assistance from the World Bank. In the\nmeeting held on 5.6.1992 under the chairmanship of the Chief\nSecretary of the State, the possibility of taking loan from\nHUDCO was explored. Simultaneously, it was considered\nwhether partial burden of the cost could be passed on to the\nbeneficiaries of the private layouts and it was agreed that like\nthe Cauvery Scheme, Ring Road surcharge should be levied\non the sites to be formed by the BDA and the private housing\nG\nH\nBANGALORE DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY v. AIR CRAFT 919\nEMPLOYEES COOP. SOCIETY LTD. [G.S. SINGHVI, J.]\nsocieties at the rate of Rs.1 lac per acre. Thereafter, the BDA A\npassed Resolution dated 19.10.1992 for levy of charges at\ndifferent rates on change of land use in different areas and Rs.1\nlac per acre on the layouts of housing societies and private\nlands as also the sites formed by itself.\n15. The Air Craft Employees Cooperative Society Ltd.\n(respondent in C.A. No.7503/2002) submitted an application\nfor approval of layout in respect of 324 acres 30 guntas land\nsituated in Singasandra and Kudlu villages, Surjapur Hobli and\nBegur Hobli respectively. The application of the respondent was\nconsidered in the BDA's meeting held on 31.10.1991 and was\napproved subject to various conditions including payment of\nRs.2 lacs per acre towards the Cauvery Scheme and Rs.1 lac\nas Ring Road surcharge. Another condition incorporated in the\nResolution of the BDA was that the civil portion of work shall\nbe carried out by the respondent under its supervision. The\ndecision of the BDA was communicated to the respondent vide\nletter dated 12.11.1992.\nB\nC\nD\n16. The respondent challenged the conditional sanction of\nits layout in Writ Petition No.11144/1993 and prayed for E\nquashing the demand of Rs.2 lacs per acre towards the\nCauvery Scheme and Rs.1 lac as Ring Road surcharge by\nmaking the following assertions:\n(i) The order passed by the State Government was\napplicable only to the sites to be formed by the BDA and not\nthe layout of private House Building Societies because as per\nthe Chairman of BWSSB, it will not be possible to take up the\nresponsibility of providing water supply and underground\ndrainage to such layouts and the societies had to make their\nown arrangements.\n(ii) The Cauvery Scheme will be able to meet the\nrequirements of only the citizens residing within the municipal\narea and some newly formed layouts adjacent to the city.\nF\nG\nI\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\n920\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2012] 4 S.C.R.\n(iii) There is no provision in the Bangalore Water Supply\nand Sewerage Act, 1964 (for short, 'the 1964 Act') under which\nthe burden of capital required for the execution of schemes\ncould be passed on to the private House Building Societies and,\nin any case, the BWSSB can recover the cost by resorting to\nSection 16 of the 1964 Act.\n(iv) Under the 1976 Act, the Government is not empowered\nto authorise the BDA to transfer the cost of the Cauvery\nScheme to the private layouts.\n(v) 20,000 acres of land has been acquired by the BDA\nfor forming layouts in the vicinity of Bangalore and 10,000 acres\nhad been acquired by the Government for House Building\nCooperative Societies and if Rs.1 or 2 lacs per acre are\ncharged, the Government will collect about Rs.600 crores from\nthe BDA itself, though the latter's contribution was initially fixed\nat Rs.30 crores only.\n(vi) The demand of Rs.1 or 2 lacs per acre towards the\nCauvery Scheme is ultra vires the provisions of Article 265 of\nthe Constitution.\n(vii) The levy of Rs.1 lac per acre as Ring Road surcharge\nis not sanctioned by law and the State and the BDA cannot\nburden the private layouts without determining whether the Ring\nRoad would be of any use to the members of the House\nF Building Societies.\nG\nH\n17. During the pendency of Writ Petition No.11144/1993,\nthe State legislature amended the 1976 Act by Act. No.17/1994\nand inserted sub-section (5A) in Section 32 w.e.f. 20.6.1987\nauthorising the BDA to demand sums in addition to those\nreferred in sub-section (5) to meet the expenditure towards the\nexecution of any scheme or work for augmenting water supply,\nelectricity, roads, transportation and other amenities within the\nBangalore Metropolitan area.\n"}
