Against the acquittal,\nthe State Government in terms of Section 378(3) CrPC filed application\nE for grant of leave to appeal before the High Court. Since there was delay\nof 57 days in making the application, an application for condonation of\ndelay was also filed under Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963. High\nCourt, however, refused to condone the delay on grounds that it was the\nduty of the litigant to file appeal before expiry of the limitation period;\nthat merely because the Additional Advocate General did not file an appeal\ninspite of the instructions issued to him, that did not constitute sufficient\ncause and further the fact that the records were purportedly missing was\nnot a valid ground. Accordingly the application for condonation of delay\nand consequentially the application for grant of leave to appeal was\nrejected. Hence the present appeal.\nF\nG\nH\nAllowing the appeal, the Court\nHELD: 1.1. The proof by sufficient cause is a condition precedent\nfor exercise of the extraordinary restriction vested in the court.

The expression \"sufficient cause\" should be considered with\npragmatism in justice-oriented approach rather than the technical\ndetection of sufficient cause for explaining every day's delay. [116-E]\nB\nC\nD\n2.1. Considerable delay of procedural re-tape in the process of\ndecision making by the Government is a common feature. Therefore,\ncertain amount of latitude is not impermissible. If the appeals brought by\nthe State are lost for such default no person is individually affected but\nwhat in the ultimate analysis suffers, is public interest. The court should\ndecide the matters on merits unless the case is hopelessly without merit. E\n[116-D-F]\n2.2. No separate standards to determine the cause laid by the State\nvis-a-vis private litigant could be laid to prove strict standards of sufficient\ncause. The Government at appropriate level should constitute legal cells\nto examine the cases whether any legal principles are involved for decision F\nby the courts or whether cases require adjustment and should authorize\nthe officers to take a decision or give appropriate permission for\nsettlement. In the event of decision to file appeal, needed prompt action\nshould be pursued by the officer responsible to file the appeal and he\nshould be made personally responsible for lapses, if any. Equally, the State G\ncannot be put on the same footing as an individual. The individual would\nalways be quick in taking the decision whether he would pursue the\nremedy by way of an appeal or application since he is a person legally\ninjured while State is an impersonal machinery working through its\nofficers or servants.

Leave granted.\nF\nThe State of Nagaland questions correctness of the judgment rendered\nby a learned Single Judge of the Gauhati High Court, Kohima Bench refusing\nto condone the delay by rejecting the application filed under Section 5 of the\nLimitation Act, 1963 (in short the 'Limitation Act') and consequentially\nG rejecting of application for grant of leave to appeal. Before we deal with the\nlegality of the order refusing to condone the delay in making the application\nfor grant of leave, a brief reference to the factual background would suffice\nApplication for grant of leave was made in terms of Section 378 (3) of\nthe Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (in short the ‘Code'). A judgment of\nH acquittal was passed by learned Additional Deputy Commissioner (Judicial)\nSTATE OF NAGALAND v. LIPOK AO [PASAYAT, J.] 111\nDimapur, Nagaland. The judgment was pronounced on 18.12.2002. As there A\nwas delay in making the application for grant of leave in terms of Section\n378(3) of the Code, application for condonation of delay was filed. As is\nrevealed from the application for condonation, copy of the order was received\nby the concerned department on 15th January, 2003; without wasting any\ntime on the same date the relevant documents and papers were put up for\nB\nnecessary action before the Deputy Inspector General of Police, (Head\nquarters), Nagaland. On the next day, the said Deputy Inspector General\nconsidered the matter and forwarded the file for consideration to the Deputy\nInspector General of Police (M\u0026P), Nagaland. Unfortunately the whole file\nalong with note sheet were found missing from the office and could not be\ntraced in spite of best efforts made by the department. Finally it was traced C\non 15.3.2003 and the file was put up for necessary action by the Additional\nDirector General of Police (Headquarter) Nagaland. The said officer opined\nthat an appeal was to be filed on 26.3.2003, and finally the appeal was filed\nafter appointing a special Public Prosecutor. When it was noticed that no\nappeal had been filed, the Secretary to the Department of Law and Justice,\nGovernment of Nagaland got in touch with the Additional General, Gauhati\nHigh Court regarding the filing of the appeal and in fact the appeal was filed\non 14.5.2003. It is of relevance to note that in the application for condonation\nof delay it was clearly noted that when directions were given to reconstruct\nthe file, missing file suddenly appeared in the office of Director General of\nPolice, Nagaland.\nE\nD\nF\nIn support of the application for condonation of delay, it was submitted\nthat the aspects highlighted clearly indicated that the authorities were acting\nbonafide and various decisions of this court were pressed into service to seek\ncondonation of delay. High Court, however, refused to condone the delay of\n57 days on the ground that it is the duty of the litigant to file an appeal before\nthe expiry of the limitation period. Merely because the Additional Advocate\nGeneral did not file an appeal in spite of the instructions issued to him, that\ndid not constitute sufficient cause and further the fact that the records were\npurportedly missing was not a valid ground. It was noted that merely asking\nthe Additional Advocate General to file an appeal was not sufficient and the G\ndepartment should have pursued the matter and should have made enquiries\nas to whether the appeal had in fact, been filed or not. Accordingly the\napplication for condonation of delay in filing the appeal was rejected and\nconsequentially the application for grant of leave was rejected.\nLearned counsel appearing for the appellant State submitted that the\nH\n1\n1\n112\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2005] 3 S.C.R.\nA approach of the High Court is not correct and in fact it is contrary to the\nposition of law indicated by this Court in various cases. In the application for\ncondonation of delay the various factors which were responsible for the\ndelayed filing were highlighted. There was no denial or dispute regarding the\ncorrectness of the assertions and, therefore, the refusal to condone the delay\nin filing application is not proper. It has to be noted that police officials were\ninvolved in the crime. The background facts involved also assume importance.\nAs the police officers attached to a Minister had allegedly killed two persons,\ntherefore, the mischief played by some persons interested to help the accused\ncolleagues could not have been lost sight of. There is no appearance on\nbehalf of the respondent in spite of the service of notice.\nB\nC\nAs noted above a brief reference to the factual aspect is necessary. The\nbackground facts of the prosecution version are as followed.\nOn 29th May, 1999 the five accused/respondents comprised the escort\nparty of a State Cabinet Minister. The case of the Accused/Respondents was\nD that at 5.30 p.m. on 29th May, 1999, the occupants of a Maruti Zen crossed\nE\nthe cavalcade of the Minister and shouted at them. The personal security\nofficer attached to the Minister saw one of the occupants of the car holding.\na small fire-arm. After dropping the Minister, the escort vehicle while\nproceeding to another place saw the Maruti Zen and its occupants, who on\nseeing the police party tried to escape. Meanwhile one of the occupants of\nthe case opened the rear glass and opened fire from his fire-arm. On hearing\ngun fire, the police party also opened fire but the Maruti Zen escaped and\ndisappeared. Subsequently, the car was discovered with one of its three\noccupants was found to be already dead and the other two had sustained\nbullet injuries. Of the two survivors one died subsequently in hospital and\nF another had to have his arm amputated.\nG\nThe said shoot out incident was investigated by the police and a case\nunder Sections 302/307/326/34 of Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short 'IPC')\nwas registered against the accused/respondents.\nThe trial court noted that the ballistic report established that the bullets\nwere fired from the guns of the accused-respondents. A finding was also\nrecorded that the respondent exceeded their power for opening fire, and this\nconstituted misfiescence, but absence of the post-mortem report was held to\nhave vitally affected prosecution case it was also held that the accused persons\nH had fired with AK 47 and M 22 rifles in self defence. Therefore, benefit of\n113\nSTATE OF NAGALAND v. LIPOK AO [PASAYAT. J.]\ndoubt was given to them. A pragmatic approach has to be adopted and when A\nsubstantial justice and technical approach were pilled against each other the\nformer has to be preferred.\nB\nThe proof by sufficient cause is a condition precedent for exercise of\nthe extraordinary restriction vested in the court. What counts is not the length\nof the delay but the sufficiency of the cause and shortness of the delay is one\nof the circumstances to be taken into account in using the discretion. In N.\nBalakrishnan v. M. Krishnamurthy, AIR (1998) SC 3222 it was held by this\nCourt that Section 5 is to be construed liberally so as to do substantial justice\nto the parties. The provision contemplates that the Court has to go in the\nposition of the person concerned and to find out if the delay can be said to C\nhave been resulted from the cause which he had adduced and whether the\ncause can be recorded in the peculiar circumstances of the case is sufficient.\nAlthough no special indulgence can be shown to the Government which, in\nsimilar circumstances, is not shown to an individual suitor, one cannot but\ntake a practical view of the working of the Government without being unduly\nindulgent to the slow motion of its wheels.\nD\nE\nWhat constitutes sufficient cause cannot be laid down by hard and fast\nrules. In New India Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Shanti Misra, [1975] 2 SCC 840\nthis Court held that discretion given by Section 5 should not be defined or\ncrystallised so as to convert a discretionary matter into a rigid rule of law.\nThe expression \"sufficient cause\" should receive a liberal construction. In\nBrij Indar Singh v. Kanshi Ram, ILR (1918) 45 Cal 94 (PC) it was observed\nthat true guide for a court to exercise the discretion under Section 5 is whether\nthe appellant acted with reasonable diligence in prosecuting the appeal. In\nShakuntala Devi Jain v. Kuntal Kumari, AIR (1969) SC 575 a Bench of three\nJudges had held that unless want of bona fides of such inaction or negligence F\nas would deprive a party of the protection of Section 5 is proved, the\napplication must not be thrown out or any delay cannot be refused to be\ncondoned.\nIn Concord of India Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Nirmala Devi, [1979] 4 SCC\n365 which is a case of negligence of the counsel which misled a litigant into G\ndelayed pursuit of his remedy, the default in delay was condoned. In Lala\nMatu Din v. A. Narayanan, [1969] 2 SCC 770, this Court had held that there\nis no general proposition that mistake of counsel by itself is always sufficient\ncause for condonation of delay. It is always a question whether the mistake\nwas hona fide or was merely a device to cover an ulterior purpose. In that\nH\n1\n1\n}\n114\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2005] 3 S.C.R.\nA case it was held that the mistake committed by the counsel was bona fide and\nit was not tainted by any mala fide motive.\nB\nC\nIn State of Kerala v. E. K. Kuriyipe, [1981] Supp SCC 72, it was held\nthat whether or not there is sufficient cause for condonation of delay is a\nquestion of fact dependant upon the facts and circumstances of the particular\ncase. In Milavi Devi v. Dina Nath, [1982] 3 SCC 366, it was held that the\nappellant had sufficient cause for not filing the appeal within the period of\nlimitation. This Court under Article 136 can reassess the ground and in\nappropriate case set aside the order made by the High Court or the Tribunal\nand remit the matter for hearing on merits. It was accordingly allowed, delay\nwas condoned and the case was remitted for decision on merits.\n-\nIn O.P. Kathpalia v. Lakhmir Singh, [1984] 4 SCC 66, a Bench of three\nJudges had held that if the refusal to condone the delay results in grave\nmiscarriage of justice, it would be a ground to condone the delay. Delay was\naccordingly condoned. In Collector Land Acquisition v. Katiji, [1987] 2 SCC\nD 107, a Bench of two Judges considered the question of the limitation in an\nappeal filed by the State and held that Section 5 was enacted in order to\nenable the court to do substantial justice to the parties by disposing of matters\non merits. The expression \"sufficient cause\" is adequately elastic to enable\nthe court to apply the law in a meaningful manner which subserves the ends\nof justice that being the life-purpose for the existence of the institution of\nE\ncourts. It is common knowledge that this Court has been making a justifiably\nliberal approach in matters instituted in this Court. But the message does not\nappear to have percolated down to all the other courts in the hierarchy. This\nCourt reiterated that the expression \"every day's delay must be explained\"\ndoes not mean that a pedantic approach should be made. The doctrine must\nF be applied in a rational common sense pragmatic manner. When substantial\njustice and technical considerations are pitted against each other, cause of\nsubstantial justice deserves to be preferred for the other side cannot claim to\nhave vested right in injustice being done because of a non-deliberate delay.\nThere is no presumption that delay is occasioned deliberately, or on account\nof culpable negligence, or on account of mala fides. A litigant does not stand\nG\nto benefit by resorting to delay. In fact he runs a serious risk. Judiciary is not\nrespected on account of its power to legalise injustice on technical grounds\nbut because it is capable of removing injustice and is expected to do so.\nMaking a justice-oriented approach from this perspective, there was sufficient\ncause for condoning the delay in the institution of the appeal. The fact that\nHit was the State which was seeking condonation and not a private party was\nT\n-\n1\n115\nSTATE OF NAGALAND v. LIPOK AO [PASAYAT, J.]\naltogether irrelevant. The doctrine of equality before law demands that all A\nlitigants, including the State as a litigant, are accorded the same treatment\nand the law is administered in an even-handed manner. There is no warrant\nfor according a step-motherly treatment when the State is the applicant. The\ndelay was accordingly condoned.\nC\nExperience shows that on account of an impersonal machinery (no one\nB\nin charge of the matter is directly hit or hurt by the judgment sought to be\nsubjected to appeal) and the inherited bureaucratic methodology imbued with\nthe note-making, file-pushing, and passing-on-the-buck ethos, delay on its\npart is less difficult to understand though more difficult to approve. The State\nwhich represents collective cause of the community, does not deserve a litigant-\nnon-grata status. The courts, therefore, have to be informed with the spirit\nand philosophy of the provision in the course of the interpretation of the\nexpression of sufficient cause. Merit is preferred to scuttle a decision on\nmerits in turning down the case on technicalities of delay in presenting the\nappeal. Delay as accordingly condoned, the order was set aside and the\nmatter was remitted to the High Court for disposal on merits after affording D\nopportunity of hearing to the parties. In Prabha v. Ram Parkash Kalra,\n[1987] Supp SCC 339, this Court had held that the court should not adopt an\ninjustice-oriented approach in rejecting the application for condonation of\ndelay. The appeal was allowed, the delay was condoned and the matter was\nremitted for expeditious disposal in accordance with law.\nE\nIn G. Ramegowda, Major v. Spl. Land Acquisition Officer, [1988] 2\nSCC 142, it was held that no general principle saving the party from all\nmistakes of its counsel could be laid. The expression \"sufficient cause” must\nreceive a liberal construction so as to advance substantial justice and generally\ndelays in preferring the appeals are required to be condoned in the interest F\nof justice where no gross negligence or deliberate inaction or lack of bona\nfides is imputable to the party seeking condonation of delay. In litigations to\nwhich Government is a party, there is yet another aspect which, perhaps,\ncannot be ignored. If appeals brought by Government are lost for such defaults,\nno person is individually affected, but what, in the ultimate analysis, suffers\nis public interest. The decisions of Government are collective and institutional\ndecisions and do not share the characteristics of decisions of private individuals.\nThe law of limitation is, no doubt, the same for a private citizen as for\ngovernmental authorities. Government, like any other litigant must take\nresponsibility for the acts, omissions of its officers. But a somewhat different\ncomplexion is imparted to the matter where Government makes out a case H\nG\n116\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2005] 3 S.C.R.\nA where public interest was shown to have suffered owing to acts of fraud or\nbad faith on the part of its officers or agents and where the officers were\nclearly at cross-purposes with it. It was, therefore, held that in assessing what\nconstitutes sufficient cause for purposes of Section 5, it might, perhaps, be\nsomewhat unrealistic to exclude from the consideration that go into the judicial\nverdict, these factors which are peculiar to and characteristic of the functioning\nof the Government. Government decisions are proverbially slow encumbered,\nas they are, by a considerable degree of procedural red-tape in the process of\ntheir making. A certain amount of latitude is, therefore, not impermissible. It\nis rightly said that those who bear responsibility of Government must have\n\"a little play at the joints\". Due recognition of these limitations on\nC governmental functioning of course, within reasonable limits is necessary\nB\nD\nE\nif the judicial approach is not to be rendered unrealistic. It would, perhaps,\nbe unfair and unrealistic to put Government and private parties on the same\nfooting in all respects in such matters. Implicit in the very nature of\nGovernmental functioning is procedural delay incidental to the decision-\nmaking process. The delay of over one year was accordingly condoned.\n-\nIt is axiomatic that decisions are taken by officers/agencies proverbially\nat slow pace and encumbered process of pushing the files from table to table\nand keeping it on table for considerable time causing delay - intentional or\notherwise is a routine. Considerable delay of procedural red-tape in the\nprocess of their making decision is a common feature. Therefore, certain\namount of latitude is not impermissible. If the appeals brought by the State\nare lost for such default no person is individually affected but what in the\nultimate analysis suffers, is public interest. The expression \"sufficient cause\"\nshould, therefore, be considered with pragmatism in justice-oriented approach\nrather than the technical detection of sufficient cause for explaining every\nF day's delay. The factors which are peculiar to and characteristic of the\nfunctioning of the governmental conditions would be cognizant to and requires\nadoption of pragmatic approach in justice-oriented process. The court should\ndecide the matters on merits unless the case is hopelessly without merit. No\nseparate standards to determine the cause laid by the State vis-a-vis private\nlitigant could be laid to prove strict standards of sufficient cause. The\nGovernment at appropriate level should constitute legal cells to examine the\ncases whether any legal principles are involved for decision by the courts or\nwhether cases require adjustment and should authorise the officers to take a\ndecision or give appropriate permission for settlement. In the event of decision\nto file appeal needed prompt action should be pursued by the officer\nH responsible to file the appeal and he should be made personally responsible\nG\n'\n1\nง\nSTATE OF NAGALAND v. LIPOK AO] [PASAYAT, J.]\n117\nfor lapses, if any. Equally, the State cannot be put on the same footing as an A\nindividual. The individual would always be quick in taking the decision\nwhether he would pursue the remedy by way of an appeal or application\nsince he is a person legally injured while State is an impersonal machinery\nworking through its officers or servants.\nThe above position was highlighted in State of Haryana v. Chandra\nMani and Ors., [1996] 3 SCC 132 and Special Tehsildar, Land Acquisition,\nKerala v. K.V. Ayisumma, [1996] 10 SCC 634. It was noted that adoption of\nstrict standard of proof sometimes fail to protract public justice, and it would\nresult in public mischief by skilful management of delay in the process of\nfiling an appeal.\nWhen the factual background is considered in the light of legal principles\nas noted above the inevitable conclusion is that the delay of 57 days deserved\ncondonation. Therefore, the order of the High Court refusing to condone the\ndelay is set aside.\nIn normal course, we would have required the High Court to consider\nthe application praying for grant of leave on merits. But keeping in view the\nlong passage of time and the points involved, we deem it proper to direct\ngrant of leave to appeal. The appeal shall be registered and disposed of on\nmerits. It shall not be construed that we have expressed any merits on the\nappeal to be adjudicated by the High Court.\nAppeal is allowed.\nB.B.B.\nAppeal allowed.\nB\nC\nD\n"}
