A brief reference to the factual aspect would suffice.\nC\n·é†\nE\nThe appellant filed the writ petition challenging the order dated 16.9.2004\nand notice dated 16.9.2004 issued by the Additional Collector (Stamps) Jaipur.\nThe demand raised by the State of Rajasthan was in respect of alleged F\nrevenue loss caused by the appellant to the State Government by its\npurchasing stamps from other State i.e. Maharashtra. The writ petition was\ndismissed by learned Single Judge on the ground of availability of alternative\nremedy. Appellant filed the Special Appeal questioning correctness of the\norder passed by the learned Single Judge. Along with Special Appeal an\nG\napplication for stay was also filed. The Special Appeal was disposed of with\nthe direction to the respondent- State to constitute a High Power Committee\nto resolve the dispute. The High Power Committee by its order dated 27.4.2005\nheld that the appellant is liable to pay to the State of Rajasthan a sum of\nRs.576.72 lakhs Appellant filed an application for revival of the Special Appeal\nand revival of the interim direction passed in the said appeal. Though initially H\n116\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 2 S.C.R.\nA the application was dismissed, subsequently the same was revived. Dealing\nwith the said application it was noted by the High Court by order dated\n11.12.2004 that the demand of Rs.1,19,75,000/- made against the appellant\ndoes not exceed the loan advanced by the appellant-Corporation to the State\nof Rajasthan. Liberty was given to the State of Rajasthan to adjust the\namount of its demand against the loan advanced by the appellant-Corporation\nto the State Government.\nB\nC\nD\n4. Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the Rajasthan Stamp\nLaw (Adaptation) Act, 1952 (in short the 'Act') does not in reality authorize\nthe demand as has been made in the present case.\n5. Learned counsel for the respondent-State on the other hand submitted\nthat the provisions contained in the aforesaid Act clearly permit the action\nas taken by the authority.\n6. Since the matter is pending consideration of the High Court it would\nnot be\nproper for us to decide the issues on merits though learned counsel\nfor the parties made a request in that regard.

Undisputedly several divisions of the appellant-Corporation in\nRajasthan purchase stamps from Maharashtra. Stand of the State Government\nE is that purchase of stamps from outside Rajasthan was against the provisions\nof the Act and the Rules made thereunder. The view expressed was that\nofficers of the appellant-Corporation would purchase stamps from the Rajasthan\ntreasuries only.\nF\n7. In the circumstances, the High Court is requested to take up the\nSpecial Appeal for disposal expeditiously.
