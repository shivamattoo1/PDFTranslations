This writ petition filed under Article 32 of the\nConstitution of India, 1950 (in short the 'Constitution') presents some unusual\nfeatures. In mythology Sati Savitri's prayer ensured that her husband Satyaban\nescaped jaws of death. Petitioner Smt. Angrej Kaur is the wife of one B.S.F.,\nConstable named Surjit Singh. Though he has been declared to have died in\nthe Indo-Pak war in 1971, the petitioner on the basis of certain materials D\nbelieves that he is alive and is languishing in Kot Lakhpat Rai Jail, Pakistan.\nThe factual scenario in the present petition as projected by the petitioner\nruns in somewhat similar lines and even at first flush may appear fictional.\nIt is in essence prayer for writ in the nature of habeas corpus. Though\ntechnically it may appear to be unacceptable as the concerned person is E\nstated to be in custody in a Pakistan jail, yet the petitioner's human emotions\nrefuse to accept this legal landline.\nnoted.\nFirst the factual background as projected by the petitioner needs to be\n1\n1\nF\nÂ· Surjit Singh was Constable in 57 Battalion of B.S.F. and he was posted\nin Chhamb Sector on 3rd/4th December, 1971. Initially he was reported to be\nmissing. A communication dated 26.7.1972 was received by the petitioner\nfrom the concerned authorities granting her family pension of Rs. 130 as\nSurjit Singh was reported to be missing. On 26.9.1974 the Commandant of\nthe concerned authority issued certificate to the effect that for all official G\npurposes he had died on 4.12.1971 while on duty. A letter to this effect was\nalso received by the petitioner. In spite of these informations, the petitioner\nbelieves that her husband is alive and she did not believe that he could have\ndied. Her unfailing faith on the almighty made her believe that the information\nwas wrong. She awaited for information about Surjit Singh being alive, as H\nB\nD\n1142\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2005] 3 S.C.R.\nA her prayers were coming from her heart. Her son Amrik Singh was hardly\none year of age at the time his father was reported dead. Now he is in his\nthirties. Though more than three decades passed by, she refused to believe\nthat her husband has died. She read in the newspaper (Punjabi Daily) 'Ajit'\non 3.9.2004 that one Khushi Mohammad had returned from Pakistan Jail\nafter 14 years. The news report indicated that though Khushi Mohammad and\nfew others were released there were as many as eighty five Indians Still lying\nin jails of Pakistan in pitiable circumstances and the name of one Surjit Singh\nwas mentioned along with others. The petitioner believes that said Surjit\nSingh was none other than her husband. On 4.9.2004 Amrik Singh went to\nmeet aforesaid Khushi Mohammad at Nishant Colony, Malerkotla City, Punjab\nC and showed him the photograph of his father Surjit Singh. Khushi Mohammad\nimmediately identified the person in the photograph and confirmed having\nseen him in 'Kot Lakhpat Rai Jail' in Pakistan. This news was of a great\nsolace and joy to the petitioner and her family members. On 16.9.2004 Amrik\nSingh met other persons who had been released along with Khushi Mohammad.\nThey also identified the photograph of Surjit Singh and confirmed having\nseen in Kot Lakhpat Rai Jail in Pakistan. On 24.9.1994 the petitioner sent\nrepresentation to various authorities, functionaries and dignitaries requesting\nthat efforts be made to bring back Surjit Singh from Pakistan Jail. Making a\ngrievance that she had not received any positive response to her petition, the\nwrit petition was filed. On 7.2.2005 direction was given to the opposite\nE parties to look into the grievance of the petitioner within a period of four\nweeks. An affidavit has been filed on behalf of the Union of India, Ministry\nof Home Affairs and the Directorate of B.S.F. Various steps taken by the\nauthorities have been indicated. From the status report, we find that steps\nhave been taken to find out actual position. It also appears that initial response\nof the Pakistan authorities was that they have checked various jails but\nConstable Surjit Singh could not be traced. It appears that the matter has been\ndiscussed at the B.S.F. and Pakistan Rangers meetings. In the India-Pakistan\nQuarterly Meeting (DIG level), the matter was discussed on 29.12.2004. In\nFebruary, 2005, the Pakistan authorities intimated that steps were being taken\nto trace Constable Surjit Singh and he will be repatriated if found in Pakistan.\nG Since there was a negative response from the Pakistan authorities, later matter\nappears to have been taken up at Bio-Annual meeting and the B.S.F. authorities\nhave requested their counterparts in B.S.F. to take up the matter expeditiously.\nWe are satisfied that the B.S.F. authorities have taken all possible steps to\nfind out the petitioner's husband. Let the Ministry of External Affairs which\nwas requested by B.S.F. authorities to look into the matter also intervene in\nH the matter. If a soldier, while fighting for the country's security, is captured\nF\n-\n1\nANGREJ KAUR v. U.O.I. [PASAYAT. J.]\n1143\nand taken to other country's prison contrary to the official belief that he was A\ndead, it would be in the interest of not only petitioner and her family members\nbut also for the armed forces of this country to see that he is brought back\nto our country. It is not to be understood that we are issuing a writ of habeas\ncorpus to any authority outside India. Our directions essentially relate to\nIndian officials. But it cannot be lost sight of that law cannot ever be a\nB\ncombination of meaningless and purposeless combination of words. The\njudicial system reaches its pinnacle when it serves the ultimate object of all\nlaws; i.e. delivering justice to the recipient who deserves it, not shackled by\npitfalls and landmines of technicalities. Within the four corners of legal\nframework, the reliefs can be moulded to achieve the ultimate objective, that\nis to deliver justice.\nC\nWe, therefore, dispose of this writ petition with the direction that the\nauthorities shall continue the efforts to find out the actual position and\nexpeditiously intimate the petitioner, the results of the efforts/inquiries made\nby them. Though we are disposing of the writ petition, let status report\nindicating the latest development in the matter be filed within three months, D\nwhich shall be placed before us.\nS.K.S.\nThe writ petition is accordingly disposed of.\nWrit Petition disposed of.\n"}
