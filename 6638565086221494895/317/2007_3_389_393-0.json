[Para 11] [393-C]\nCIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 5452 of 2000.\nFrom the final Judgment and Decree dated 27.5.1998 of the High Court\nof Karnataka at Bangalore in R.S.A. No. 236/1991.\nS.N. Bhat for the Appellant.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nDR. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. 1. Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment\nof a learned Single Judge of the Karnataka High Court allowing the Second\nAppeal filed by respondent No.1. Originally, there were three defendants and\nthe present appeal has been filed only by defendant no.1. The other defendants\nwere impleaded as respondents 2 and 3 in the present appeal but their names\nwere deleted at the request of the appellant. Though several points were\nurged in support of the appeal, we think it unnecessary to deal with them in\ndetail considering the primary stand taken that the Second Appeal was allowed\nwithout formulating any substantial question of law as required under Section.\n100 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (in short the 'Code').\n2. None appeared for the respondent in spite of service of notice.\n3. Section 100 of the Code deals with \"second appeal\". The provision\nreads as follows:\n\"100 (1) Save as otherwise expressly provided in the body of this\nCode or by any other law for the time being in force, an appeal shall\nB.C. SHIVASHANKARA v. B.R. NAGARAJ [PASAYAT, J.]\n391\nlie to the High Court from every decree passed in appeal by any court A\nsubordinate to the High Court, if the High Court is satisfied that the\ncase involves a substantial question of law.\n(2) An appeal may lie under this section from an appellate decree\npassed ex-parte.\n(3) In an appeal under this section, the memorandum of appeal shall\nprecisely state the substantial question of law involved in the appeal.\n(4) Where the High Court is satisfied that a substantial question of\nlaw is involved in any case, it shall formulate that question.\n(5) The appeal shall be heard on the question so formulated and the\nrespondent shall, at the hearing of the appeal, be allowed to argue\nthat the case does not involve such question:\nProvided that nothing in this sub-section shall be deemed to take\naway or abridge the power of the Court to hear, for reasons to be\nrecorded, the appeal on any other substantial question of law, not\nformulated by it, if it is satisfied that the case involves such question.\"\n4. A perusal of the impugned judgment passed by the High Court does\nnot show that any substantial question of law has been formulated or that\nthe second appeal was heard on the question, if any, so formulated. That\nbeing so, the judgment cannot be maintained.\n5. In Ishwar Dass Jain v. Sohan Lal, [2000] 1 SCC 434 this Court in para\n10 has stated thus:\nB\nC\nD\nE\n\"10. Now under Section 100 CPC, after the 1976 amendment, it is\nF\nessential for the High Court to formulate a substantial question of law\nand it is not permissible to reverse the judgment of the first appellate\ncourt without doing so.”\n6. Yet again in Roop Singh v. Ram Singh, [2000] 3 SCC 708 this Court\nhas expressed that the jurisdiction of a High Court is confined to appeals G\ninvolving substantial question of law. Para 7 of the said judgment reads:\n\"7. It is to be reiterated that under Section 100 CPC jurisdiction of the\nHigh Court to entertain a second appeal is confined only to such\nappeals which involve a substantial question of law and it does not\nconfer any jurisdiction on the High Court to interfere with pure H\n392\nA\nB\nC\nᎠ\nE\nF\nG\nH\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 3 S.C.R.\nquestions of fact while exercising its jurisdiction under Section 100\nCPC. That apart, at the time of disposing of the matter, the High Court\ndid not even notice the question of law formulated by it at the time\nof admission of the second appeal as there is no reference of it in the\nimpugned judgment. Further, the fact finding courts after appreciating\nthe evidence held that the defendant entered into the possession of\nthe premises as a batai, that is to say, as a tenant and his possession\nwas permissive and there was no pleading or proof as to when it\nbecame adverse and hostile. These findings recorded by the two\ncourts below were based on proper appreciation of evidence and the\nmaterial on record and there was no perversity, illegality or irregularity\nin those findings. If the defendant got the possession of suit land as\na lessee or under a batai agreement then from the permissive possession\nit is for him to establish by cogent and convincing evidence to show\nhostile animus Page 1532 and possession adverse to the knowledge\nof the real owner. Mere possession for a long time does not result in\nconverting permissive possession into adverse possession Thakur\nKishan Singh v. Arvind Kumar, [1994] 6 SCC 591. Hence the High\nCourt ought not to have interfered with the findings of fact recorded\nby both the courts below.\n7. The position has been reiterated in Kanhaiyalal v. Anupkumar,\n[2003] 1 SCC 430.\n8. In Chadat Singh v. Bahadur Ram and Ors., [2004] 6 SCC 359, it was\nobserved thus:\n\"6. In view of Section 100 of the Code the memorandum of appeal shall\nprecisely state substantial question or questions involved in the appeal\nas required under Sub-section (3) of Section100. Where the High\nCourt is satisfied that in any case any substantial question of law is\ninvolved, it shall formulate that question under Sub-section (4) and\nthe second appeal has to be heard on the question so formulated as\nstated in Sub-section (5) of Section 100.\"\n9. The position was highlighted by this Court in Joseph Severane and Ors.\nv. Benny Mathew and Ors., [2005] 7 SCC 667, Sasikumar and Ors. v. Kunnath\nChellappan Nair and Ors., [2005] 12 SCC 588] and Gian Dass v. Gram\nPanchayat, Village Sunner Kalan and Ors., [2006] 6 SCC 271.\n10. Sub-section (5) of Section 100 is applicable only when any substantial\n\"\nI\nB.C. SHIVASHANKARA v. B.R. NAGARAJ [PASAYAT, J.] 393\nquestion of law has already been formulated and it empowers the High Court A\nto hear, for reasons to be recorded, the appeal on any other substantial\nquestion of law. The expression \"on any other substantial question of law\"\nclearly shows that there must be some substantial question of law already\nformulated and then only another substantial question of law which was not\nformulated earlier can be taken up by the High Court for reasons to be\nB\nrecorded, if it is of the view that the case involves such question.\n11. Under the circumstances the impugned judgment is set aside. We\nremit the matter to the High Court so far as it relates to Second Appeal No.\n236 of 1991 for disposal in accordance with law. The appeal is disposed of\nin the aforesaid terms with no order as to costs.\nB.B.B.\nC\nAppeal disposed of.\n"}
