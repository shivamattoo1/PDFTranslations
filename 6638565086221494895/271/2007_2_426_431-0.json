The goods so exported were eligible for\nDuty Entitlement Pass Book (DEPB) Benefit/Scheme. Accordingly, the\nassessee claimed the benefit under the Scheme as per Rules. The assessee\nhad declared a market value of Rs.52.50 per piece which was worked out at\n150% of the assessee's purchase price of Rs.35/- per piece. Revenue\nproceeded against the assessee by alleging that the assessee had mis-declared\nthe FOB value at US $40 (Rs. 150/-) per piece to get more DEPB benefit under\nthe Scheme. Revenue computed the FOB price @ Rs.80/- per piece and\nG ordered that the assessee would be entitled to DEPB credit on the basis of the\nFOB price of Rs.80/- per piece and not at the sale price. Besides, the assessee\nwas held liable for mis-declaration and accordingly the goods in question were\nconfiscated and the penalty under Section 114 of the Customs Act was also\nimposed. Commissioner (Appeals) upheld the order in appeal filed by the\nH\n426\nT\nA\n'\n=1\nH\nCOMMNR. OF CUSTOMS. NEW CUSTOMS HOUSE. MUMBAI . VISHAL EXPORTS OVERSEAS LTD.\n427\nassessee. On appeal, the Tribunal set aside the orders of the Revenue A\nauthorities and allowed the appeal. Hence the present appeal.\nRevenue contended that there could not be such a vast variation in-\nbetween the domestic price of Rs. 35/- per piece and the declared FOB value\nof Rs.157/- per piece, therefore, it was obvious that the assessee had claimed\ninflated price with the sole objective of getting undeserved DEPB credit; that B\nthe Tribunal had not taken into consideration the evidence on record\nregarding the price; and that the matter was completely covered by a decision\nof this Court in Om Prakash Bhatia v. Commissioner of Customs, Delhi.\nC\nRespondent-assessee submitted that it was unthinkable that the party\nto which the exports were made would act hand-in-glove with the assessee to\nmake inflated payments to enable him to get undeserved DEPB credit; that\nthe fixing of price of the goods at Rs.80/- per piece by the Adjudicating\nAuthority as also by the Commissioner (Appeals) was based on no evidence;\nand that there was no evidence whatsoever to support the finding that the export\nprice is not genuine and was mis-declared with the intent to avail higher DEPB D\nbenefit.\nDismissing the appeal, the Court\nHELD: 1.1. The contention of the Revenue to the effect that the FOB\nvalue of the goods in question being 450% more than the purchase value is E\nunreasonable and cannot be accepted for the simple reason that there is no\nevidence on record to support such a contention. The Tribunal has also\nspecifically held so and returned a final finding of fact that the FOB price\nwas correctly shown by the assessee. Revenue could not show anything\nconcrete in support of its contention. From the orders of the appellate\nauthorities nothing can be found to hold that the FOB price was excessive or\nnot genuine. The Tribunal has also given a finding that the Adjudicating\nAuthority has arbitrarily computed the FOB value and have fixed the credit\non that basis. In the absence of any concrete evidence having been put by\nRevenue to support the contention that the FOB price is inflated, the findings\nof the Tribunal are accepted. [Para 9] [430-H; 431-A-B]\n1.2. It is not a case of the Revenue that the assessee has not received\nthe FOB price at all. That is clear from the BRCs. Therefore, the FOB price\nis supported amply by the BRCs with which no fault is found. Once that is\nclear, there will be no question to hold that the FOB is inflated.

As per the policy also the credit has to be linked with FOB price.\nThe fact that the present market value (PMV) is also correctly fixed and is\nwithin the permissible limits i.e. 150% of AR4 value could not be ignored.\nThe market value is fixed at Rs.52.50. That has also been found to be in order\nby the Tribunal. Hence, finding of the Tribunal in this behalf is also accepted.\n[Para 10] [431-D]\nOm Prakash Bhatia v.

Chandraseakhran, Rupesh Kumar (for Tara Chandra Sharma) for the\nRespondent.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nV.S. SIRPURKAR, J. 1. Final order of Customs, Excise \u0026 Gold (Control)\nAppellate Tribunal (hereinafter called \"the Tribunal\" for short) allowing the\nappeal filed by M/s. Vishal Exports Overseas Limited (hereinafter called “the\nassessee\" for short) is in challenge at the instance of Commissioner of\nCustoms (hereinafter called “the Revenue” for short).\n2. The assessee exported 4.8 lakh pieces of coffee mugs between February\nand November, 2001. The export price (FOB) was US $3.40 per piece. The\nexported goods were eligible for Duty Entitlement Pass Book (DEPB) Benefit/\nScheme. Accordingly, the same was claimed as per Rules at the rate of 11%\nor 10%. The assessee had declared a market value of Rs.52.50 per piece which\nwas worked out at 150% of the assessee's purchase price which was\nG Rs.35/- per piece. These purchases were made from the manufacturers in\nRajasthan and as per the clearance documents of Central Excise (AR-4),\nRs.35/- was the price per piece.\n3. The Assistant Commissioner of Customs proceeded against the\nassessee by alleging that the assessee had mis-declared the FOB value at US\nH $3.40 (Rs.150/-) per piece. It was the view of the Department that the price\n1\ni\n71\nCOMMNR. OF CUSTOMS. NEW CUSTOMS HOUSE, MUMBAI v. VISHAL EXPORTS OVERSEAS LTD. ĮSIRPURKAR. J.J 429\nwas inflated to get more DEPB benefit. The original order ensued wherein it A\nwas held that the export price was not genuine considering the local purchase\nprice to be Rs.35/- per piece only. It was held that the export price could not\nbe as high as Rs.157/- (450%) and that it was unlikely that there would be\nsuch a vast variation between the domestic price and export price acceptable\nin the competitive export market. By making his own calculations, the FOB\nB\nprice was computed and fixed at Rs.80/- per piece in place of Rs.157/- per\npiece by the Assistant Commissioner. It was further ordered that the assessee\nwould be entitled to DEPB credit on the basis of the FOB price of Rs.80/- per\npiece and not at the sale price. Holding the declared FOB price of Rs.157/-\nper piece or US $3.40 per piece a mis-declaration, the Assistant Commissioner\nheld that the goods were liable to be confiscated and the penalty under C\nSection 114 of the Customs Act was also ordered.\n4. Commissioner (Appeals) upheld the order in appeal filed by the\nassessee. The Commissioner (Appeals) held that the assessee was not liable\nto any further benefit than the one which was granted by the adjudicating\nauthority. On appeal, the Tribunal set aside the orders of the authorities below D\nand allowed the appeal. It is against this order that the present statutory\nappeal has been filed.\n5. Shri R. Basant, Learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the Revenue\nassailed the order of the Tribunal and pointed out that there could not be\nE\nsuch a vast variation in between the domestic price of Rs.35/- per piece and\nthe declared FOB value of Rs.157/- per piece, therefore, it was obvious that\nthe assessee had claimed inflated price with the sole objective of getting\nundeserved DEPB credit. Learned counsel secondly contended that the\nTribunal had not taken into consideration the evidence on record regarding\nthe price. Lastly, the learned counsel contended that the matter was completely\ncovered by a decision of this Court in Om Prakash Bhatia v. Commissioner\nof Customs, Delhi reported in (2003) 155 ELT 423 SC = [2003] 6 SCC 161.\n6. As against this Shri M.Chandrasekharan, Senior Counsel drew our\nattention to the Export and Import Policy (1st April, 1997-31st March, 2002)\nand more particularly at para 7.25 which reads as under:\n\"Under the Duty Entitlement Pass Book (DEPB) Scheme an exporter\nshall be eligible to claim credit at a specified percentage of FOB value\nof exports made in freely convertible currency. The credit shall be\navailable against such export products and at such rates as may be\nF\nG\nH\n430\nA\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS [2007] 2 S.C.R.\nspecified by the Director General of Foreign Trade by a Public Notice\nissued in this behalf.\nXX\nXX\nXX\nXX\"\n7. Learned Senior Counsel argues that the basis for the benefit of DEPB\nB is the FOB value in support of which voluminous evidence was given by the\nassessee and more particularly such evidence was in the form of (i) S/Bs\n(print-outs); (ii) Invoices; (iii) Packing lists; (iv) Bills of Lading; (v) BRCs; and\n(v) AR4s. Learned counsel painstakingly points out that there was no dispute\nanywhere regarding the BRC which showed that the FOB price claimed by the\nassessee was, actually, received by the assessee. According to the learned\ncounsel it was unthinkable that the party to which the exports were made\nwould act hand-in-glove with the assessee to make inflated payments to the\nassessee with the sole objective of obliging the assessee so as to enable him\nto get undeserved DEPB credit. He points out that the fixing of the price at\nRs.80/- per piece by the Adjudicating Authority as also by the Commissioner\nD (Appeals) was based on no evidence. Learned counsel further urged that\nC\nE\nthose authorities could not have been allowed to \"imagine\" the price. Learned\ncounsel further invites our attention to the findings by the Tribunal in para\n4 of its judgment wherein the Tribunal has clearly held that there was no\nmaterial on record to indicate that the export price declared by the appellant\nwas not genuine or that the transaction was at a different price. Our attention\nwas also drawn by the learned counsel towards further finding that the market\nvalue declaration made by the assessee is also fully supported by its purchase\nprice from the manufacturer in India. Learned counsel also argued that the\nTribunal has correctly held that the finding regarding the FOB price being\nRs.80/- per piece was based on the computation of the price from manufacturer's\nF price which had no relation with the price in export trade. Our attention was\nfurther drawn to the finding that there was no evidence whatsoever to support\nthe finding that the export price is not genuine and was mis-declared with the\nintent to avail higher DEPB benefit. Lastly, the learned counsel pointed out\nthat the aforementioned judgment in Om Prakash Bhatia's case (supra) could\nnot be pressed into service because that judgment was in the draw-back\nG scheme and not related to DEPB Scheme.\n8. We have considered the matter in the light of the above contentions.\n9. The first contention of the appellant herein to the effect that the FOB\nvalue being 450% more than the purchase value is unreasonable and cannot\nH be accepted for the simple reason that there is no evidence on record to\n✓\n+\n5\n*\nCOMMNR. OF CUSTOMS. NEW CUSTOMS HOUSE. MUMBAI 1. VISHAL EXPORTS OVERSEAS LTD. ĮSIRPURKAR. J.I 431\nsupport such a contention. The Tribunal has also specifically held so and A\nreturned a final finding of fact that the FOB price was correctly shown by the\nassessee. Learned counsel for the appellant could not show us anything\nconcrete in support of his contention. From the orders of the first and the\nappellate authorities nothing can be found to hold that the FOB price was\nexcessive or not genuine. The Tribunal has also given a finding that the\nB\nAdjudicating Authority has arbitrarily computed the FOB value and have\nfixed the credit on that basis. We accept findings of the Tribunal in the\nabsence of any concrete evidence having been put to support the contention\nof the learned counsel that the FOB price is inflated. In this behalf we cannot\nignore the documents supplied by the assessee before the Revenue which we\nhave already mentioned earlier. It is not a case of the Revenue that the C\nassessee has not received the FOB price at all. That is clear from the BRCs.\nTherefore, the FOB price is supported amply by the BRCS with which no fault\nis found. Once that is clear, there will be no question to hold that the FOB\nis inflated.\n10. As per the policy also the credit has to be linked with the FOB price. D\nAgain we cannot ignore the fact that the PMV is also correctly fixed and is\nwithin the permissible limits i.e. 150% of AR4 value. The market value is fixed\nat Rs.52.50. That has also been found to be in order by the Tribunal. Therefore,\nwe accept the finding of the Tribunal in this behalf and reject the contention\nof the learned counsel for the Revenue.\nE\n11. It was lastly contended that the matter is covered by the decision\nin Om Prakash Bhatia's case (supra). This was clearly against draw_ back\nscheme and not DEPB credit. We have carefully seen the judgment. We do\nnot find that on the basis of the factual scenario therein it applies in any\nmanner to the present controversy. There the factor of over-invoicing was F\nfound established. In the present case on the factual aspect also the FOB\nprice could not be said to be inflated. In our opinion the aforementioned\njudgment would be of no consequence and help to the Revenue.\n12. In view of the above we are of the opinion that the appeal has no\nmerits and it must be dismissed. It is accordingly dismissed.\n13. There will be no order as to costs.\nG\nS.K.S.\nAppeal dismissed.\n"}
