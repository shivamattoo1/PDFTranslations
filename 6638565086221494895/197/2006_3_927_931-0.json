But he misplaced / lost the IVPs. Post Office turned down the claim of\nRespondent for duplicate IVPS on ground that there was no provision for\nreplacement of a lost IVP. Against the action of Post Office, Respondent filed\npetition before the District Consumer Forum, but the petition was dismissed.\nThereafter, Respondent filed suit before the Civil Court which decreed in its\nfavour.

An IVP is akin to an ordinary currency note. It bears no name\nof the holder. Just as a lost currency note cannot be replaced, similarly the G\nquestion of replacing a lost IVP does not arise. Rule 7(2) of the Indira Vikas\nPatra Rules, 1986 makes it clear that a certificate lost, stolen, mutilated,\ndefaced or destroyed beyond recognition will not be replaced by any Post Office.\nSimilar is the position as regards the certificate which is either lost or stolen.\n927\nH\nB\nA\n928\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2006] 3 S.C.R.\nA Undisputedly there was no challenge to the legality of Rule 7(2).

It is, however, evident from the record that Respondent in the first\nB appeal has been paid the amount pursuant to the direction given in the suit as\naffirmed by the High Court. In the peculiar circumstances, the Respondent\nshall not be liable to refund the amount in the peculiar circumstances of the\ncase. [931-E]\n2.2. So far as the second appeal is concerned, if the appellants have not\nC made the payment, they shall not be liable to make payment. But if the payment\nhas already been made as in the case of the first appeal then no recovery\nshall be made. [931-F]\nD\nE\n2.3. This direction is being given in view of the statement made by the\nappellants that considering the small amount involved the appellant will not\nclaim refund, but the position in law has to be set at rest as large number of\nsuch claims are being made. [931-G]\nCIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 4819 of 2000.\nFrom the Judgment and Order dated 12.8.1998 of the High Court of\nKarnataka at Bangalore in C.R.P. No. 2192/1996.\nC.A. No. 1934/20006.\nWITH\nF\nG\nB.B. Singh, Ravinder Agarwal, V.K. Verma, Kumar Rajesh Singh and\nP. Parmeswaran for the Appellant.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nARIJIT PASAYAT, J. Leave granted in SLP (C) No.11387 of 2003.\nThese two appeals involve identical questions and are, therefore, taken\nup for disposal together.\nChallenge is to the direction given in the suit as affirmed in the order\npassed in the Civil Revision directing payment of maturity value in respect\nof Indira Vikas Patras (for short ‘IVPs').\nUndisputed position is that the respondent in each case had purchased\nH IVPs from post offices. Respondent in each case was entitled to receive\n1\nCENTRAL GOVERNMENT OF INDIA v. KRISHNAJI PARVETESH KULKARNI [PASAYAT, J.1929\nmaturity value on presentation of the certificate. In each case respondent lost\nA\nIVPs. In Civil Appeal No. 4819 of 2000 the respondent claimed to have lodged\na complaint at the police station about the loss of IVPs. He also informed\nabout the loss of IVPs to the Postal Superintendent with the request to look\ninto the matter. The Postal Superintendent informed the respondent that there\nis no provision for replacement of any IVP lost, stolen, mutilated, defaced or\ndestroyed. Therefore, the claim for duplicate IVPs was turned down. The\nB\nrespondent filed petition before the District Consumer Disputes Redressal\nForum taking the stand that post office was not justified in its action. Since\nthe IVPs are transferable from one person to another like currency notes\nwithout involving the postal agency duplicated should be issued. The\nConsumer Forum dismissed the application. Thereafter the respondent filed\na suit before the Civil Court which decreed the suit in favour of the respondent.\nRevision petition was filed before the High Court which was dismissed. The\nHigh Court held that since the loss of the IVPs is bona fide and there is no\nattempt to defeat the interest of the postal authorities and as none else had\nmade a claim on the basis of the said IVPs., the original holder of the IVPS\nwas entitled to payment of the IVPs on the maturity value.\nC\nᎠ\nIn the other appeal position is somewhat similar except that the\nrespondent had not approached the Consumer Forum. The respondent filed\na suit for declaration that he was owner of the IVPs which were lost and was\nentitled to get payment of the maturity value. The suit was decreed. Civil\nrevision petition was also dismissed on the ground that if the loss of the IVP E\nis genuine and bona fide, the Central Government has a commitment to refund\nthe amount of security.\nLearned counsel for the appellant submitted that the approach of the\nTrial Court and the High Court is clearly contrary to law. He submitted that\nF\nHigh Court had failed to notice its earlier decision in J. Kemparayappa v.\nUnion of India (W.P. No. 43361/1995 decided on 18.7.1996) that IVPs are\nbearer bonds which are freely transferable and payment will have to be made\nto the person producing them and therefore question of issuing duplicates\ndoes not arise in the event of loss.\nThe transactions relating to IVPs are governed by the Indira Vikas Patra\nRules, 1986 (in short the 'Rules'). The Rules have been framed in exercise of\npower conferred under the Government Savings Certificates Act, 1959 (in\nshort 'the Act'). The relevant Rule 7(2) reads as follows:\nG\n\"7(2): A certificate lost, stolen, mutilated, defaced or destroyed beyond H\n.\n930\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\nrecognition, will not be replaced by any Post Office.\"\n[2006] 3 S.C.R.\nSome of the other provisions which are relevant are Rules 6, 8 and 9.\nThey read as follows:\n\"6. Issue of Certificate:-\n(1) On payment being made by cash, a certificate shall be issued\nimmediately and date of such certificate shall be the date of payment.\n(2) Where payment for purchase of a certificate is made by locally\nexecuted cheque, pay order or demand draft, the certificate shall not\nbe issued before the proceeds of the cheque, pay order or demand\ndraft, as the case may be, are realized and the date of such certificates\nshall be date of encashment of the cheque, pay order or demand draft,\nas the case may be.\n8. Encashment of Certificate:-\n(1) A certificate of any denomination may be encashed any time after\nthe expiry of a period of five years from the date of issue by presenting\nit before the Post Office of issue.\n(2) Where a certificate of any denomination has been purchased on\nor after the 1st April, 1987, it may be encashed at any time after the\nexpiry of a period of five and half years from the date of issue by\npresenting it before the Post Office of issue.\n(2.A) Where a Certificate of any denomination has been purchased on\nor after the 1st March, 1988 it may be encashed at any time after the\nexpiry of a period of five years from the date of issue by presenting\nit before the Post Office of issue.\nProvided that a certificate may be encashed at any other Post\nOffice if the office-in-charge of that Post Office is satisfied on\nverification from the Post Office of issue that such certificate was\nissued by the said Post Office.\n9. Discharge of Certificate:-\nThe person presenting a certificate for encashment shall sign in\nthe space provided on the back thereof in token of having received\npayment and indicate thereon.”\n:\n1\n:\nCENTRAL GOVERNMENT OF INDIA 1. KRISHNAJI PARVETESH KULKARNI [PASAYAT, J.1931\nAccording to learned counsel for appellants sub-rule (2) of Rule 7 has A\nclear application to the facts of the case. Reliance was placed on a decision\nof the Delhi High Court where an identical issue was adjudicated in Civil Writ\nPetition No.1848 of 1992. In that case reliance was placed on Rule 57(10) of\nthe Post Office Savings Bank Manual Volume - II. It was held that lost, stolen,\nmutilated, defaced or destroyed IVPs cannot be replaced. It was pointed out\nB\nthat Rule 7(2) of the Rules was not taken note of, yet the decision is an\nauthority for the proposition that the lost, stolen, mutilated, defaced or\ndestroyed IVPs cannot be replaced.\nThere is no appearance on behalf of the respondents in either of the\nappeals.\nAn IVP is akin to an ordinary currency note. It bears no name of the\nholder. Just as a lost currency note cannot be replaced, similarly the question\nof replacing a lost IVP does not arise. Rule 7(2) makes the position clear that\na certificate lost, stolen, mutilated, defaced or destroyed beyond recognition\nwill not be replaced by any post office. Similar is the position as regards the\ncertificate which is either lost or stolen. Undisputedly there was no challenge\nto the legality of the Rule 7(2). In the absence of a challenge to the provision,\nany direction should not really have been given. It is fundamental that no\ndirection which is contrary to law can be given.\nC\nD\nTherefore, the impugned order in each appeal cannot be sustained. It\nE\nis, however, evident from the record in Civil Appeal No.4819 of 2000 the\nrespondent has been paid the amount pursuant to the direction given in the\nsuit as affirmed by the High Court. In the peculiar circumstances, the\nrespondent shall not be liable to refund the amount in the peculiar\ncircumstances of the case. So far as other appeal is concerned, if the appellants\nhave not made the payment, they shall not be liable to make payment. But\nF\nif the payment has already been made as in the case of Civil Appeal No. 4819\nof 2000 then no recovery shall be made.\nThis direction is being given in view of the statement made by leaned\ncounsel for the appellants that considering the small amount involved the\nappellant will not claim refund, but the position in law has to be set at rest G\nas large number of such claims are being made.\nThe appeals are allowed to the aforesaid extent but without any order\nas to costs.\nB.B.B.\nAppeals allowed.\nH\n"}
