High Court held that the charge of absence from B\nduty by the appellant, having been proved, the same would constitute a\nmisconduct. It issued writ of Quo Warranto holding that appointment of\nappellant as a member of Samiti was not legal. Hence the present appeal.\nAllowing the appeal, the Court\nC\nHELD: 1.1. The disqualification set down in Section 139(1)(f) of\nBihar Panchayat Raj Act, 1993 would be attracted when the requirements\nlaid down therein are fulfilled, which would mean that the elected\ncandidate should have been dismissed from service of the Central or State\nor other local authority (i) for commission of misconduct; and (ii) he has\nD\nbeen declared disqualified for employment in public service. [1063-B-C]\nI\n1.2.

The High Court did not go into the\ncorrectness or otherwise of the order of the State Election Commission.\nOn what premise the power of judicial review was exercised by the High\nCourt is not indicated.

For the said purpose it was\nobligatory on the part of the High Court to arrive at a finding that the\ndisqualifying clause contained in Section 139(1) (f) was squarely attracted\nin the case of the appellant, in the light of the order of the State Election\nCommission. Evidently, the appellant was not disqualified.\nB\nC\nᎠ\nE\n[1063-H; 1064-A|\nCIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 1551 of 2006.\nFrom the Judgment and Final Order dated 4.10.2004 of the Patna High\nCourt in C.W.J.C. No. 3205/2003.\nNeeraj Shekhar, S.S. Bandhyopadhyay, Ambhoj Kumar Sinha and Irshad\nAhmad for the Appellant.\nB.B. Singh, Akhilesh Kumar Pandey and Pavan Kumar for the\nRespondents.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nS.B. SINHA, J. Leave granted.\nThis appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 4.10.2004\npassed by a Division Bench of the Patna High Court in CWJC No. 3205/\n2003, whereby and whereunder the writ petition filed by the 6th respondent\nherein, questioning an order dated 29.1.2003 passed by the State Election\nCommission, was allowed. The basic facts are not in dispute. The appellant\nwas elected as a member of Nauhatta Panchayat Samiti from Ward No. 17,\nin that Panchayat in an unreserved seat in an election held on 11.4.2001. He\nwas granted an election certificate by the competent authority on 14.5.2001.\nF It is not in dispute that respondent No. 6 herein has filed an election petition\nG\nH\nin the Court of the Subordinate Judge, Saharsa, as Election Petition No. 6/\n2001, inter alia, praying for setting aside the declaration of the appellant\nherein as a member of Panchayat Samiti and for a declaration of himself as\nelected instead.\nIn the said election petition it was categorically stated that the O.P. No.\n2 was a Dafadar and he was discharged from his post for his illegal and\nirregular conduct and against the order of discharge, O.P. No. 2 filed a writ\npetition in the High Court of Patna and the same was dismissed. Indisputably\nthe said election petition is still pending.\nThe Legislature of the State of Bihar enacted Bihar Panchayat Raj Act,\nI\nARUN SINGH @ ARUN KUMAR SINGH v. STATE OF BIHAR [SINHA, J.] 1061\n1993. Section 139(1) (f) of the said Act reads thus:\n\"Disqualifications- (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in this\nAct, a person shall be disqualified for election or after election for\nholding the post as Mukhia, member of the Grampanchayat, Sarpanch,\nPanch of the Gram Katchahri, member of the Panchayat Samiti and\nmember of Zila Parishad, if such person:\n(a) ..\nA\nB\n(f) Has been dismissed from the service of Central or State\nGovernment or any local authority for misconduct and has been\ndeclared to be disqualified for employment in the public service;\" C\nThe Bihar Panchayat Election Rules were framed thereunder. Rule 122\nof the said Rules was amended on 28.2.2002, whereby and whereunder the\nState Election Commission was empowered to determine the question as to\nwhether a member of the Panchayat, at any level, had disqualified himself on\nany ground enumerated in various sub-clauses therein. Such a power could D\nbe exercised by the State Election Commission either suo muto or on the\nrelevant facts being brought to its notice.\nRule 122 of the said Rules reads as under:\n\"Rule 122: Under provisions of section 139(2) of the Bihar Panchayat E\nRaj Act; 1993, the State Election Commission shall be the competent\nauthority to decide whether a member of a Panchayat at any level has\nbecome subject to any of the disqualifications mentioned in section\n139(1) of the Act. The matter of disqualification may be brought to\nthe Commission in the form of a complaint, application or information\nby any person or authority. The State Election Commission also\nmay\ntake suo motu cognizance of such matters and decide such matters\nexpeditiously after allowing sufficient opportunity to the affected\nparties of being heard.\"\nIt is furthermore not in dispute that the State Election Commission at\nthe instance of respondent No. 6 considered the question as to whether the\nappellant herein stood disqualified having regard to the fact that the appellant\nwas dismissed from service. It is not in dispute that the appellant was appointed\nas a Dafadar in a temporary capacity. He was allegedly dismissed from\nservice by the Superintendent of Police, Saharsa, by an order dated 9.8.1980.\nF\nG\nH\nA\n1062\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2006] 2 S.C.R.\nRespondent No. 6, despite the fact that his election petition was pending\nin which the issue in question was whether the appellant herein stood\ndisqualified by reason of the order of dismissal dated 9.8.1990, filed an\napplication before the State Election Commission purported to be in terms of\nRule 122 of the Rules. By an order dated 29.1.2003 the said application was\ndismissed. The State Election Commission had noticed that the order of\ndismissal passed as against the appellant herein did not indicate that the same\nwas for commission of a misconduct. The District Magistrate appears to have\ntaken a view that as his appointment was illegal and as the likely appointment\nof his successor was illegal, the order of dismissal/discharge was justified in\nlaw. It was further noticed that the writ petition filed by the appellant herein\nC questioning the said order of the District Magistrate, as CWJC No. 10394/\n1996 was dismissed by the Patna High Court by order dated 27.2.1997.\nB\nD\n(I)\nE\nF\nIn his order the State Election Commissioner held:\n\"Report of the SP, Saharsa dated 24.01.2003 and G form No. 3/79\nof Nauhatta Police Station have been received. A perusal of these\ndocuments indicates that the OP has been removed from service for\nnot doing his duty properly. The Deputy Superintendent vide his\nendorsement dated 24.01.1980 on G Form No. 3/79 addressed to the\nSP has remarked that the OP may be discharged. Thus what appears\nfrom the relevant documents in that the OP who was appointed as\nDafadar for a temporary period was to be discharged from the job for\nnot doing his duty properly. The documents do not indicate any act\nof misconduct on the part of the OP and, therefore, the provisions of\nclause (f) of sub-section (1) of Section 139 of the Act is not attracted\nin this case.\"\nRespondent No. 6 filed a writ petition questioning the validity of the\nsaid order. The said writ petitioner was heard together with other writ petitions\nwherein the vires of Section 139(1) of the Act and Rule 122 were in question.\nA Division Bench of the High Court, upholding the validity of the said\nprovisions, opined that even though the writ applications filed against the\nG orders of the State Election Commissioner were maintainable, such elections\nwhich were vitiated by fraud cannot be allowed to stand. The High Court\nthereafter considered in brief the merit of each of the writ petitions filed\nbefore it. In regard to the writ petitions filed by respondent No. 6, it was\nopined that the Election Commission had taken an erroneous view in its order\nin so far as it failed to take into consideration that as the appellant herein had\nH\nabsented himself from duty and the said allegation had been proved, the same\n•\n'\nARUN SINGH @ ARUN KUMAR SINGH v. STATE OF BIHAR [SINHA, J.] 1063\nwould constitute a misconduct. On that premise, a writ of quo warranto was A\ndirected to be issued and a further declaration was made that the appointment\nof the appellant as a member of the Panchayat Samiti was not legal and valid\nand he cannot continue to function as such. We cannot agree with the findings\nof the High Court.\nSection 139(1) (f) of the Act which provides for a disqualification,\nmust be construed strictly. The disqualification set down in Section 139(1) (f)\nwould be attracted when the requirements laid down therein are fulfilled,\nwhich would mean that the elected candidate should have been dismissed\nfrom service of the Central or State or other local authority (i) for commission\nof misconduct; and (ii) he has been declared disqualified for employment in\npublic service.\nB\nC\nThe State Election Commissioner in his order noticed that the order of\ndismissal passed as against the appellant herein did not indicate that the same\nwas for any misconduct committed by him, the order of the District Magistrate\nrevealed that his services were dispensed with only because his appointment D\nwas found to be illegal whereas the order passed by the Superintendent of\nPolice indicated that the appellant had been dismissed/removed from service\nfor not doing his work properly. No finding of fact was arrived at either by\nthe Superintendent of Police or the District Magistrate or for that matter, by\nthe State Election Commissioner that prior to the issuance of the said letter,\na disciplinary proceeding was initiated against the appellant and he was found\nto have committed any misconduct within the meaning of the provisions of\nthe Bihar Civil Services Classification Appeal Rules or otherwise.\nE\nF\nThe order imposing penalty was not before the High Court. There was\nnothing to show that the said order fulfilled the conditions precedent for\ninvoking the provisions of Section 139(1) (f) of the Act. The High Court\ntherefore, in our opinion, completely misdirected itself in holding that as the\nappellant had absented himself from duty the same constituted misconduct\nand thus his election was void. The High Court did not go into the correctness\nor otherwise of the order of the State Election Commission. On what premise\nthe power of judicial review was exercised by the High Court is not indicated. G\nNo cogent or sufficient reasons have been given by the High Court for setting\naside the well considered order of the State Election Commission. Furthermore,\nissuance of a writ of quo warranto is discretionary and such a writ should be\nissued only upon a clear finding that the appointment to a public office was\ncontrary to the statute. For the said purpose it was obligatory on the part of\nH\n1064\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2006] 2 S.C.R.\nA the High Court to arrive at a finding that the disqualifying clause contained\nin section 139(1) (f) was squarely attracted in the case of the appellant, in the\nlight of the order of the State Election Commission. Evidently, the appellant\nwas not disqualified.\nFor the foregoing reasons the impugned judgment cannot be sustained\nB and it is accordingly set aside. The appeal is allowed. In the facts and\ncircumstances of the case, respondent No. 6 shall bear the costs of this\nappeal. Counsel fee is assessed as Rs. 5,000.\nK.K.T.\nAppeal allowed.\n"}
