SINHA AND MARKANDEY KATJU, JJ.]\nB\nPenal Code, 1860; Ss. 34 \u0026 302/Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973;\nS. 313:\nMurder-Right to private defence-Held: Accused allegedly gave a\nlathi blow and a pharsi blow on the head of the deceased-A pharsis causes\nan incised wound, however, no incised wound found on the body of the\ndeceased as is evident from the post mortem report-Thus, there is a clear\ninconsistency between ocular version and medical version-Accused admitting\nC\nthat they did attack the deceased but they did so in their self-defence- D\nProsecution failed to explain the injury on the accused -Non-explanation\nof injuries is certainly an important circumstance which has to be taken into\nconsideration by the Court while deciding that benefit of doubt should go\nto the accused-Statement of accused as recorded under Section 313 as used\nin self-defence certainly throws reasonable doubt upon the entire prosecution\nversion-Hence, the benefit of doubt has to be given to the accused- E\nDirections issued.\nAccording to the prosecution, on 5.8.1990, the complainant, PW 10 and\nanother were smoking “huqqa”, in front of the baithak of one 'S'. In the\nafternoon, when the deceased was returning in his house after grazing\nF\nbuffaloes and reached in front of 'P's house, accused persons armed with\npharsi and lathi respectively threatened him with dire consequences for\nsuspecting them as the thieves of buffaloes. One of them gave a pharsi blow\nand another gave a lathi blow on the head of the deceased, and he fell on the\nground. But the accused continuously gave 2-3 more lathi blows which hit\nhim on his back. Seeing this, PW 9, PW 10 and another person reached the G\nspot and rescued the victim from the clutches of accused. In the rescuing\nprocess, one of the accused also received injuries. The accused thereafter\nfled away from the spot with their respective weapons. The victim was taken\nto a Hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries. On receipt of the\n757\nH\nA\n758\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 5 S.C.R.\nA information, a Sub-Inspector of Police reached the hospital and sent the dead-\nbody of the victim for post-mortem examination. A case against the appellants\nwas registered vide formal FIR. Later, accused were arrested, and in\npursuance of disclosure statement, weapons used in committing the crime\nwere recovered. After completion of investigation, charge-sheet against the\naccused persons was filed by the Police. Trial Court found both the accused\nguilty of offence under Section 302 read with Section 34 I.P.C and sentenced\nthem to life imprisonment. Appeal filed against the judgment of the trial Court\nwas dismissed by the High Court. Hence the present appeal.\nB\nC\nOn behalf of the accused-appellant, it was contended that admittedly one\nof the accused caused the injury on the back of the deceased with a jelly and\nanother accused was not present; that the injuries on the person of the deceased\nwas a self-defence; that the report of the local commissioner clearly reveals\nthat it was not possible for the eye witnesses to have seen the occurrence\nwhile sitting at the place as mentioned as the place of occurrence; that there\nis a clear contradiction between the eye witnesses and the medical evidence;\nD that the delay in lodging the FIR also shows that it is a concocted false story;\nthat the injuries on the person of the accused are totally unexplained by the\nprosecution and they are in conformity with the defence version; that the\nmotive attributed to the accused was stale and the theft of buffalo of deceased\nand another was only the suspicion which had taken place a long time back\nand was no reason to commit a serious crime as murder; and that the FIR is\nthe result of consultation and deliberation as the special report was received\nby the Magistrate at 6.55 p.m. even though his residence is only 100 yards\nfrom the police station.\nE\nF\nG\nAllowing the appeal, the Court\nHELD: 1.1. In this case the benefit of doubt has to be given to the accused\nand it is possible that it is a case of bona fide self-defence. [Para 18] [764-F]\n1.2. In the FIR, it has been stated that one of the accused gave a pharsi\nblow on the head of the deceased while another accused gave a lathi blow on\nhis head. The same is the statements in Court of the alleged eye witnesses\nPW 9 and PW 10. A pharsi is a weapon which causes an incised wound like\nan axe. However, there is no incised would on the body of the deceased as is\nevident from the post mortem report. There are four injuries on the dead body\nof the deceased as found in the post mortem report. One of these wounds was\na lacerated wound on the head while the other wounds are contusions on the\nH shoulder. There is no incised wound. Thus, there is a clear inconsistency\nRAJ PAL v. STATE OF HARYANA\nbetween the ocular version and the medical version. [Para 11] [764-C-E]\n759\nA\n1.3. The prosecution version is that the pharsi was used lathi wise by\nits blunt edge. It seems to be a tutored version when the prosecution realized\nthat there was a clear inconsistency between the ocular version and the\nmedical version. In fact in his statement, PW 9 stated that he did not state to\nthe police in his statement under Section 161 Cr.PC that the pharsi blow was B\ngiven lathi wise. Thus, his statement in the court appears to be a clear\nimprovement over the statement given to the police. [Para 12] [762-F]\n1.4. Another contradiction between the ocular version and the medical\nversion is that according to the FIR version and deposition of the eye witnesses\nbefore the trial court two blows were given on the head of the deceased by the C\naccused persons. However, in the post mortem report only one injury (lacerated\nwound) was found on the head of the deceased. [Para 13] [762-G-H]\n2.1. While there is no absolute rule that merely because the prosecution\nhas failed to explain the injuries on the accused ipso facto the prosecution\ncase should be thrown out, the non-explanation of the injuries on the accused D\nis certainly an important circumstance which has to be taken into\nconsideration by the Court in deciding whether the benefit of doubt should go\nto the accused. [Para 20] [764-G-H; 765-A]\nBishna v. State of West Bengal, [2005] 12 SCC 657, relied on.\nE\n2.2. The injuries on the accused include an injury on the head, which\nis a vital part of the body. Ordinarily self-inflicted injuries are on non-vital\nparts. The injury on the head of the accused required stitches. It is difficult\nto believe that this was self-inflicted. Moreover, in the present case, there are\nvery important discrepancies in the prosecution version. It is true that minor\nF\ndiscrepancies will not necessarily lead to the rejection of the prosecution case,\nbut when there are major discrepancies and unexplained injuries on the\naccused it is an important factor to be taken into account.\n[Para 21] [765-B-C]\n2.3. In their statements under Section 313 Cr.PC, the accused persons G\naccepted that they did attack the deceased but said that they did so in their\nself-defence. In these statements the accused pleaded innocence and false\nimplication by the witnesses. Further, one of the accused has stated that the\ndeceased had forcibly opened a door towards his plot. Since he opposed this\nthere was a quarrel on this issue. Thereupon the deceased and another\nattacked him and he tried to run away, but they overpowered him near the H\n760\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 5 S.C.R.\nA house of one ‘P' where he picked up a jelly and used it in his self-defence.\n[Paras 14 and 22] [763-A-B; 765-C-D]\n2.4. Though it cannot be said that the version of the accused is\nnecessarily correct, but it certainly throws a reasonable doubt upon the entire\nprosecution version when it is coupled with other circumstances. Thus, benefit\nB of doubt has to be given to the appellants. [Paras 23 and 24] [765-E-F]\n2007.\nCRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION : Criminal Appeal No. 639 of\nFrom the Judgment and Order dated 8.12.2005 of the High Court of\nC Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh in Crl. A. No. 67-DB 1997.\nD\nK.B. Sinha, Kawaljit Kochar and Kusum Chaudhary for the Appellants.\nRajeev Gaur 'Naseem' and T.V. George for the Respondent.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMARKANDEY KATJU, J. Leave granted.\n1. This appeal has been filed against the impugned judgment dated\n8.12.2005 passed by the Punjab \u0026 Haryana High Court in Criminal Appeal No.\nE 67-DB/1997.\n2. Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record.\n3. The prosecution case is that Raj Pal and Jai Pal appellants are\nbrothers inter-se, being sons of Hari Chand. A panchayat was held in the\nF village, in the month of February 1990, in connection with the theft of buffaloes\nof Yad Ram. Hira Lal complainant, Karan Singh, and Kure Ram had also\nattended the Panchayat, in which Sohan Lal (@ Melha) deceased, who was\nuncle of Yad Ram, had suspected the appellants to be the thieves. It is alleged\nthat since then the appellants had been nourishing a grudge against Sohan\nLal.\nG\n4. On 5.8.1990, Hira Lal complainant, PW 10 Zile Singh and one Diwan\nSingh were smoking “huqqa”, in front of the baithak of Shadi Lal. At about\n1.00 p.m. Sohan Lal was returning to his house after grazing buffaloes in his\nfields. When he reached in front of Parshadi's house, Jai Pal and Raj Pal\nH appellants who were armed with pharsi and lathi respectively came near him\nRAJ PAL v. STATE OF HARYANA [MARKANDEY KATJU, J.] 761\nB\nand said that they would teach him a lesson for suspecting them as the A\nthieves of buffaloes. Jai Pal then gave a pharsi blow and Raj Pal gave a lathi\nblow on Sohan Lal's head. He fell on the ground. Even in fallen condition,\nRaj Pal gave 2-3 more lathi blows which hit him on his back. Seeing this, Hira\nLal (PW 9), Zile Singh (PW 10), and Diwan Singh reached the spot and\nrescued Sohan Lal from the clutches of appellants. In the rescuing process,\nJai Pal also received injuries. The appellants, thereafter, fled away from the\nspot with their respective weapons. Zile Singh and Surender son of Hans Lal\nremoved Sohan Lal (injured) from the spot, in a car, to the General Hospital,\nGurgaon, where he succumbed to his injuries. On receipt of this information,\nin the form of medical ruqqa, Ex. PA, about the death of Sohan Lal, Sub-\nInspector Suraj Bhan reached the hospital, where Hira Lal complainant and C\nBis Ram were found sitting near the dead-body of Sohan Lal. He recorded the\nstatement of Hira Lal, Ex. PH, and sent it to the police station with his\nendorsement, Ex.PH/1, thereon, on which the case against the appellants was\nregistered vide formal FIR, Ex PH/2. He prepared inquest report, Ex. PL, and\nsent the dead-body for post-mortem examination. He visited the place of\noccurrence, prepared rough site plan thereof, Ex. PM, and also called the\nphotographer who took photographs, Exs. P3 and P4 (negatives Exs. Pl and\nP2), of the scene of occurrence. He also took into possession blood-stained\nearth from there vide memo, Ex. PN, after making it into a sealed parcel. He\nsearched for the appellants but could arrest them only on 10.8.1990, as earlier\nthey remained absconding. On 12.8.1990, Raj Pal appellant got a lathi recovered\nin pursuance of his disclosure statement. Ex. PO, and the same was taken into\npossession vide memo, Ex.PO/1. Similarly, Jai Pal appellant also got recovered\na ‘pharsi' in pursuance of his disclosure statement, Ex. PP, and the same too,\nwas taken into possession vide memo, Ex. PP/1.\nD\nE\n5. After completion of investigation, challan was filed in court against F\nthe appellants by Inspector Jag Parvesh PW5.\n6. On receipt of the case, by way of commitment, the trial court charged\nthe appellants under Section 302 read with Section 34 I.P.C. and since they\npleaded not guilty, the case was committed for trial.\n7. The witnesses examined by the prosecution, in support of their case,\nare PW 1 Dr. B.M. Bhatnagar, PW 2 Dr. Sushil Goyal, PW 3 Mool Chand\nPunia, PW 4 Balwant Rai Bhatia, PW 5 Inspector Jag Parvesh, PW 6 Constable\nMaheshswar, PW 7 Jai Singh, PW 8 Head Constable Murari Lal, PW 9 Hira\nLal, PW 10 Zile Singh and PW 11 Sub-Inspector Suraj Bhan.\nG\nH\nA\n762\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 5 S.C.R.\n8. After consideration of the evidence on record the trial court by its\njudgment dated 7.12.1996 found the appellant Raj Pal and Jai Pal guilty of\noffence under Section 302 read with Section 34 I.P.C and sentenced them to\nlife imprisonment.\n9. Against the said judgment the accused filed an appeal before the\nB High Court which was dismissed by the impugned judgment, and hence this\nappeal.\nC\nD\n10. We have carefully perused the evidence and material on record and\nwe are of the opinion that the benefit of doubt has to be given to the accused.\n11. In this connection it may be mentioned that in the FIR dated 5.8.1990\nit has been stated that the accused Jai Pal gave a pharsi blow on the head\nof Sohan Lal while Rajpal gave a lathi blow on his head. The same is the\nstatements in Court of the alleged eye witnesses PW 9 Hira Lal and PW 10\nZile Singh. A pharsi is a weapon which causes an incised wound like an axe.\nHowever, there is no incised wound on the body of Sohan Lal as is evident\nfrom the post mortem report. There are four injuries on the dead body of\nSohan Lal as found by Dr. Sushil Goyal's post mortem report conducted on\n5.8.1990 at 6.05 p.m. One of these wounds was a lacerated wound on the head\nwhile the other wounds are contusions on the shoulder. There is no incised\nwound. Thus, there is a clear inconsistency between the ocular version and\nE the medical version.\nF\nG\n12. The prosecution version is that the pharsi was used lathi wise by\nits blunt edge. It seems to us that this appears to be a tutored version when\nthe prosecution realized that there was a clear inconsistency between the\nocular version and the medical version. In fact in his statement in Court PW\n9 Hira Lal stated that he did not state to the police in his statement under\nSection 161 Cr.PC that the pharsi blow was given lathi wise. Thus, his statement\nin the court appears to be a clear improvement over the statement given to\nthe police. As regards the other witness PW 10 Zile Singh, he has not stated\nin his evidence that the pharsi blow was given to Sohan Lal lathi wise.\n13. Another contradiction between the ocular version and the medical\nversion is that according to the FIR version and deposition of the eye\nwitnesses before the trial court two blows were given on the head of Sohan\nLal, a pharsi blow by Jai Pal and a lathi blow by Raj Pal. However, in the post\nmortem report only one injury (lacerated wound) was found on the head of\nH Sohan Lal.\nRAJ PAL v. STATE OF HARYANA [MARKANDEY KATJU, J.]\n763\n14. In their statements under Section 313 Cr.PC the accused Jai Pal and A\nRaj Pal accepted that they did attack Sohan Lal but said that they did so in\ntheir self-defence. In these statements the accused pleaded innocence and\nfalse implication by the witnesses. They stated that a wrestling bout had\ntaken place in their village on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan in the year\n1989. Wrestlers of Rohtak and Bandhwari had opposed each other, at that time\nB\nHansraj Sarpanch was married in the village Bandhwari and he had sided with\nthe wrestlers of that village whereas in fact they were not winning. Rajpal\nused to organize that wrestling bout with the help of villagers, and at that\ntime, he, Hira Lal, Diwan Singh, Zile Singh and Karan Singh had a wordy duel.\nRaj Pal was telling that wrestlers of Rohtak had won whereas they were\nopposing them and on that account they have been falsely implicated in this C\ncase. Aforesaid Hans Raj, Diwan Singh, Hira Lal, Zile Singh and Karan Singh\nbelong to different parties. Ram Chand is also stated to be their companion\nand was always opposed to them.\nE\n15. Jai Pal accused further elaborated in his 313 Cr.PC statement that\nRam Chander had forcibly opened a door towards his plot. He opposed it, and D\nhence they quarreled on that issue also. Ram Chander, Sohan Lal, Karan\nSingh came there with lathis and opened attack on him. He ran away but they\noverpowered him near the house of Parshadi. He then picked up a three\npronged jelly from that place and used it in self-defence. A blow of his jelly\nhit the back of Sohan Lal. He fell down. A brick was lying on the ground.\nThe peg for tethering cattle (Khunta) was also in existence at that place. Since\nSohan Lal fell down he got a chance and escaped therefrom. The police\narrested him, his brother and his father on the evening of 5th of August 1990.\nHe narrated the incident to the police. Despite that, the police implicated him\nfalsely. He had sufficient injuries in this accident but the police did not «.\narrange for his Medico Legal Report till 10th of August 1990. The police even F\ndid not produce them in the Court. Only on the application moved by his\nbrother Shiv Raj, they were produced in the Court. The entire prosecution\ncase is false and concocted. If one is sitting on the chabutra of Shadi Lal,\nthen the house of Parshadi Lal was not visible and this proves that Raj Pal,\nand his brother were not present, at all, at the time of the aforesaid incident.\n16. In their defence evidence the accused examined DW-1 Dr. S.P. Singh.\nHe stated that on 18.8.1990 at about 8.00 p.m. he medically examined Jai Pal\nand found the following injuries on his person :-\n(1) Already dissected and stitched wound, over the left parietal\nG\nH\n764\nA\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 5 S.C.R.\neminence, length 1-1/4\".\nB\nC\n(2) Complaint of pain back. No mark of external injury was seen.\nThere was no swelling.\n(3) Complaint of pain left calf, muscles. There was no mark of external\ninjury. There was no swelling.\nLearned counsel for the appellant has submitted that Jai Pal, the appellant has\nhonestly admitted that he caused the injury on the back of the deceased with\na jelly and his brother Raj Pal was not present. He submitted that the injuries\non the person of Jai Pal was in self-defence. He further submitted that the\nreport of the local commissioner clearly reveals that it was not possible the\nfor eye\nwitnesses Hira Lal and Zile Singh to have seen the occurrence while\nsitting at the place in front of Shadi Lal's Baithak as the place of occurrence,\nthat is the house of Prashadi Lal, is not visible from there. He further submitted\nthat there is a clear contradiction between eye the witnesses and the medical\nevidence (details of which have already been mentioned above). The delay\nD in lodging the FIR also shows that it is a concocted false story. The injuries\non the person of Jai Pal are totally unexplained by the prosecution and they\nare in conformity with the defence version.\n17. Learned counsel further stated that the motive attributed to the\naccused was stale and the theft of buffalo of Yad Ram and Sohan Lal was\nE only a the suspicion which had taken place a long time back and was no\nF\nreason to commit a serious crime as murder. Learned counsel further submitted\nthat the FIR is the result of consultation and deliberation. The special report\nwas received by the Illaqa Magistrate at 6.55 p.m. even though his residence\nis only 100 yards from the police station.\n18. We are of the opinion that in this case the benefit of doubt has to\nbe given to the accused and it is possible that it is a case of bona fide self-\ndefence.\n19. In Bishna v. State of West Bengal, [2005] 12 SCC 657 one of us (Hon.\nS.B. Sinha, J) have discussed in great detail the law of private defence and\nG\nthe effect of non-explanation by the prosecution of the injuries on the accused.\n·H\n20. While there is no absolute rule that merely because the prosecution\nhas failed to explain the injuries on the accused ipso facto the prosecution\ncase should be thrown out, the non-explanation of the injuries on the accused\nis certainly an important circumstance which has to be taken into consideration\nRAJ PAL v. STATE OF HARYANA [MARKANDEY KATJU, J.]\n765\nby the Court in deciding whether the benefit of doubt should go to the A\naccused. In Bishna's case (supra) the entire law on the point has been\ndiscussed in great detail, and hence it is unnecessary to repeat it here.\n21. The injuries on the accused include an injury on the head, which\nis a vital part of the body. Ordinarily self-inflicted injuries are on non-vital\nparts. The injury on the head of the accused Jai Pal required stitches. It is B\ndifficult to believe that this was self-inflicted. Moreover, in the present case,\nas noticed above, there are very important discrepancies in the prosecution\nversion. It is true that minor discrepancies will not necessarily lead to the\nrejection of the prosecution case, but when there are major discrepancies and\nunexplained injuries on the accused it is an important factor to be taken into\nC\naccount.\n22. In his statement under Section 313 Cr.PC, Jai Pal has stated that Ram\nChander had forcibly opened a door towards his plot. Since Jai Pal opposed\nthis there was a quarrel on this issue. Thereupon Ram Chander, Sohan Lal and\nKaran Singh attacked Jai Pal and he tried to run away, but they overpowered D\nhim near the house of Parshadi where he picked up a jelly and used it in his\nself-defence.\n23. While we are not in a position to say that the version of Jai Pal is\nnecessarily correct, it certainly throws a reasonable doubt upon the entire\nprosecution version when it is coupled with other circumstances (such as E\nmajor discrepancies between the ocular version and the medical evidence)\nwhich have already been referred to above.\n24. In view of the above discussion, we are of the opinion that the\nbenefit of doubt has to be given to the appellants. The appeal is allowed. The\nimpugned judgments of the trial court and the High Court are set aside. The\nappellants shall be released forthwith unless required in some other case.\nS.K.S.\nAppeal allowed.\nF\n"}
