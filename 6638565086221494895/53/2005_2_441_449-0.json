Section Note (SN-6) specifically provides that\nChapters 52 to 55 would not apply to “made up” goods. It would logically\nfollow that they would therefore apply to non-made up goods. Paragraph\n(a) of CN-6 deals with “textile products in the piece, cut to length or simply\n441\nH\nའག\n442\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2005] 2 S.C.R.\nA cut to rectangular (including square) shape (other than those having the\ncharacter of the products of heading numbers 59.07 and 59.08)”.\" From\nthis, read with SN-5 and 6, it is inferred that the context of Tariff Heading\n59.09 requires that it would apply to ‘made up' goods. Running lengths\nof unprocessed textiles or non-made up goods therefore would not be\ncovered by this paragraph. The language of Tariff Heading 59.09 itself\nshows that it refers to articles and products other thân articles referred\nto in the Chapter.-There is a distinction between articles and products on\nthe one hand and textile fabrics on the other hand.\nB\nC\n|447-B-C÷D, G-H; 448-A].-\nJyoti Overseas Ltd..v: CCE, Indore, (2001) 130 ELT.446, approved...\n2.

Applying\nthe Rules of interpretation particularly Rule 1 of the Rules, it can be said\nthat the reasoning of a larger Bench of the Tribunal in the case of Jyoti\nOverseas is unexceptionable and, therefore the decision in the case of\nSimplex Mills Co.

The respondent is engaged in the manufacture of\nTextiles, namely; grey cotton canvas cloth, hundred percent cotton/grey cotton,\nbelting and duck. The issue to be resolved is whether these goods are\nclassifiable under Tariff Headings (TH) 52.02, 54.08 or 59.09 of the Schedule\nto the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985. The appellant contends that they are D\nclassifiable under TH 59.09. The respondent on the other hand cleared the\ngoods classifying them either under TH 52.02 or 54.08. Consequently on\n23rd September, 1992 24 show cause notices were issued by the Excise\nAuthorities to the respondent to show cause why differential duty amounting\nto Rs. 545,10,838 should not be recovered against the clearances effected\nduring the period 20.7.1987 to 13.8.1992. The respondent showed cause. The\nAssistant Collector confirmed the demand on the basis of an earlier decision\nof the Central Excise and Gold Control Appellate Tribunal (CEGAT) in .he\nrespondent's own case reported as Simplex Mills Co. Ltd. v. CCE Nagpur, in\n(1993) 49 ECR 147 (referred to as 'Simplex I').\nSimplex-I had rejected the respondent's submission that grey belting\ncloth or canvas cloth which were manufactured by it were classifiable under\nTH 52.05 or 54.08.

It was held that TH\n1\n:\nC.C.E. v. SIMPLEX MILLS CO. LTD. [RUMA PAL, J.]\n445\n59.09 was a specific entry which dealt with fabrics for industrial use and A\nsince the respondent marketed their products admittedly for industrial use,\nthe other entries in Chapters 52 and 54 would not apply. It was further held\nconstruing CN-6 that if the article is covered by 59.09 then it was excluded\nfrom Chapters 52 to 56. A number of authorities were referred to for coming\nto the conclusion that the items manufactured by the respondent were industrial\nfabrics. Reference was also made to the HSN explanatory notes which,\naccording to the Tribunal supported their view.\nB\nIn the meanwhile, not only had the respondent challenged the decision\nof CEGAT in Simplex I before this Court but also on 5th November, 1993,\nan order was issued by the Central Board of Excise and Customs under C\nSection 37-B of the Central Excise and Salt Act, 1944 (as it stood then)\nclarifying that grey cotton canvas, cotton ducks, cotton tyre cord fabrics and\ncotton belting fabrics would thenceforth be classified under TH No. 52.05.\nAccording to the respondent in view of this circular it did not press its appeal\nbefore this Court which was accordingly dismissed for non-prosecution on\nD\n3rd November, 1995. This prompted the Central Board of Excise in Customs\nto examine the matter afresh and issue an order on 30th June, 1997 in\nsupersession of the 37-B circular dated 5.11.1993 that :-\nA. grey cotton tyre cord fabrics, grey, belting cloth, grey filter cloth/\nstraining cloth and grey belting cloth and belting duck, generally\nhaving technical uses and generally not used for making clothing,\nhousehold linen, bedspreads, curtains, other furnishing articles,\netc. shall henceforth be classified under heading No. 59.11 of the\nCET;\nE\nB.\nthe grey cotton canvas and grey cotton duck, not having technical\nuses, shall henceforth be classified under chapter 52 of CET; and\nF\nC.\nthe grey cotton belting shall henceforth be classified under heading\n59.10 subject to note 6 to Chapter 59.\"\nThe 1997 Circular virtually reproduced the decision in Simplex I which had\nheld that the respondents' goods were correctly classifiable under TH 59.09. G\n(subsequently numbered as 59.11).\nRelying on Simplex-I, the Commissioner (Appeals) dismissed the\nrespondents' appeal and the demand for differential duty was confirmed.\nSubsequent to this, the decision in Simplex-I was overruled by a larger bench\nof CEGAT in Jyoti Overseas Ltd. v. CCE, Indore, (2001) 130 ELT 446. The\nH\nB\n446\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2005] 2 S.C.R.\nA larger bench decision in. Jyoti Overseas Ltd. v. Commissioner of Central\nExcise, Indore (supra) in overruling Simplex-I held (1) only “made up\" articles\ncan be classified.under. Chapters 59.09. The department's case there as well\nas in the case before us was not that the cotton fabrics manufactured by the\nrespondent/assessee were in any manner made up, nor was it in dispute that\nthe goods were woven fabrics of more than 85% by weight of cotton.. The\ngoods were in running-length not cut to size or processed; 2) Tariff heading\n59.09 was a residuary heading so that if goods manufactured by appellants\nfall in any other heading of Section XI it cannot be classified under Chapter\nheading 59:09; 3) textile products or textile articles as referred to in 59.09\nwere not textile fabrics. Only something made out the fabrics would be\nC termed as textile products or textile articles. Therefore, unprocessed textile\nfabrics do not fall within 59.09 (now 59:11); 4) De hors the items contemplated.\nby Chapter Note.6 (now -7) to Chapter 59, no articles could be classified\nunder heading 59.09. Following the decision in Jyoti Overseas the CEGAT\nby the order impugned in this appeal set aside the order of the Commissioner\n(Appeals). The question is was Jyoti Overseas right in overruling Simplex I?\nD\nE\n(1)\nF\nG\nH\nThe three Chapters, namely; Chapters 52, 54 and 59 are contained in\nSection XI of the Central Excise:Tariff. At the relevant time, Section-Note\n5 defined the word “made up\" for the purposes of the entire Section as\nmeaning -\n(a) Cut otherwise than into squares or rectangles;\n(b) Produced in the finished state, ready for use (or merely needing\nseparation by cutting dividing threads) without sewing or other\nworking (for example, certain dusters, towels, table cloths, scarf\nsquares, blankets);\n(c) Hemmed or with'rolled edges, or with a knotted fringe at any of\nthe edges, but excluding fabrics, the cut edges of which have\nbeen prevented from unraveling by whipping or by other simple\nmeans;\n(d) Cut to size and having undergone a process of drawn thread\nwork;\n(e) Assembled by sewing, gumming or otherwise (other than piece\ngoods consisting of two or more lengths of identical material\njoined end to end and piece goods composed of two or more.\ntextiles assembled in layers, whether or not padded);\nI\nFWM\nC.C.E. v. SIMPLEX MILLS CO. LTD. [RUMA PAL. J.]\n447\n(f) Knitted or crocheted to shape, presented in the form of a number A\nof items in the length\".\nC\n\"Non made up\" goods would, therefore, cover running lengths of textiles,\nunprocessed in the manner specified in the Section Note. Section Note (SN)\n-6 specifically provides that Chapter 52 to 55 would not apply to \"made up\"\ngoods. It would logically follow that they would therefore apply to non-made B\nup goods According to SN-6 Chapters 56 to 60 unless the context so required\nwould also not apply to \"made up \" goods and Chapters 50 to 55 would not\napply to goods of Chapters 56 to 59. Chapter Note (CN)-6 of Chapter 59\nclarifies that Heading No. 59.09 applies to specific goods as enumerated in\nparagraphs (a) and (b) thereof, which do not fall in any other heading of\nSection XI. It follows that (1) unless the goods fall under paragraphs (a) or\n(b), they would not be covered by TH 59.09 and (2) that TH 59.09 is the\nresiduary heading to cover all the enumerated goods provided they do not fall\nin any other heading of Section XI. Paragraph (a) of CN-6 deals with \"textile\nproducts in the piece, cut to length or simply cut to rectangular (including\nsquare) shape (other than those having the character of the products of heading D\nnumbers 59.07 and 59.08)\". From this, read with SN-5 and 6, we may infer\nthat the context of TH 59.09 requires that it apply to 'made.up' goods.\nRunning lengths of unprocessed textiles or non made up goods therefore\nwould not be covered by this paragraph.\nParagraph 'b' of SN-6 also pertains to \"textile articles (other than those E\nof heading principles 59.07 and 59.08) of a kind used for technical purposes\n[for example textile fabrics and felts, endless or fitted with linking devices,\nof a kind used in paper making or similar machines (for example, for pulp\nor asbestos cement), gaskets, washers, polishing discs and other machinery\nparts]\".\n:\nF\nThis paragraph of CN-6 also indicates that it refers to 'made up' or\nprocessed goods and therefore running lengths or bolts of unprocessed fabric\nare not covered by TH 59.09. \"Endless felts\" contrary to what was assumed\nin Simplex I is not a running length of fabric, but a product with no end such\nas a completed circular length which being without an end or beginning G\nwould be endless. TH 59.09 deals with textile 'articles' and not textile fabrics\nas wrongly assumed in Simplex I. Examples of textile articles may be found\nin TH 59.07 and 59.08 such as textile hose-piping, transmission or conveyor\nbelts or belting. The language of TH 59.09 itself shows that it refers to\narticles and products other than articles referred to in the Chapter. There is\nH\n448\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2005] 2 S.C.R.\nA a distinction between articles and products on the one hand and textile fabrics\non the other hand as held in Jyoti Overseas.\nB\nThe rules for the interpretation of the Schedule to the Central Excise\nTariff Act, 1985 have been framed pursuant to the powers under Section 2\nof that Act. According to Rule 1 titles of Sections and Chapters in the Schedule\nare provided for ease of reference only. But for legal purposes, classification\n“shall be determined according to the terms of the headings and any relevant\nsection or Chapter Notes\". If neither the heading nor the notes suffice to\nclarify the scope of a heading, then it must be construed according to the\nother following provisions contained in the Rules. [Rule-I gives primacy to\nthe Section and Chapter Notes along with terms of the headings. They should\nbe first applied.] If no clear picture emerges then only can one resort to the\nsubsequent rules. The appellants have relied upon Rule 3. Rule 3 must be\nunderstood only in the context of sub-rule (b) of Rule 2 which says inter alia\nthat the classification of goods consisting of more than one material or\nsubstance shall be according to the principles contained in Rule 3. Therefore\nD when goods are prima facie, classifiable under two or more headings,\nclassification shall be effected according to sub-rules (a), (b) and (c) of Rule\n3 and in that order. The sub rules are quoted :-\nC\nE\nF\nG\nH.\n(a) The heading which provides the most specific description shall\nbe preferred to heading providing a more general description.\nHowever when two or more headings each refer to part only of\nthe materials or substances contained in mixed or composite goods\nor to part only of the items in a set, those headings are to be\nregarded as equally specific in relation to those goods, even if\none of them gives a more complete or precise description of the\ngoods.\n(b) Mixtures, composite goods consisting of different materials or\nmade up of different components, and goods put up in sets,\nwhich cannot be classified by reference to (a), shall be classified\nas if they consisted of the material or component which gives\nthem their essential character, insofar as this criterion is applicable.\n(c) When goods cannot be classified by reference to (a) or (b), they\nshall be classified under the heading which occurs last in the\nnumerical order among those which equally merit consideration.\"\nApplying the Rules of interpretation particularly Rule 1, we are of the\nY\n'\nC.C.E. v. SIMPLEX MILLS CO. LTD. [RUMA PAL, J.]\n449\nopinion that the reasoning of the Tribunal in Jyoti Overseas is unexceptionable A\nand in our opinion the decision in Simplex-I was correctly overruled.\nFinally it appears that in respect of other years, the Tribunal had taken\nthe same view as has been taken by it in the order impugned in these appeals\nand classified the respondent's products under Chapters 52 and 54. No appeal\nhas been preferred from those decisions by the Revenue and the finding for B\nthose years remain unchallenged.\ncosts.\nS.K.S.\nFor these reasons, the appeals are dismissed without any order as to\nAppeals dismissed.
