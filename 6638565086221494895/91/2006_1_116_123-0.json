SINHA AND P.P. NAOLEKAR, JJ.]\nCode of Civil Procedure, 1908-Section 11--Decision not challenged in\nappeal-Effect of Held: It attained finality and was binding on all-Doctrine\nof res judicata would therefore apply-Parties cannot raise the same issue\nonce again--Doctrines-Doctrine of res judicata.\nSome of the government employees were aggrieved by the 1984\nGradation list and made representation against it before the State of\nOrissa. The State issued Circular dated 21.2.1984 for fresh guidelines and\nconsequently published the corrected Gradation List on 22.8.1990. This\nwas challenged before the Tribunal which vide Order dated 9.3.1992\nquashed the corrected Gradation list and upheld the validity of 1984\nGradation List. The correctness of this order was not questioned by the\nState and the applicants. Thereafter, State issued a Circular dated\n12.8.1992 incorporating the terms of the order of the Tribunal. Meanwhile,\nE appellant had filed SLP challenging the order of Tribunal. In view of\nCircular dated 12.8.1992, this Court on 5.1.1993 dismissed the SLP as\ninfructuous and granted liberty to the appellant to pursue appropriate\nremedy. Thereafter, appellant filed OA before the Tribunal, which held\nthat in view of its earlier decision and consequent dismissal of SLP by this\nCourt, the issue could not be reopened. Appellant filed Writ Petition before\nHigh Court, which was dismissed. Hence the present appeal.\nF\nDismissing the appeal, the Court\nHELD: 1.1. The State of Orissa and other applicants did not file any\nspecial leave petition before this Court except appellant. The order of the\nG Tribunal dated 9.3.1992 thus attained finality. The principle of res judicata\nwould, therefore, apply. This Court while passing its order dated\n05.01.1993 did not and could not have dispensed with the applicability of\nthe principle of res judicata, as the right of the respondents derived from\nthe order of the Tribunal dated 9.3.1992 could not have been taken away.\n[121-D-E, FI\nH\n116\n.\u003e\nSARAT CHANDRA MISHRA v. STATE OF ORISSA\n117\n?\n1.2. The judgment and order dated 9.3.1992 would indisputably be A\nbinding on the State and the appellants and, thus, it is not open to them\nto raise the said question once again. [121-H]\n2.1. The judgment of a court, cannot be read as a statute. While\nconstruing a judgment, it may be presumed that the same has been\nrendered in accordance with law. [122-B]\nRamesh Chand Daga v. Rameshwari Bai, [2005] 4 SCC 772 and Gajraj\nSingh and Ors. v. State of UP \u0026 Ors., [2001] 5 SCC 762, referred to.\n[122-C]\n2.2. The order of this Court dated 5.1.1993 must be construed having\nregard to the entire factual and legal backdrop. It is no doubt true that\nthis Court refused to determine the matter on merit and came to the\nopinion that the special leave petition had become infructuous in view of\nthe order of the State Government dated 12.8.1992, but the fact remains\nthat even before this Court the said order of the State Government was\nnot questioned. [122-G, H]\nB\nC\nD\n3. This Court moreover, granted liberty to approach the appropriate\nforum only in the event any distinct cause of action arises therefor,\npresumably meaning thereby, when an error had been committed by the\nState in implementing the said order in individual cases. This Court by E\nits order, had no intention to give liberty to the appellants to reopen the\nquestion as regard the validity or otherwise of the Gradation List of 1984\nwhich became final and binding. Once the said order attained finality, this\nCourt could not have allowed the parties to approach the Tribunal once\nagain indirectly. As the principle of res judicata was applicable, the\nTribunal had no jurisdiction to reopen the issue. This Court could not and\ndid not confer a jurisdiction upon the Tribunal which it did not have.\n[123-A-C]\n4. It is furthermore well-settled that this Court cannot exercise its\njurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution of India in violation of\nthe statutory provisions and that too at this distant time so as to unsettle\na settled thing. [123-B-D]\nCIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal Nos. 5087 of 2002.\nFrom the Judgment and Order dated 20.9.2001 of the Orissa High\nCourt in O.J.C. No. 14151/99.\nF\nG\nH\n118\nA\nB\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2006] 1 S.C.R.\nRaju Ramachandran and Jana Kalyan Das for the Appellants.\nJanaranjan Das, Swetaketu Mishra, S.B. Upadhyay, Sanjay K. Das and\nAjay Choudhary for the Respondents.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nS.B. SINHA, J. The appellants and the private respondents herein were\nappointed as Lower Division Assistants/Junior Assistants between the period\n28.09.1966 and 05.09.1973. Recruitment process was undertaken by the Orissa\nPublic Service Commission in terms of the Orissa Ministerial Service (Method\nof Recruitment \u0026 Conditions of Service of Lower Division Assistant in the\nC Office of the Department of Secretariat) Rules, 1951 (for short, the OMS\nRules, 1951'). After their appointments, the appointees were recruited in\nvarious departments. With a view to avail promotional opportunities, the\nappointees were required to pass an examination known as 'STC Examination'.\nAll the employees admitted were promoted after they had passed the said\nD examination. The private respondents passed the examination before the\nappellants herein and as such they were promoted earlier. On or about\n01.01.1984, a Gradation List was published wherein the respondents were\nshown senior to the appellants herein. The appellants contended that having\nregard to the fact that seniority of the ministerial officers was to be reckoned\non the basis of ranks obtained by them in PSC examination; only because\nsome employees working in some departments were sent for training earlier\nthan the others which enabled them to pass the STC examination before\nthem, the respondents could not have been treated to be senior by reason of\nsuch fortuitous circumstances.\nE\nF\nG\nRepresentations were made by the appellants before the State of Orissa.\nThe State issued a circular dated 21.02. 1989 purporting to set up new\nprinciples for fixing seniority in the cadre of Lower Grade Assistants in the\nhigher grade and consequently a corrected Gradation List was published on\n22.08.1990.\nThe legality and validity of the said circular dated 21.02.1989 and the\nGradation List dated 22.08.1990 came to be questioned by the respondents\nherein before the Orissa Administrative Tribunal (for short, ‘the Tribunal')\nwhich was marked as O.A. No. 1200 of 1990. Some of the appellants herein\nalso filed an original application, which was marked as O.A. No.90 of 1990,\npraying for a direction that the common 1984 Gradation List be revised and\nH consequently the 1990 Gradation List which was published pursuant to the\n7\nSARAT CHANDRA MISHRA v. STATE OF ORISSA [SINHA. J.] 119\ncircular letter dated 21.02.1989 be upheld. Both the aforementioned original A\napplications were disposed of by a judgment and order dated 09.03.1992,\nholding:\n\"... We, therefore, have no hesitation in holding that the gradation list\ndrawn up as per Home Department letter No. 10535/F dated 21.2.1989\nand consequently refixation of seniority in the Home Department's B\nletter in Memo No.24961/CC dated 22.5.1990 and by Home\nDepartment's Memo No.56814 dated 22.8.1990 are illegal and hereby\nquashed. All the future promotions above the rank of Senior Assistants\nand Section Officer, Level-II shall be governed by the gradation list\nmade in the year, 1984 and the promotions given effect to accordingly.\nThe principle decided shall govern all the cases i.e. O.A. 1200/90,\nC.A. 1037/90, OA 817/90, OA 783/90, OA 516/90 and OA 90/90.\nThe prayer in O.A. 90/90 is dismissed relating to quashing of the\nGradation list of 1984. The other five petitions are allowed and our\norder will govern the seniority of all Senior Assistants and Section\nOfficer Level II...\"\nC\nD\nThe State of Orissa and the appellants herein did not question the\ncorrectness of the said order. Only one Suresh Kumar Chhotray filed an\napplication for grant of special leave to appeal in this Court questioning the\ncorrectness of the said judgment and order dated 09.03.1992 passed by the E\nTribunal. During the pendency of the special leave petition, the State of\nOrissa issued a circular letter purported to be in terms of the said judgment\nand order dated 09.03.1992, stating:\n\"In pursuant of the decisions of the Orissa Administrative Tribunal\non 9.3.1992 in O.A. No. 1200/90 the Gradation List of Senior Assistants F\nissued in Home Department Memo No.24961 dated 22.5.1990 and\nNo.56814 dated 22.8.1990 is hereby superseded and the Gradation\nList of Senior Assistants circulated in Home Department Memo No.\n3 dated 1.1.1984 and Memo No.53218 (40)/CC dated 27.9.1984 is\nhereby restored. Home Department letter No.10535/CC dated 21.2.89\nstands withdrawn.\"\nThe application for grant of special leave filed by the aforementioned\nSuresh Kumar Chhotray came up for hearing before this Court on 05.01.1993.\nIn view of the aforementioned Government Order dated 12.08.1992, this\nCourt opined that the said special leave petition had become infructuous on\nG\nH\n120\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2006] 1 S.C.R.\nA the premise that the State intended to issue the said circular letter dated\n12.08.1992 as a matter of policy independent of the order of the Tribunal. It\nwas, however, observed:\nB\nC\n\"We may, therefore, observe that the right, if any, of the petitioner\nand other similarly situate to assail any action of the Government\nbased on any distinct cause of action shall not be treated as conclusive\nby the dismissal of this Special Leave Petition as infructuous. The\npetitioner would be free to pursue such remedy as may be available\nto him in that behalf. The Special Leave Petition is dismissed as\ninfurctuous.\"\nRelying on or on the basis of the said purported observations made by\nthis Court in the aforementioned Special Leave Petition (Civil) No. 10513 of\n1992, original applications were filed by the appellants before the Tribunal.\nBy its judgment and order, the Tribunal held that having regard to its earlier\ndecision and consequent dismissal of the special leave petition by this Court,\nD the issue could not be reopened, particularly, when the applicants therein had\nnot been able to show any distinct cause of action to agitate their case afresh\nother than stressing hard for maintaining their seniority as per the guidelines\ndated 21.02.1989 on the basis of which gradation list of the year 1990 was\nprepared.\nE\nF\nG\nAggrieved by and dissatisfied therewith the Appellants filed a writ\npetition before the Orissa High Court which was marked as O.J.C. No.14151\nof 1999 and by an order dated 20.09.2001, the said writ petition was dismissed.\nIn its judgment the High Court opined :\n\"It is submitted by Dr. Misra appearing for the petitioners that\nthey are entitled to raise the questions in view of the liberty given by\nthe Supreme Court. We are unable to accept the said submission in\nas much as the reliefs prayed for by the petitioners, if granted, would\namount to reversing the earlier judgment and order of the Tribunal\neven though special leave petition against the same had been dismissed\nby the Supreme Court. We do not find any illegality or infirmity in\nthe impugned order passed by the Full Bench of the Tribunal and as\nsuch there is no question of interference with the same.\"\nMr. Raju Ramachandran, the learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf\nof the appellants, submitted that in view of the fact that the special leave\nH petition filed against the judgment and order dated 09.03.1992 passed by the\nSARAT CHANDRA MISHRA v. STATE OF ORISSA [SINHA. J.] 121\nTribunal had not been disposed of on merit and as thereby liberty had been A\ngranted to the petitioner therein to question the said order dated 12.08.1992\nafresh, the Tribunal and consequently the High Court committed a manifest\nerror in not entertaining the original application and the writ petition,\nrespectively.\nThe learned counsel would submit that it is a fit case where this Court B\nshould exercise its discretionary jurisdiction under Article 142 of the\nConstitution of India so as to enable the appellants to obtain at least the\nmonetary benefits as most of them have since retired.\nWe are not persuaded to accept the said submission of the learned\nC\ncounsel. Two sets of applications were filed before the Tribunal at the first\ninstance; one questioning the legality of the Common Gradation List of the\nyear 01.01.1984; and another questioning the legality of the circular letter\ndated 21.02.1989 and consequent publication of the Gradation List dated\n22.08.1990. Both the sets of applications were heard together. Whereas the\noriginal applications filed by the respondents were allowed, those filed by D\nsome of the Appellants were dismissed. One special leave petition was filed\nagainst that part of the judgment and order of the Tribunal, whereby only\nO.A. No.90 of 1990 was dismissed. The State of Orissa or for that matter, the\nappellants herein did not file any special leave petition before this Court\nquestioning the said order except one Suresh Kumar Chhotray. The judgment\nand order of the Tribunal dated 09.03.1992 passed in O.A. No. 1200 of 1990,\nthus, attained finality. The principle of res judicata would, therefore, apply\nin the instant case. The applicability of the principle of res judicata in a\nproceeding before the Tribunal is not disputed. It is also not a case where the\njurisdiction of the Tribunal is in question.\nE\nF\nThis Court while passing its order dated 05.01.1993 did not and could\nnot have dispensed with the applicability of the principle of res judicata, as\nthe right of the respondents derived from the judgment and order of the\nTribunal dated 09.03.1992 could not have been taken away. In any event, the\ndecision of the Tribunal in O.A. No.90 of 1990 wherein, as noticed supra,\nsome of the appellants had questioned the validity or otherwise of the Gradation G\nList as contained in Home Department's letter dated 27.09.1984 attained\nfinality.\nThe judgment and order passed in the said O.A. No. 90 of 1990 would\nindisputably be binding on the State and the appellants herein and, thus, it is\nnot open to them to raise the said question once again. Furthermore the\nH\n122\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2006] 1 S.C.R.\nA seniority list which was revised following the Home Department's letter dated\n21.02.1989 and consequent fixation of seniority in terms of Home\nDepartment's letters dated 22.05.1990 and 22.08.1990 were declared to be\nillegal.\nIt is in the aforementioned backdrop, the order of this Court dated\nB 05.01.1993 is required to be construed. The judgment of a court, it is well\nsettled, cannot be read as a statute. While construing a judgment, it may be\npresumed that the same has been rendered in accordance with law.\nC\nD\nE\nF\nIn Ramesh Chand Daga v. Rameshwari Bai, [2005] 4 SCC 772, this\nCourt held :\n“A judgment, as is well known, is not to be read as a statute. A\njudgment, it is trite, must be construed upon reading the same as a\nwhole. For the said purpose the attendant circumstances may also be\ntaken into consideration. (Islamic Academy of Education v. State of\nKarnataka, Zee Telefilms Ltd. v. Union of India and P.S. Sathappan\nv. Andhra Bank Ltd)”\nIn Gajraj Singh and Ors v. State of UP and Ors., [2001] 5 SCC 762,\nthis Court held :\n“...A doubt arising from reading a judgment of the Court can be\nresolved by assuming that the judgment was delivered consistently\nwith the provisions of law and therefore a course or procedure in\ndeparture from or not in conformity with statutory provisions cannot\nbe said to have been intended or laid down by the Court unless it has\nbeen so stated specifically.\"\nThe jurisdiction of this Court under Article 142 of the Constitution of\nIndia is not meant to be exercised in a situation of this nature. Mr.\nRamachandran is not correct in contending that the appellants did not get any\nopportunity to canvass their case at all. They had such an opportunity before\nthe Tribunal. They, it will bear repetition to state, except one did not assail\nG the findings of the Tribunal. The order of this Court dated 05.01.1993 must\nbe construed having regard to the entire factual and legal backdrop. It is no\ndoubt true that this Court refused to determine the matter on merit and came\nto the opinion that the special leave petition had become infructuous in view\nof the order of the State Government dated 12.08.1992, but the fact remains\nthat even before this Court the said order of the Sate Government was not\nH\nSARAT CHANDRA MISHRA v. STATE OF ORISSA [SINHA. J.] 123\nquestioned.\nA\nThis Court moreover, as noticed hereinbefore, granted liberty to approach\nthe appropriate forum only in the event any distinct cause of action arises\ntherefor, presumably meaning thereby, when an error had been committed by\nthe State in implementing the said order in individual cases. This Court by\nits order, in our considered opinion, had no intention to give liberty to the\nB\nappellants herein to reopen the question as regard the validity or otherwise\nof the Gradation List of 1984 which, as noticed hereinbefore, became final\nand binding. Once the said order attained finality, this Court could not have\nallowed the parties to approach the Tribunal once again indirectly it could\nnot have done so directly. As the principle of res judicata was applicable, the\nTribunal had no jurisdiction to reopen the issue. This Court could not and did\nnot confer a jurisdiction upon the Tribunal which it did not have.\nC\nIt is furthermore well-settled, this Court cannot exercise its jurisdiction\nunder Article 142 of the Constitution of India in violation of the statutory\nprovisions and that too at this distant time so as to unsettle a settled thing. D\nFor the reasons aforementioned, there is no merit in this appeal which\nis accordingly dismissed. However, in the facts and circumstances of the\ncase, there shall be no order as to costs.\nD.G.\nAppeal dismissed. E\n"}
