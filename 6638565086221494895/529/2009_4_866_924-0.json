The hope and expectation of the framers of the\nConstitution that after independence every citizen will get\nequal opportunity in the matter of employment or\nappointment to any office under the State and members\nof civil services would remain committed to the\nConstitution and honestly serve the people of this country\nhave been belied by what has actually happened in last\nfour decades. The Public Service Commissions which\nC have been given the status of Constitutional Authorities\nand which are supposed to be totally independent and\nimpartial while discharging their function in terms of\nArticle 320 have become victims of spoil system. In the\nbeginning, people with the distinction in different fields\nof administration and social life were appointed as\nChairman and members of the Public Service\nCommissions but with the passage of time appointment\nto these high offices became personal prerogatives of the\npolitical head of the Government and men with\nE questionable background have been appointed to these\ncoveted positions. Such appointees have, instead of\nmaking selections for appointment to higher echelons of\nservices on merit, indulged in exhibition of faithfulness\nto their mentors totally unmindful of their Constitutional\nF responsibility. This is one of several reasons why most\nmeritorious in the academics opt for private employment\nand ventures. The scenario is worst when it comes to\nappointment to lower strata of the civil services. Those\nwho have been bestowed with the power to make\nappointment on Class III and Class IV posts have by and\nlarge misused and abused the same by violating relevant\nrules and instructions and have indulged in favouritism\nand nepotism with impunity resulting in total negation of\nthe equality clause enshrined in Article 16 of the\nConstitution. Thousands of cases have been filed in the\nG\nH\nSTATE OF BIHAR V.\nUPENDRA NARAYAN SINGH \u0026 OTHERS\n869\nCourts by aggrieved persons with the complaints that A\nappointment to Class III and Class IV posts have been\nmade without issuing any advertisement or sending\nrequisition to the employment exchange as per the\nrequirement of the 1959 Act and those who have links with\nthe party in power or political leaders or who could pull B\nstrings in the power corridors get the cake of employment.\nCases have also been filed with the complaints that\nrecruitment to the higher strata of civil services made by\nthe Public Service Commissions have been affected by\nthe virus of spoil system in different dimensions and\nselections have been made for considerations other than\nmerit.

The so-called regularization of the services of the\nrespondents on which heavy reliance was placed in the\ncontext of averments contained in paragraph 4 of the\ncounter affidavit filed before this Court by respondent no.3\nis a proof of nepotism practiced by the officer and\ndeserves to be ignored. For the reasons best known to\nthem, the respondents have not produced copy of the\norder by which their services were regularised. Perhaps\nnone exists. The statement furnished by counsel for the\nappellant, which is accompanied by documents marked\n'A' and 'B', shows that in less than 7 months of the\nrespondents appointment (except respondent no.1 who\nis said to have been appointed with effect from 9.10.1991),\nDr. Darogi Razak is said to have written confidential\nmemorandum bearing no.20 dated 11.5.1992 (Annexure'A')\nto District Animal Husbandry Officer, Aurongabad, Gaya\nthat ad hoc appointments made vide Memorandum\nNo.1467 dated 9.10.1991 are being regularized temporarily\nby the local appointments committee constituted on\n11.5.1992. What is most amazing to notice is that the local\nappointments committee was constituted on 11.5.1992,\nthe committee met on the same day and regularised the\nad hoc appointments and on that very day the Regional\nDirector sent confidential letter to his subordinate, i.e., the\nDistrict Animal Husbandry Officer informing him about the\nregularization of ad hoc appointments. No rule or policy\nhas been brought to the notice of the Court which\nempowers the appointing authority to regularize ad hoc\nappointments within a period of less than 7 months.\nSTATE OF BIHAR V.\nUPENDRA NARAYAN SINGH \u0026 OTHERS\n871\nTherefore, this Court has no hesitation to hold that the A\nexercise undertaken by Dr. Darogi Razak for showing that\nappointments of the respondents were regularized by the\nlocal appointments committee on 11.5.1992 was a farce.\n[Para 32] [916-C-H; 917-A]\nSecretary, State of Karnataka vs. Uma Devi 2006 (4) SCC\n1 - relied on.\nB\n5. The initial appointments of the respondents were\nmade in gross violation of the doctrine of equality\nenshrined in Articles 14 and 16 and the provisions of the C\n- 1959 Act and the Single Judge of the High Court gravely\nerred by directing their reinstatement with consequential\nbenefits. [Para 33] [917-B]\n6. By now it is settled that the guarantee of equality\nbefore law enshrined in Article 14 is a positive concept D\nand it cannot be enforced by a citizen or court in a negative\nmanner. If an illegality or irregularity has been committed\nin favour of any individual or a group of individuals or a\nwrong order has been passed by a judicial forum, others\ncannot invoke the jurisdiction of the higher or superior\nCourt for repeating or multiplying the same irregularity or\nillegality or for passing wrong order.[Para 34] [917-D-E]\nE\nLL\nF\nChandigarh Administration and another v.

Notwithstanding\nthis, ad hoc appointments continued to be made in violation of\nthe rules and relevant instructions. This compelled the State\nGovernment to pass order dated 10.3.1985 for cancellation of\nad hoc appointments and for filling the vacancies in accordance\nwith the rules. After one year, the issue relating to large scale\nillegalities committed in the making of ad hoc appointments was\nraised in the Bihar Legislative Assembly and members\nexpressed concern over such appointments.
