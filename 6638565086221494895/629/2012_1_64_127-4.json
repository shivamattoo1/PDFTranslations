Even in the Nuremberg trials\nthe Nazi war criminals, responsible for killing millions of\npersons, were yet provided counsel. Therefore when we\nsay that the accused should be provided counsel we are\nnot bringing into existence a new principle but simply\nrecognising what already existed and which civilised\npeople have long enjoyed.\n14. In the case of Hussainara Khatoon and Others v.\nHome Secy., State of Bihar (1980) 1 SCC 98, it is held:\n\"6. Then there are several undertrial prisoners who are\ncharged with offences which are bailable but who are still\nin jail presumably because no application for bail has been\nmade on their behalf or being too poor they are unable to\nfurnish bail. It is not uncommon to find that undertrial\nprisoners who are produced before the Magistrates are\nunaware of their right to obtain release on bail and on\naccount of their poverty, they are unable to engage a\nlawyer who would apprise them of their right to apply for\nbail and help them to secure release on bail by making a\nproper application to the Magistrate in that behalf.\nSometimes the Magistrates also refuse to release the\nundertrial prisoners produced before them on their\npersonal bond but insist on monetary bail with sureties,\nwhich by reason of their poverty the undertrial prisoners are\nunable to furnish and which, therefore, effectively shuts out\nfor them any possibility of release from pre-trial detention.\nThis unfortunate situation cries aloud for introduction of an\nadequate and comprehensive legal service programme,\nbut so far, these cries do not seem to have evoked any\nresponse. We do not think it is possible to reach the\nbenefits of the legal process to the poor, to protect them\nagainst injustice and to secure to them their constitutional\nand statutory rights unless there is a nation-wide legal\nservice programme to provide free legal services to them.\nIt is now well settled, as a result of the decision of this Court\nMOHD. HUSSAIN @ JULFIKAR ALI v. STATE (GOVT. 105\nOF NCT) DELHI [H.L. DATTU, J.]\nB\nC\nin Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India that when Article 21 A\nprovides that no person shall be deprived of his life or\nliberty except in accordance with the procedure\nestablished by law, it is not enough that there should be\nsome semblance of procedure provided by law, but the\nprocedure under which a person may be deprived of his\nlife or liberty should be “reasonable, fair and just”. Now, a\nprocedure which does not make available legal services\nto an accused person who is too poor to afford a lawyer\nand who would, therefore, have to go through the trial\nwithout legal assistance, cannot possibly be regarded as\n\"reasonable, fair and just”. It is an essential ingredient of\nreasonable, fair and just procedure to a prisoner who is\nto seek his liberation through the court's process that he\nshould have legal services available to him. This Court\npointed out in M.H. Hoskot v. State of Maharashtra :\n\"Judicial justice, with procedural intricacies, legal\nsubmissions and critical examination of evidence, leans\nupon professional expertise; and a failure of equal justice\nunder the law is on the cards where such supportive skill\nis absent for one side. Our judicature, moulded by Anglo-\nAmerican models and our judicial process, engineered by\nkindred legal technology, compel the collaboration of\nlawyer-power for steering the wheels of equal justice under\nthe law\". Free legal services to the poor and the needy is\nan essential element of any \"reasonable, fair and just\"\nprocedure. It is not necessary to quote authoritative\npronouncements by Judges and Jurists in support of the\nview that without the service of a lawyer an accused\nperson would be denied “reasonable, fair and just”\nprocedure. Black, J., observed in Gideon v. Wainwright:\n\"Not only those precedents but also reason and\nreflection require us to recognise that in our adversary\nsystem of criminal justice, any person haled into court, who\nis too poor to hire a lawyer cannot be assured a fair trial\nD\nE\nF\nG\nI\nA\nB\nс\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n106 SUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2012] 1 S.C.R.\nunless counsel is provided for him. This seems to us to\nbe an obvious truth. Governments, both State and Federal\nquite properly spend vast sums of money to establish\nmachinery to try defendants accused of crime. Lawyers to\nprosecute are everywhere deemed essential to protect the\npublic's interest in an orderly society. Similarly, there are\nfew defendants charged with crime who fail to hire the best\nlawyers they can get to prepare and present their\ndefences. That Government hires lawyers to prosecute\nand defendants who have the money hire lawyers to defend\nare the strongest indications of the widespread belief that\nlawyers in criminal courts are necessities, not luxuries. The\nright of one charged with crime to counsel may not be\ndeemed fundamental and essential to fair trials in some\ncountries, but is in ours. From the very beginning, our State\nand national constitutions and laws have laid great\nemphasis on procedural and substantive safeguards\ndesigned to assure fair trials before impartial tribunals in\nwhich every defendant stands equal before the law. This\nnoble ideal cannot be realised if the poor man charged\nwith crime has to face his accusers without a lawyer to\nassist him.\"\nThe philosophy of free legal service as an essential\nelement of fair procedure is also to be found in the\npassage from the judgment of Douglas, J. in Jon Richard\nArgersinger v. Raymond Hamlin :\n\"The right to be heard would be, in many cases, of little\navail if it did not comprehend the right to be heard by\ncounsel. Even the intelligent and educated layman has\nsmall and sometimes no skill in the science of law. If\ncharged with crime, he is incapable, generally, of\ndetermining for himself whether the indictment is good or\nbad. He is unfamiliar with the rules of evidence. Left without\nthe aid of counsel he may be put on trial without a proper\ncharge, and convicted upon incompetent evidence, or\nMOHD. HUSSAIN @ JULFIKAR ALI v. STATE (GOVT. 107\nOF NCT) DELHI [H.L. DATTU, J.]\nevidence irrelevant to the issue or otherwise inadmissible. A\nHe lacks both the skill and knowledge adequately to\nprepare his defence, even though he has a perfect one.\nHe requires the guiding hand of counsel at every step in\nthe proceedings against him. Without it, though he be not\nguilty, he faces the danger of conviction because he does\nnot know how to establish his innocence. If that be true of\nmen of intelligence, how much more true is it of the ignorant\nand illiterate or those of feeble intellect.\nBoth Powell and Gideon involved felonies. But their\nrationale has relevance to any criminal trial, where an\naccused is deprived of his liberty.\nB\nC\nThe court should consider the probable sentence that\nwill follow if a conviction is obtained. The more serious the\nlikely consequences, the greater is the probability that a D\nlawyer should be appointed .... The court should consider\nthe individual factors peculiar to each case. These, of\ncourse would be the most difficult to anticipate. One\nrelevant factor would be the competency of the individual\ndefendant to present his own case.\" (emphasis added)\"\n15. In the case of Khatri Vs. State of Bihar (1981) 1 SCC\n627, this Court has held :\nE\n\"5. That takes us to one other important issue which arises\nin this case. It is clear from the particulars supplied by the F\nState from the records of the various judicial Magistrates\ndealing with the blinded prisoners from time to time that,\nneither at the time when the blinded prisoners were\nproduced for the first time before the Judicial Magistrate\nnor at the time when the remand orders were passed, was\nany legal representation available to most of the blinded\nprisoners. The records of the Judicial Magistrates show\nthat no legal representation was provided to the blinded.\nprisoners, because none of them asked for it nor did the\nG\nH\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\n0\nH\n108\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2012] 1 S.C.R.\nJudicial Magistrates enquire from the blinded prisoners\nproduced before them either initially or at the time of\nremand whether they wanted any legal representation at\nState cost. The only excuse for not providing legal\nrepresentation to the blinded prisoners at the cost of the\nState was that none of the blinded prisoners asked for it.\nThe result was that barring two or three blinded prisoners\nwho managed to get a lawyer to represent them at the later\nstages of remand, most of the blinded prisoners were not\nrepresented by any lawyers and save a few who were\nreleased on bail, and that too after being in jail for quite\nsome time, the rest of them continued to languish in jail. It\nis difficult to understand how this state of affairs could be\npermitted to continue despite the decision of this Court in\nHussainara Khatoon (IV) case. This Court has pointed out\nin Hussainara Khatoon (IV) case which was decided as\nfar back as March 9, 1979 that the right to free legal\nservices is clearly an essential ingredient of reasonable,\nfair and just procedure for a person accused of an offence\nand it must be held implicit in the guarantee of Article 21\nand the State is under a constitutional mandate to provide\na lawyer to an accused person if the circumstances of the\ncase and the needs of justice so require, provided of\ncourse the accused person does not object to the provision\nof such lawyer. It is unfortunate that though this Court\ndeclared the right to legal aid as a fundamental right of an\naccused person by a process of judicial construction of\nArticle 21, most of the States in the country have not taken\nnote of this decision and provided free legal services to a\nperson accused of an offence. We regret this disregard\nof the decision of the highest court in the land by many of\nthe States despite the constitutional declaration in Article\n141 that the law declared by this Court shall be binding\nthroughout the territory of India. Mr K.G. Bhagat on behalf\nof the State agreed that in view of the decision of this\nCourt the State was bound to provide free legal services\nto an indigent accused but he suggested that the State\nMOHD. HUSSAIN @ JULFIKAR ALI v. STATE (GOVT. 109\nOF NCT) DELHI [H.L. DATTU, J.]\nA\nD\nmight find it difficult to do so owing to financial constraints.\nWe may point out to the State of Bihar that it cannot avoid\nits constitutional obligation to provide free legal services\nto a poor accused by pleading financial or administrative\ninability. The State is under a constitutional mandate to\nprovide free legal aid to an accused person who is unable B\nto secure legal services on account of indigence and\nwhatever is necessary for this purpose has to be done by\nthe State. The State may have its financial constraints and\nits priorities in expenditure but, as pointed out by the court\nin Rhem v. Malcolm \"the law does not permit any C\nGovernment to deprive its citizens of constitutional rights\non a plea of poverty\" and to quote the words of Justice\nBlackmum in Jackson v. Bishop “humane considerations\nand constitutional requirements are not in this day to be\nmeasured by dollar considerations\". Moreover, this\nconstitutional obligation to provide free legal services to\nan indigent accused does not arise only when the trial\ncommences but also attaches when the accused is for the\nfirst time produced before the Magistrate. It is elementary\nthat the jeopardy to his personal liberty arises as soon as\na person is arrested and produced before a Magistrate,\nfor it is at that stage that he gets the first opportunity to\napply for bail and obtain his release as also to resist\nremand to police or jail custody. That is the stage at which\nan accused person needs competent legal advice and\nrepresentation and no procedure can be said to be\nreasonable, fair and just which denies legal advice and\nrepresentation to him at this stage. We must, therefore,\nhold that the State is under a constitutional obligation to\nprovide free legal services to an indigent accused not only\nat the stage of trial but also at the stage when he is first G\nproduced before the Magistrate as also when he is\nremanded from time to time..\n6. But even this right to free legal services would be\nillusory for an indigent accused unless the Magistrate or\nE\nF\nH\nA\nB\n0\nC\nD\nE\nய\nF\nG\nH\n110 SUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2012] 1 S.C.R.\nthe Sessions Judge before whom he is produced informs\nhim of such right. It is common knowledge that about 70\nper cent of the people in the rural areas are illiterate and\neven more than that percentage of people are not aware\nof the rights conferred upon them by law. There is so much\nlack of legal awareness that it has always been recognised\nas one of the principal items of the programme of the legal\naid movement in this country to promote legal literacy. It\nwould make a mockery of legal aid if it were to be left to a\npoor ignorant and illiterate accused to ask for free legal\nservices. Legal aid would become merely a paper\npromise and it would fail of its purpose. The Magistrate\nor the Sessions Judge before whom the accused appears\nmust be held to be under an obligation to inform the\naccused that if he is unable to engage the services of a\nlawyer on account of poverty or indigence, he is entitled\nto obtain free legal services at the cost of the State.\nUnfortunately, the Judicial Magistrates failed to discharge\nthis obligation in the case of the blinded prisoners and they\nmerely stated that no legal representation was asked for\nby the blinded prisoners and hence none was provided.\nWe would, therefore, direct the Magistrates and Sessions\nJudges in the country to inform every accused who\nappears before them and who is not represented by a\nlawyer on account of his poverty or indigence that he is\nentitled to free legal services at the cost of the State.\nUnless he is not willing to take advantage of the free legal\nservices provided by the State, he must be provided legal\nrepresentation at the cost of the State. We would also\ndirect the State of Bihar and require every other State in\nthe country to make provision for grant of free legal\nservices to an accused who is unable to engage a lawyer\non account of reasons such as poverty, indigence or\nincommunicable situation. The only qualification would be\nthat the offence charged against the accused is such that,\non conviction, it would result in a sentence of imprisonment\nMOHD. HUSSAIN @ JULFIKAR ALI v. STATE (GOVT. 111\nOF NCT) DELHI [H.L. DATTU, J.]\nand is of such a nature that the circumstances of the case A\nand the needs of social justice require that he should be\ngiven free legal representation. There may be cases\ninvolving offences such as economic offences or offences\nagainst law prohibiting prostitution or child abuse and the\nlike, where social justice may require that free legal B\nservices need not be provided by the State.\"\n16. In Ram Awadh v. State of U.P. 1999 Cr.L.J. 4083, the\nAllahabad High Court held:\nE\n\"14. The requirement of providing counsel to an accused C\nat the State expense is not an empty formality which may\nbe not by merely appointing a counsel whatever his\ncalibre may be. When the law énjoins appointing a\ncounsel to defend an accused, it means an effective\ncounsel, a counsel in real sense who can safeguard the D\ninterest of the accused in best possible manner which is\npermissible under law. An accused facing charge of\nmurder may be sentenced to death or imprisonment for\nlife and consequently his case should be handled by a\ncompetent person and not by a novice or one who has\nno professional expertise. A duty is cast upon the Judges\nbefore whom such indigent accused are facing trial for\nserious offence and who are not able to engage a counsel,\nto appoint competent persons for their defence. It is\nneedless to emphasis that a Judge is not a prosecutor\nand his duty is to discern the truth so that he is able to\narrive at a correct conclusion. A defence lawyer plays an\nimportant role in bringing out the truth before the Court by\ncross-examining the witnesses and placing relevant\nmaterials or evidence. The absence of proper cross-\nexamination may at times result in miscarriage of justice\nand the Court has to guard against such an eventuality.\"\nF\nG\n17. The prompt disposition of criminal cases is to be\ncommended and encouraged. But in reaching that result, the\naccused charged with a serious offence must not be stripped H\nA\n112 SUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2012] 1 S.C.R.\nof his valuable right of a fair and impartial trial. To do that, would\nbe negation of concept of due process of law, regardless of\nthe merits of the appeal. The Cr.P.C. provides that in all criminal\nprosecutions, the accused has a right to have the assistance\nof a counsel and the Cr.P.C. also requires the court in all\nB criminal cases, where the accused is unable to engage counsel,\nto appoint a counsel for him at the expenses of the State.\nHowsoever guilty the appellant upon the inquiry might have\nbeen, he is until convicted, presumed to be innocent. It was the\nduty of the Court, having these cases in charge, to see that he\nC is denied no necessary incident of a fair trial. In the present\ncase, not only the accused was denied the assistance of a\ncounsel during the trial and such designation of counsel, as was\nattempted at a late stage, was either so indefinite or so close\nupon the trial as to amount to a denial of effective and\nD substantial aid in that regard. The Court ought to have seen to\nit that in the proceedings before the court, the accused was\ndealt with justly and fairly by keeping in view the cardinal\nprinciples that the accused of a crime is entitled to a counsel\nwhich may be necessary for his defence, as well as to facts as\nto law. The same yardstick may not be applicable in respect\nof economic offences or where offences are not punishable with\nsubstantive sentence of imprisonment but punishable with fine\nonly. The fact that the right involved is of such a character that\nit cannot be denied without violating those fundamental\nprinciples of liberty and justice which lie at the base of all our\njudicial proceedings. The necessity of counsel was so vital and\nimperative that the failure of the trial court to make an effective\nappointment of a counsel was a denial of due process of law.\nIt is equally true that the absence of fair and proper trial would\nbe violation of fundamental principles of judicial procedure on\naccount of breach of mandatory provisions of Section 304 of\nCr.P.C.\nE\nF\nG\nH\n18. After carefully going through the entire records of the\ntrial court, I am convinced that the appellant/accused was not\nMOHD. HUSSAIN @ JU'_FIKAR ALI v. STATE (GOVT. 113\nOF NCT) DELHI [H.L. DATTU, J.]\nprovided the assistance of a counsel in a substantial and A\nmeaningful sense. To hold and decide otherwise, would simply\nto ignore actualities and also would be to ignore the\nfundamental postulates, already adverted to.\n19. The learned counsel for the respondent-State, Sri Atri\ncontends that since no prejudice is caused to accused in not\nproviding a defence counsel, this Court need not take exception\nto the trial concluded by the learned Sessions Judge and the\nconviction and sentence passed against the accused. I find it\ndifficult to accept the argument of the learned senior counsel.\nThe Cr. P.C. ensures that an accused gets a fair trial. It is\nessential that the accused is given a reasonable opportunity\nto defend himself in the trial. He is also permitted to confront\nthe witnesses and other evidence that the prosecution is relying\nupon. He is also allowed the assistance of a lawyer of his\nchoice, and if he is unable to afford one, he is given a lawyer\nfor his defence. The right to be defended by a learned counsel\nis a principal part of the right to fair trial. If these minimum\nsafeguards are not provided to an accused; that itself is\n\"prejudice\" to an accused. It is worth to notice the observations\nmade by this Court in the case of Rafiq Ahmad alias Rafi vs.\nState of U.P. (2011) 8 SCC 300, wherein it is observed:\nB\nC\nD\nE\n\"35. When we speak of prejudice to an accused, it has to\nbe shown that the accused has suffered some disability\nor detriment in the protections available to him under the F\nIndian criminal jurisprudence. It is also a settled canon of\ncriminal law that this has occasioned the accused with\nfailure of justice. One of the other cardinal principles of\ncriminal justice administration is that the courts should\nmake a close examination to ascertain whether there was\nreally a failure of justice or whether it is only a camouflage,\nas this expression is perhaps too pliable. With the\ndevelopment of law, Indian courts have accepted the\nfollowing protections to and rights of the accused during\ninvestigation and trial:\nG\nH\n"}
