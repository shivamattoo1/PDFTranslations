In addition, documentation,\nregistration and other expenses were to be borne by the vendee. A sum of Rs.\n5,00,000/- was paid by the Vendee and the balance due, was Rs. 3,41,190/-.\nSince, the vendee did not pay the sum due, the sale transaction was not\ncomplete, and therefore the room was not put in the possession of the vendee.\nH\n924\nA\nT\nBHANDARI CONSTRUCTION COMPANY NARAYAN GOPAL UPADHYE\n925\nB\nAggrieved, vendee approached the District Consumer Redressal Forum with A\na complaint. However, his case as per amended complaint was that the vendor\nagreed to sell a room for a price of Rs.9,00,110/-. The amount was paid by\nhim in a lump and receipt was issued. Though, the vendor issued an allotment\nletter, but in spite of repeated demands after completion of the construction,\nthe vendor did not put him in possession and an extra amount was demanded\nfrom him. It issued a notice intending to terminate the agreement. Since\npossession was not given and the company attempted to sell the premises to\nsomeone else, he suffered losses. The payment by the purchaser was to be\nthe essence of the contract. The total purchase price shown in the agreement\nwas Rs.7,75,000/-. In his evidence before the District Forum, the respondent-\npurchaser made a departure from the complaint regarding consideration, C\nadmitting that a sum of Rs.9,00,000/- paid by way of two cheques by him was\nreturned to him; that he had agreed to destroy the receipt; that the cheques\nwere returned because the vendee wanted a portion of the consideration in\ncash. He handed over a cheque for Rs.5,00,000/-, as agreed on all hands. The\nsame day, he withdrew from the bank a sum of Rs.4,00,000/- and handed over\nthe cash to an agent of the vendor-company. But he could not produce receipt\nfor payment thereof. The District Forum took the view that it would be proper\nto leave the respondent to approach the Civil Court for relief in view of the\nnature of the dispute. The vendee went up in appeal to the State Commission.\nThe State Commission remanded the complaint to the District Forum to decide\nthe dispute. The District Forum passed an order giving liberty to the E\nrespondent to pay a sum of Rs.3,40,890/- along with interest at 15% per\nannum till the date of payment and to obtain possession of the office premises\nin question within a period of two months from the date of receipt of that\njudgment and directed the company to handover vacant possession of the\npremises. Aggrieved, the respondent appealed to the State Commission. The\ncompany filed a belated appeal but the delay was refused to be condoned.\nTherefore, the decision of the District Forum as against the company became\nfinal. The company filed a revision before the National Commission, which\nwas dismissed by it. Hence the present appeal.\nAllowing the appeal, the Court\nD\nF\nG\nHELD: 1.1. When the terms of the transaction are reduced to writing,\nit is impossible to lead evidence to contradict its terms in view of Section 91\nof the Evidence Act. There is no case that any of the provisos to Section 92 of\nthe Act are attracted in this case. Why the case that was sought to be spoken\nto by the respondent was not set up by him in the complaint was not explained. H\n926\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 2 S.C.R.\nA The case set up in evidence was completely at variance with the case in the\ncomplaint. There was no evidence to show that the consideration was to be\nRs.9,00,000/-, especially, in the light of the recitals in the registered\nagreement. There was also no document to show the payment of\nRs.4,00,000/- by way of cash. Hence, there was no evidence to show that the\nbalance amount due under the agreement after the admitted payment of\nRs.5,00,000/- was paid. The affidavit produced before the State Forum and\nthe evidence of the colleague of the respondent is clearly inadmissible and\ninsufficient to prove any such payment. Thus, the case set up by the respondent\nin his evidence was not established. [Para 15] [931-C-F]\nB\nC\n1.2. Neither the State Commission, nor the National Commission has\ngiven any sustainable reason for differing from the conclusion of the District\nForum. A mere suspicion that builders in the country are prone to take a\npart of the sale amount in cash, is no ground to accept the story of payment\nof Rs.4,00,000/- especially when such a payment had not even been set up in\nthe complaint before the District Forum. Not only that, there was no\nD independent evidence to support the payment of such a sum of Rs.4,00,000/-\nexcept the ipse dixit of the respondent. The affidavit of the bank employee\nfiled in the State Commission cannot certainly be accepted as evidence of such\na payment. Payment of such a sum had clearly been denied by the company.\nThe respondent had, therefore, to prove such a payment. [Para 15]\nE\n[931-G-H; 932-A]\n1.3. Not only that the respondent did not have a receipt for evidencing\nthe payment of Rs.4,00,000/- and if the amount was paid on 5.7.1997 or\n8.7.1997, as claimed by him, he would certainly have ensured that the payment\nwas acknowledged in the agreement for sale executed on 27.7.1997. The\nF agreement for sale actually speaks of his obligation to pay the balance to make\nup Rs.7,75,000/- after acknowledging receipt of Rs. 5,00,000/-. The\nrespondent is not a layman. He is a practising advocate. According to him, he\nspecialises in documentation. He cannot, therefore, plead ignorance about the\nexistence of the recital in the agreement. He cannot plead ignorance of its\nimplications. Hence, the decision of the National Commission and that\nG of the State Commission are set aside and that of the District Forum restored.\n[Paras 15 and 17] [932-B-C-E]\nCIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 866 of 2007.\nFrom the Judgment and Final Order dated 12.10.2006 of the National\nH Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, New Delhi in R.P.

This appeal challenges the decision of the National Consumer Disputes\nRedressal Commission.\nB\n3. The appellant is a construction company. The respondent sought to\nC\npurchase an office room in the third floor of a building being constructed by\nthe appellant. The parties agreed to sell and purchase. According to the\ncompany the purchase price was fixed at Rs.7,75,000/-. Documentation,\nregistration and other expenses were to be borne by the respondent\nRs.5,00,000/- was paid by cheque. The balance due, was Rs. 3,41,190/-. The\nrespondent had not paid the said sum. The sale transaction was, therefore, D\nnot complete. The room was not put in the possession of the respondent. The\nterms of the transaction were reduced to writing by an agreement dated\n27.7.1997.\n4.The respondent approached the District Consumer Redressal Forum\nwith a complaint. His case as per his amended complaint was as follows:\nE\nF\nOn 4.7.1997 the company agreed to sell a room having an area of 260\nsq.ft. for a price of Rs.9,00,110/-. The amount was paid in a lump. Receipt for\nRs.9,00,110/- was issued. The company issued an allotment letter dated 22.7.1997.\nOn 31.7.1997 the agreement was executed. In spite of repeated demands after\ncompletion of the construction, the company did not put him in possession.\nThe company was demanding extra amounts. It avoided handing over of\npossession. It issued a notice intending to terminate the agreement. Since\npossession was not given and the company attempted to sell the premises\nto someone else, he suffered losses which were shown as amounting to\nRs.4,84,000. He was, therefore, entitled to recover a sum of Rs.4,84,000/- as G\ncompensation. He was entitled to an order restraining the company from\ntransferring the office room bearing No.309, to any other person. The company\nwas liable to be directed not to create any obstruction in his taking possession\nof office room No.309. The company was to be directed to remove the lock\nit had put at the door of the room.\nH\nA\nB\n928\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 2 S.C.R.\n5. It is seen that on 4.7.1997 the respondent handedover two cheques\nbearing No.299667 and 299678 to the company for a total sum of\nRs.9,00,000/-. He paid a sum of Rs.110/- in cash. He obtained a receipt. Cheque`\nNo.299667 was for Rs.7,50,000/- and cheque No.299668 was for\nRs.1,50,000/-. The parties agree that these two cheques were not encashed,\nbut were returned to the respondent. According to the company, the\nrespondent agreed to destroy the receipt for Rs.9,00,110/- issued in that\nbehalf, by the company. The case of the company is that the cheques were\nreturned because the purchase price was something less than Rs.9,00,000/-\nand it was found to be only Rs.7,75,000/-. In view of this, the respondent on\n8.7.1997, issued a fresh cheque to the company, bearing No.299669, for a sum\nC of Rs.5,00,000/-. That cheque was encashed by the company. The parties\nreduced the transaction into writing. As per that agreement, the payment of\nRs.5,00,000/- by cheque dated 8.7.1997 and its receipt was acknowledged. A\nsum of Rs.1,25,000/- was to be paid by 15.8.1997. Another sum of\nRs.1,25,000/- was to be paid by 19.9.1997. Rs.25,000/- was to be paid at the\ntime of transfer of possession. A sum of Rs.150/- per sq. ft. by way of deposit\nfor meeting the maintenance charges, was also to be paid. The payment by\nthe purchaser was to be the essence of the contract. The total purchase price\nwas shown in the agreement as Rs.7,75,000/-.\nD\nE\nF\n6. Before the District Forum, the company denied the case of the\nrespondent and set up in defence the written agreement between the parties.\nIt pleaded that in spite of being called upon to do so, the respondenthad not\npaid the balance amount due. The company, therefore, terminated the\nagreement. The respondent was not entitled to any relief. The sum of\nRs.5,00,000/- received by cheque had been returned to the respondent and the\ncheque issued in that behalf was received by him.\n7. In his evidence before the District Forum, the respondent made a\ndeparture from the complaint regarding consideration. He admitted that the\nsum of Rs.9,00,000/- paid by way of two cheques by him on 4.7.1997, was\nreturned to him. He had agreed to destroy the receipt. He said that the\ncheques were returned because the Director of the company wanted a portion\nG of the consideration in cash. He wanted Rs.5,00,000/- by way of cheque and\nRs.4,00,000/- by way of cash. The respondent handed over a cheque for\nRs.5,00,000/-, as agreed on all hands. The same day, he withdrew from the\nbank a sum of Rs.4,00,000/- by cash and handed it over to one Thanekar who\nwas an agent of the company. But the respondent produced no receipt for\nH payment of this amount, though such a payment was denied by the company.\nBHANDARI CONSTRUCTION COMPANY v. NARAYAN GOPAL UPADHYE [BALASUBRAMANYAN, J.] 929\n8. Before the District Forum, the respondent gave up his claim for A\ncompensation and pressed only the relief of getting possession of the building\non the basis that he had paid the entire consideration. Of course, he tried to\nsay that he had already been put in possession and his possession was being\ninterfered with by the company. The District Forum took the view that it\nwould be proper to leave the respondent to approach the Civil Court for relief\nB\nin view of the nature of the dispute. The complaint was, therefore, dismissed.\nThe respondent went up in appeal to the State Commission. The State\nCommission remanded the complaint to the District Forum to decide the\ndispute. It took the view that it was not necessary or proper to refer the\ncomplainant to a suit. Thus, the matter came back to the District Forum.\nC\nᎠ\n9. Before the District Forum, further evidence was taken. The complainant\nand the representative of the company were cross-examined on the affidavits\nfiled by them. The District Forum found that the respondent had not established\nthat he had paid the entire consideration of Rs.7,75,000/-. According to the\nDistrict Forum, the written agreement governed the relationship between the\nparties. There was also no evidence to prove the payment of Rs.4,00,000/- in\ncash as claimed by the respondent. The payment of Rs.5,00,000/- out of the\npurchase price of Rs.7,75,000/- by way of cheque alone was established.\nThough the same had been returned to the respondent by way of a cheque,\nhe had not encashed it. The District Forum therefore passed an order giving\nliberty to the respondent to pay a sum of Rs.3,40,890/- along with interest at E\n15% per annum from 3.9.1999 till the date of payment and to obtain possession\nof the office premises in question within a period of two months from the date\nof receipt of that judgment and directed the company to handover vacant\npossession of the premises within a period of two months from the date of\nreceipt of the amount. But alternatively, it gave liberty to the respondent to F\ndemand from the company the refund of Rs.5,00,000/- along with interest at\n15% per annum from 8.7.1997 till the date of realisation by issue of a notice\nin that behalf to the company. On receipt of such a notice the amount was\nto be paid by the company within two months of its receipt.\n10. The respondent, feeling aggrieved, appealed to the State Commission. G\nThe company, it is said filed a belated appeal but the delay was refused to\nbe condoned. Therefore, the decision of the District Forum as against the\ncompany became final.\n11. The State Commission proceeded to accept an affidavit filed by an\nemployee of the bank on which a self cheque was drawn by the respondent.\nH\n།\n930\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 2 S.C.R.\nA The allegation in that affidavit was that a self cheque for Rs.4,00,000/- was\nencashed by the respondent and the amount was handed over to Thanekar,\nan agent of the company. That allegation was accepted. No opportunity was\nprovided to the company to cross-examine the employee. The State Commission\nmodified the decision of the District Forum. It directed the company to\nhandover the premises to the respondent on the basis that the entire\nconsideration had been paid. It also ordered that the company had to pay\ninterest at 6% per annum on the sum of Rs.9,00,110/-. The order of the State\nCommission is seen to be cursory. It had not even referred to the relevant\npleadings and the evidence, before interfering with the order of the District\nForum. It is difficult to understand its reasoning.\nB\nC\nD\n12. The company filed a revision before the National Commission. The\ncompany pointed out the variance between the case set up by the respondent\nin his complaint and in his evidence. It pointed out that the terms of the\ntransaction having been reduced to writing, it was not open to the respondent\nto lead evidence in variation thereof. It also pointed out that the evidence\nattempted to be given was also at variance with the case set up. It pointed\nout that there was no receipt evidencing the alleged payment of Rs.4,00,000/\n- to the company. The payment was not proved. All the other payments had\nbeen acknowledged by receipts. The State Forum was, therefore, in error in\ninterfering with the order of the District Forum. It was also submitted that\nE during the pendency of the proceedings, the premises had been transferred\nto some other person and hence the company should be relieved of its\nobligation to deliver the premises. The respondent reiterated his contention\nthat he had paid a sum of Rs.9,00,000/- to the company. He also appears to\nhave made some general submissions on the tendency of builders to receive\nFpart of the sale price in cash.\n1\n13. The National Commission brushed aside the contentions of the\ncompany. It did not place due emphasis on the case set up by the respondent\nin his complaint and the total departure from that case made in his evidence.\nIt ignored the fact that the agreement between the parties having been\nG reduced to writing there was a bar against leading evidence contradicting its\nterms. Decrying what it termed the attitude of builders in demanding part of\nthe sale price in cash, the National Commission dismissed the revision. This\nis what is challenged in this appeal by the company.\nH\n14. We find that the respondent had totally given up the case set up\nby him in his complaint while giving evidence. The transaction on 4.7.1997\n人\n+\nBHANDARI CONSTRUCTION COMPANY ». NARAYAN GOPAL UPADHYE [BALASUBRAMANYAN, J.] 931\nas set up by the respondent was given up by him. He also admitted that the A\ntwo cheques handed over for Rs.9,00,000/- that day, were not encashed by\nthe appellant. He admitted that they were returned. He further admitted that\nthe receipt for Rs.9,00,000/- issued to him was in respect of those two returned\ncheques. He also admitted that he had thereafter issued a cheque for\nRs.5,00,000/-. He agreed that a sum of Rs.5,00,000/- by way of a cheque was B\nreturned to him by the company. But he had not encashed it. He admitted the\nagreement dated 27.7.1997 and the terms thereof and the factum of its\nregistration on 31.7.1997. He also admitted that he had no receipt to show the\npayment of Rs.4,00,000/- in cash.\n15. When the terms of the transaction are reduced to writing, it is C\nimpossible to lead evidence to contradict its terms in view of Section 91 of\nthe Evidence Act. There is no case that any of the provisos to Section 92\nof the Act are attracted in this case. Why the case that was sought to be\nspoken to by the respondent was not set up by him in the complaint was not\n-\nexplained. The case set up in evidence was completely at variance with the D\ncase in the complaint. There was no evidence to show that the consideration\nwas to be Rs.9,00,000/-, especially, in the light of the recitals in the registered\nagreement. There was also no document to show the payment of Rs.4,00,000/\n- by way of cash. Hence, this was no evidence to show that the balance\namount due under the agreement after the admitted payment of Rs.5,00,000/\nwas paid. The affidavit produced before the State Forum and the evidence E\nof the colleague of the respondent is clearly inadmissible and insufficient to\nprove any such payment. Thus, the case set up by the respondent in his\nevidence was not established. It is in that situation that the District Forum\ntaking note of the payment of Rs.5,00,000/- and the failure of the respondent\nto encash the cheque for Rs.5,00,000/- that was returned by the company, F\nordered the complainant to pay the balance amount due under the transaction\nas evidenced by the written instrument and take delivery of the premises in\nquestion and in the alternative gave him the option to take back the sum of\nRs.5,00,000/- with interest. Neither the State Commission, nor the National\nCommission has given any sustainable reason for differing from the conclusion\nof the District Forum. A mere suspicion that builders in the country are prone\nto take a part of the sale amount in cash, is no ground to accept the story\nof payment of Rs.4,00,000/- especially when such a payment had not even\nbeen set up in the complaint before the District Forum. Not only that, there\nG\nwas no independent evidence to support the payment of such a sum of\nRs.4,00,000/- except the ipse dixit of the respondent. The affidavit of the bank H\nemployee filed in the State Commission cannot certainly be accepted as\nT\n932\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 2 S.C.R.\nA evidence of such a payment. Payment of such a sum had clearly been denied\nby the company. The respondent had, therefore, to prove such a payment.\nHis case that the purchase price was Rs.9,00,000/-, itself stands discredited\nby the recitals in the agreement dated 27.7.1997 in which the purchase price\nwas recited as Rs.7,75,000/-. Not only that the respondent did not have a\nB receipt for evidencing the payment of Rs.4,00,000/- and if the amount was paid\non 5.7.1997 or 8.7.1997, as claimed by him, he would certainly have ensured\nthat the payment was acknowledged in the agreement for sale executed on\n27.7.1997. The agreement for sale actually speaks of his obligation to pay the\nbalance to make up Rs.7,75,000/- after acknowledging receipt of\nRs.5,00,000/-. The respondent is not a layman. He is a practising advocate.\nAccording to him, he specialises in documentation. He cannot, therefore,\nplead ignorance about the existence of the recital in the agreement. He cannot\nplead ignorance of its implications.\nC\nD\nE\n16. We were taken through the entire material. The respondent who\nappeared in person, brought to our notice the evidence in extenso. At the end\nof it all, we find that we cannot agree either with the State Commission or with\nthe National Commission. Actually, the District Forum had been indulgent to\nthe respondent in giving him the relief it did. Suffice it to say, we find it\nimpossible to sustain the decision of the National Commission.\n17. Hence, we allow this appeal. We set aside the decision of the\nNational Commission and that of the State Commission. We restore the decision\nof the District Forum. Normally, we would have ordered the cost of the appeal\nto the company, but since the respondent appeared in-person, we refrain from\nordering it. The parties will bear their costs in this Court.\nF\nS.K.S.\nAppeal allowed.\n"}
