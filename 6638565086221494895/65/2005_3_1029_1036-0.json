PREM CHAND VIJAY KUMAR\nV.\nYASH PAL SINGH AND ANR.\nMAY 2, 2005\n[ARIJIT PASAYAT AND S.H. KAPADIA, JJ.]\nNegotiable Instruments Act, 1881: Sections 138 and 142-Dishonour of\ncheque-Cause of action to file complaint on dishonour of cheque despite\nissue of notice arise only once-Once notice is received by drawer, the payee\nforfeits his right to again present the cheque as cause of action had already\narisen and period of limitation begun to run-Giving of second notice would\nnot then give rise to fresh cause of action.\nWords and Phrases-Cause of action-Meaning of in the Context of\nSection 142 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.\nRespondents issued a cheque in favour of the appellant for the value\nof goods supplied. On presentation of cheque in bank, it was dishonoured\ndue to inadequacy of funds. Appellant sent notice to the respondents\ndemanding payment. On the request of the respondents, the cheque was\nagain presented and was dishonoured due to inadequacy of funds.\nAppellant sent another notice, but respondent failed again. Appellant filed\ncomplaint under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.\nRespondents filed an application for discharge which was dismissed by the\ntrial court. On a petition filed under section 482 Cr.P.C, High Court\nquashed the proceedings, holding that the requirement of Section 142 of\nthe Act were not met. Hence the present appeal.\nDismissing the appeal, the Court\nHELD 1. Clause (a) of the proviso to Section 138 of Negotiable\nInstruments Act, 1881 does not put any embargo upon the payee to\nsuccessively present a dishonoured cheque during the period of its validity.\nOn each presentation of the cheque and its dishonour, a fresh right - and\nnot a cause of action - accrues in his favour. He may, therefore, without\ntaking pre-emptory action in exercise of his such right under clause (b)\nof Section 138, go on presenting the cheque so as to enable him to exercise\nsuch right at any point of time during the validity of the cheque. But once\n1029\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n1030\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2005] 3 S.C.R.\nA he gives a notice under clause (b) of Section 138, he forfeits such right in\ncase of failure of the drawer to pay the money within the stipulated time,\nand the cause of action for filing the complaint will arise. [1034-C-F]\n2.1. In a generic and wide sense (as in Section 20 CPC) “cause of\naction” means every fact which it is necessary to establish to support a\nB right or obtain a judgment. However clause (b) of Section 142 gives a\nrestrictive meaning to the term 'cause of action'. It refers to only one fact\nwhich will give rise to the cause of action and that is the failure to make\nthe payment within 15 days from the date of receipt of the notice. A\ncombined reading of Sections 138 and 142 makes it clear that cause of\nC action within the meaning of Section 142(c) arises - and can arise - only\nonce. The period of one month for filing the complaint will be reckoned\nfrom the day immediately following the day on which the period of fifteen\ndays from the date of receipt of the notice by the drawer expires.\nD\nE\n[1034-G; 1035-C-E]\n2.2. Once a notice under clause (b) of Section 138 of the Act is\n\"received\" by the drawer of the cheque, the payee or holder of the cheque\nforfeits his right to again present the cheque as cause of action has accrued\nwhen there was failure to pay the amount within the prescribed period\nand the period of limitation starts to run which cannot be stopped on any\naccount. One of the indispensable factors to form the cause of action\nenvisaged in Section 138 of the Act is contained in clause (b) of the proviso\nto that section. It involves the making of a demand by giving a notice in\nwriting to the drawer of the cheque “within fifteen days of the receipt of\ninformation by him from the bank regarding the return of the cheque as\nunpaid”. If no such notice is given within the said period of 15 days, no\nF cause of action could have been created at all. Thus, it is well settled that\nif dishonour of a cheque has once snowballed into a cause of action it is\nnot permissible for a payee to create another cause of action with the same\ncheque.

YASH PAL SINGH [PASAYAT, J.] 1031\nFrom the Judgment and Order dated 1.12.2003 of the Punjab and A\nHaryana High Court in Crl.M. No. 10748-M of 2002.\nHiren Dasan, Chanchal Kumar Ganguli and Rajnish Gupta for the\nAppellant.\nAmit Singh Chhadha and Pradeep Kumar Bakshi for the Respondents. B\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nARIJIT PASAYAT, J. Leave granted.\nChallenge in this appeal is to the legality of the judgment rendered by C\na learned Single Judge of the Punjab and Haryana High Court holding that\nthe proceedings initiated on the basis of a complaint alleging infraction of\nSection 138 of the Negotiable Instrument Act, 1881 (in short the ‘Act') was\nnot maintainable. Therefore, the proceedings were quashed, allowing the\npetition filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (in D\nshort 'the Code').\nBackground facts filtering out unnecessary details are as under :\nThe complaint was filed by the appellant alleging that in the year 1995\nrespondent no.1 had issued a cheque for a sum of Rs. 5,15,053.72 representing E\nbalance amount payable to the appellant for supply of goods to a partnership\nfirm of which respondents are partners. It was indicated that the total amount\npayable was Rs. 49,21,482.72 as against which the accused persons had paid\nRs. 44,06,429/-, leaving balance of Rs. 5,15,053.72. A cheque [drawn on\nOriental Bank of Commerce, Ladwa branch (Account no.954)] was issued for\nF\nthe same amount on 27.1.1995. The cheque was signed by respondent no.1\nYashpal Singh, for the firm and respondent no.2 Nirpal Singh, was a partner\nof the partnership firm, namely, M/s Sat Guru Rice Traders, New Delhi. The\ncheque was dishonoured due to inadequacy of funds in the account. Intimation\nwas given on 6.2.1995. Notice was issued by the appellant demanding payment\nby lawyer's notice dated 17.2.1995. The amount was not paid. The respondents G\nrequested the appellant for some time to make the payment. On the request\nof the respondents, the cheque was again presented on 6.7.1995 and it was\nagain dishonoured due to inadequacy of funds. Intimation in this regard was\nsent to the appellant on 10.7.1995. Again, lawyer's notice was sent on\n24.7.1995. Reply was sent by the respondents on 16.8.1995 refuting the\nH\n1\n1032\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2005] 3 S.C.R.\nA allegations contained in the legal notice. The complaint was lodged on\n28.8.1995. Charges were framed.\nRespondent filed an application for discharge which was dismissed by\nthe trial court by order dated 29.1.2002. The order was challenged before the\nHigh Court which by the impugned judgment held that the requirements of\nB Section 142 of the Act were not met.\nC\nIn support of the appeal, learned counsel for the appellant submitted\nthat the High Court was not right in entertaining the petition under Section\n482 of the Code. The High Court lost sight of the fact that the application\nwas filed by the respondents long after the charges were framed. High Court\nhas erroneously placed reliance on this Court's decision in Sadanandan\nBhadran v. Madhavan Sunil Kumar, [1998] 6 SCC 514. On the contrary, the\ndecision in Dalmia Cement (Bharat) Ltd. v. Galaxy Traders \u0026 Agencies Ltd.\nand Ors., [2001] 6 SCC 463 is applicable. The period of limitation has to be\nreckoned from 10.8.1995 i.e. the date on which the respondents-accused\nD persons replied to the legal notice dated 24.7.1995. As the complaint was\nfiled on 28.8.1995 the same was well within time. It was submitted that the\nrespondent-accused persons categorically stated in their reply dated 10.8.1995\nthat the first notice had not been served on them.\nLearned counsel for the respondent-accused persons on the other hand,\nE submitted that the High Court had rightly taken the view that the requirements\nof Section 142 were not met. It was pointed out that the effect of the first\nnotice was lost in view of the fact that the second notice was given. The High\nCourt has rightly applied the ratio in Sadanandan Bhadran's case (supra). It\nis not in dispute that there was issuance and receipt of the lawyer's notices\nF on both the occasions. In fact, the acknowledgement of service of first notice\nhas been filed by the complainant-appellant himself and at all stages the case\nproceeded on the footing that the first notice had been issued and served. The\nHigh Court has categorically noted that the first notice had been served on\nthe respondent. With reference to the complaint it was submitted that the\nappellant himself accepted that the first notice had been served. Therefore, he\ncannot be permitted to take the different stand that the notice was not served\nand in any event the second notice did not provide the cause of action.\nG\nFor resolution of the controversy Sections 138 and 142 of the Act are\nrelevant. They read as follows:\nH\n-\n1\nPREM CHAND VIJAY KUMAR v. YASH PAL SINGH [PASAYAT, J.] 1033\n\"Section 138 :\n-\nA\nDishonour of cheque for insufficiency, etc. of funds in the account\nWhere any cheque drawn by a person on an account maintained by\nhim with a banker for payment of any amount of money to another\nperson from out of that account for the discharge, in whole or in part,\nof any debt or other liability, is returned by the bank unpaid, either B\nbecause of the amount of money standing to the credit of that account\nis insufficient to honour the cheque or that it exceeds the amount\narranged to be paid from that account by an agreement made with\nthat bank, such person shall be deemed to have committed an offence\nand shall, without prejudice to any other provision of this Act, be\npunished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one\nyear, or with fine which may extend to twice the amount of the\ncheque, or with both :\nProvided that nothing contained in this section shall apply unless -\nC\n(a) the cheque has been presented to the bank within a period of six D\nmonths from the date on which it is drawn or within the period of its\nvalidity, whichever is earlier;\n(b) the payee or the holder in due course of the cheque, as the case\nmay be, makes a demand for the payment of the said amount of\nmoney by giving a notice in writing, to the drawer of the cheque,\nwithin fifteen days of the receipt of information by him from the\nbank regarding the return of the cheque as unpaid; and\n(c) the drawer of such cheque fails to make the payment of the said\namount of money to the payee or as the case may be, to the holder\nE\nin due course of the cheque within fifteen days of the receipt of the F\nsaid notice.\nExplanation - For the purposes of this section, \"debt or other liability\"\nmeans a legally enforceable debt or other liability.\nSection 142 :\nG\nCognizance of offences - Notwithstanding anything contained in the\nCode of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974), -\n(a) no court shall take cognizance of any offence punishable under\nSection 138 except upon a complaint, in writing, made by the payee H\n1\n1034\nA\nB\nC\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2005] 3 S.C.R.\nor, as the case may be, the holder in due course of the cheque;\n(b) such complaint is made within one month of the date on which\nthe cause of action arises under clause (c) of the proviso to Section\n138;\n(Provided that the cognizance of a complaint may be taken by the\nCourt after the prescribed period, if the complainant satisfies the\nCourt that he had sufficient cause for not making a complaint within\nsuch period.)\n(c) no court inferior to that of a Metropolitan Magistrate or a Judicial\nMagistrate of the first class shall try any offence punishable under\nSection 138.\"\nClause (a) of the proviso to Section 138 does not put any embargo\nupon the payee to successively present a dishonoured cheque during the\nperiod of its validity. This apart, in the course of business transactions it is\nD not uncommon for a cheque being returned due to insufficient funds or\nsimilar such reasons and being presented again by the payee after sometime,\non his own volition or at the request of the drawer, in expectation that it\nwould be encashed. The primary interest of the payee is to get his money and\nnot prosecution of the drawer, recourse to which, normally, is taken out of\ncompulsion and not choice. On each presentation of the cheque and its\ndishonour, a fresh right-and not a cause of action - accrues in his favour. He\nmay, therefore, without taking pre-emptory action in exercise of his such\nright under clause (b) of Section 138, go on presenting the cheque so as to\nenable him to exercise such right at any point of time during the validity of\nthe cheque.\nE\nF\nG\nH\nBut once he gives a notice under clause (b) of Section 138, he forfeits\nsuch right in case of failure of the drawer to pay the money within the\nstipulated time, he would be liable for offence and the cause of action for\nfiling the complaint will arise.\nIn a generic and wide sense (as in Section 20 of the Civil Procedure\nCode, 1908 (in short ‘CPC') “cause of action” means every fact which it is\nnecessary to establish to support a right or obtain a judgment. Viewed in that\ncontext, the following facts are required to be proved to successfully prosecute\nthe drawer for an offence under Section 138 of the Act:\n(a) that the cheque was drawn for payment of an amount of money\n'\n1\nPREM CHAND VIJAY KUMAR v. YASH PAL SINGH [PASAYAT, J.] 1035\nfor discharge of a debt/liability and the cheque was dishonoured;\n(b) that the cheque was presented within the prescribed period;\n(c) that the payee made a demand for payment of the money by\ngiving a notice in writing to the drawer within the stipulated period;\nand\n(d) that the drawer failed to make the payment within 15 days of the\nreceipt of the notice.\nA\nB\nC\nProceeding on the basis of the generic meaning of the term \"cause of action”,\ncertainly each of the above facts would constitute a part of the cause of\naction but clause (b) of Section 142 gives it a restrictive meaning, in that, it\nrefers to only one fact which will give rise to the cause of action and that is\nthe failure to make the payment within 15 days from the date of the receipt\nof the notice. A combined reading of Sections 138 and 142 makes it clear\nthat cause of action is to be reckoned accordingly. The combined reading of\nthe above two sections of the Act leaves no room for doubt that cause of D\naction within the meaning of Section 142(c) arises - and can arise - only\nonce.\nThe period of one month for filing the complaint will be reckoned from\nthe day immediately following the day on which the period of fifteen days\nfrom the date of the receipt of the notice by the drawer expires.\nAs noted in Sadanandan Bhadran's case (supra) once a notice under\nclause (b) of Section 138 of the Act is \"received\" by the drawer of the\ncheque, the payee or holder of the cheque forfeits his right to again present\nthe cheque as cause of action has accrued when there was failure to pay the\namount within the prescribed period and the period of limitation starts to run\nwhich cannot be stopped on any account.\nOne of the indispensable factors to form the cause of action envisaged\nin Section 138 of the Act is contained in clause (b) of the proviso to that\nsection. It involves the making of a demand by giving a notice in writing to\nthe drawer of the cheque \"within fifteen days of the receipt of information\nby him from the bank regarding the return of the cheque as unpaid\". If no\nsuch notice is given within the said period of 15 days, no cause of action\ncould have been created at all.\nE\nF\nG\nThus, it is well settled that if dishonour of a cheque has once snowballed H\n1036\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2005] 3 S.C.R.\nA into a cause of action it is not permissible for a payee to create another cause\nof action with the same cheque.\nIn Sil Import, USA v. Exim Aides Silk Exporters, Bangalore, [1999] 4\nSCC 567, it was held that the language used in Section 142 admits of no\ndoubt that the magistrate is forbidden from taking cognizance of the offence\nB if the complaint was not filed within one month of the date on which the\ncause of action arose. Completion of the offence is the immediate forerunner\nof rising of the cause of action. In other words, cause of action would arise\nsoonafter completion of the offence and period of limitation for filing of the\napplication starts simultaneously running.\nC\nD\nIt is to be noted that though a somewhat confusing statement was made\nby the respondents regarding the receipt of the first lawyer's notice. Therefore,\nwhat was kept alive was a fresh right and not cause of action. Therefore,\nSadanandan Bhadran's case (supra) was rightly applied. The impugned\njudgment does not suffer from any infirmity to warrant interference.\nD.G.\nThe appeal is dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed.\n"}
