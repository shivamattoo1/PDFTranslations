As both the appeals arise from the common judgment\ndelivered by the Madras High Court on August 10, 2006 and\ncommon question of facts and law arise for consideration of\nthis Court, it is proposed to dispose them of by this common\njudgment.\n5. In order to trace the development of events leading to\nfiling of these appeals, it is necessary to notice certain basic\nfacts.\n6. Background\nThe existing Port of Pondicherry is situated in the East\nCoast of India between two Major Ports of India, i.e., Madras.\nand Tuticorin. It is located at the Ariankuppam River Mouth in\nPondicherry. The history of the Pondicherry Port dates back to\nthe tenth century A.D. The Pondicherry Port flourished as a\ncentre for international trade and commerce. However, it could\nnot maintain the pace of augmentation in improving the port\nfacilities with respect to the rapid changes in transport\ntechnology. Therefore, the port facilities became obsolete and\nthe Port lost much of its importance.\nWith the objective of developing the port facilities, offers\nfrom various Marine Technical Consultancy Firms were invited\nby the Government of Pondicherry in the year 1973 for the\npreparation of a Master Plan and a detailed project report. After\nF examining the offers received from various firms, the Port\nDepartment of Government of Pondicherry recommended that\nthe project be awarded to M/s. Consulting Engineers Services\n(India) Pvt. Ltd. By Government order dated September 27,\n1973 the said organization was entrusted with the work of\nG preparation of the Master Plan and a detailed project report.\nThe said organization submitted various reports and finally\nupdated its project report in May, 1982. On the basis of the\nreports, the Ministry of Shipping and Transportation (Ports\nWing), Government of India approved the project for the\ncreation of certain facilities at the Pondicherry Port and\nH\nt\nVILLIANUR IYARKKAI PADUKAPPU MAIYAM v. 249\nUNION OF INDIA AND ORS. [J.M. PANCHAL, J.]\nsanctioned the cost of the project by letter dated June 26, 1984. A\nThe Government of Pondicherry entered into an agreement with\nM/s. Consulting Engineering Services (India) Private Limited\non January 22, 1985 for development of the facilities in terms\nof the approval and sanction granted by the Government of\nIndia. During the construction of the facilities, there was a\nproposal to create additional development facilities for\nCommercial-cum-Fishing Vessels.\nB\nD\nThe creation of these additional facilities was discussed\nin a meeting held on March 22, 1989 pursuant to which the\nC\nDirector (Ports), Port Department, Government of Pondicherry\nvide letter dated March 23, 1989 informed the Development\nCommissioner, Government of Pondicherry that creation of\nsuch additional facilities would require a feasibility report. In the\nIsaid letter it was also stated that since the Port Department\nlacked competent personnel in this regard, the same should be\ngot prepared by a body having the requisite expertise. It was\nalso mentioned in the letter that M/s. Consulting Engineering\nServices (India) Private Limited had no requisite expertise and\nrecommended the appointment of M/s. Rail India Technical and\nEconomic Services India Limited, a Government of India E\nundertaking under the Ministry of Railways (\"M/s. RITES India\nLimited\" for short) to conduct the study on the technical\nfeasibility and economic viability of the proposed development\nfacilities. This proposal was examined and approved by various\nofficials including the then Chief Minister of Pondicherry on\nMarch 27, 1989 and the then Lt. Governor, Pondicherry on\nMarch 28, 1989. In terms of those decisions, a Government\norder dated May 29, 1989 was issued by the Government of\nPondicherry sanctioning a techno-economic survey to be\nconducted by M/s. RITES India Limited.\nOn June 10, 1991, M/s. RITES India Limited submitted its\nTechno-Economic Feasibility Study Report pertaining to the\nDevelopment of the additional facilities at Ariankuppam Port\nProject. The said report noticed that the proposed development\nF\nG\nH\nâ˜‘\nT\n250 SUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2009] 9 S.C.R.\nA was not only necessary for bridging the gap of technological\nchanges in the sea transport, but was also necessary from the\nsocio-economic point of view. In the report it was mentioned\nthat the investments in the proposed project was justified. By\nthe said report a study to be done on the ways and means of\nB raising the funds for the project was recommended. The report\nalso pointed out that Environmental Impact Assessment for the\nproposed development indicated that the effect on the\nenvironment was not significant and would be well within the\nacceptable levels specified as per the Indian standards.\nC\nIn spite of the positive Feasibility Study Report submitted\nby M/s. RITES India Limited, the project could not be carried\nforward in view of the paucity of funds.\nAgain, some time in March 1996 the Government of\nD Pondicherry made further attempt to develop the Port by inviting\nthe officials of M/s. RITES India Limited to examine and provide\nconsultancy services by privatization of the ports at Pondicherry,\nKaraikal and Mahe. Accordingly, a meeting was held between\nthe officials of Government and the Company on March 12,\nE 1996. In the said meeting the officials of M/s. RITES India\nLimited suggested that appropriate approach was to adopt the\nBuild, Own, Share and Transfer mode of privatization. In terms\nof the said meeting M/s.RITES India Limited, through a letter\ndated March 12, 1996, submitted a 'Terms of Reference' for\nF offering consultancy assignment for privatization of\naforementioned ports. The total consultancy fee for the\nassignments was initially put as Rs.30 lakhs, which was\nreduced to Rs.20 lakhs as the proposal for consultancy was\nsubsequently limited to the Pondicherry Port only. The Joint\nSecretary, Ministry of Surface Transport, Government of India,\nvide letter dated March 22, 1996 informed the Chief Secretary,\nPondicherry Administration about the need to expand the\nexisting capacity of the Pondicherry Port to meet the growth\nrequirement of traffic handled by various major ports. In the said\nletter it was mentioned that a decision was taken to invite capital\nG\nH\n1\nVILLIANUR IYARKKAI PADUKAPPU MAIYAM v.\nUNION OF INDIA AND ORS. [J.M. PANCHAL, J.]\n251\nparticipation by private sector and from non-maritime land- A\nlocked states. In response to the said letter the Director of Ports,\nGovernment of Pondicherry addressed a letter dated April 18,\n1996 enclosing therein the material for inviting capital\nparticipation by the private sector and non-maritime land-locked\nstates.\nB\nOne company, i.e., Megah Verture Lines (M) SDN BHD\nvide letter dated March 28, 1996 addressed to the Secretary\n(Health \u0026 Welfare and Port), Government of Pondicherry,\nreferred to the discussion it had on March 28, 1996 and made\nC\na proposal to conduct a Feasibility Study relating to the\nmodernization/privatization of the Pondicherry Port. The said\ncompany wanted permission to conduct the said Feasibility\nStudy. The said proposal was examined by the Director (Ports),\nGovernment of Pondicherry and by letter dated April 19, 1996,\nthe Director (Ports), Government of Pondicherry, recommended*\nthat as the entire privatization of port was being examined by\nM/s. RITES India Limited, the study sought to be conducted by\nM/s. Megah Ventures Lines should be permitted only after\ntenders for privatization were invited by M/s. RITES India\nLimited.\nThe Managing Director of M/s. Mega Ventures Lines along\nwith letter dated January 25, 1997, addressed the then Chief\nMinister, Pondicherry, enclosed a draft of MOU pursuant to the\nmeeting which had taken place between the then Chief Minister\nand the officials of M/s. Megah Ventures Lines on January 23,\n1997 and claimed that the same was in accordance with the\neconomic policy of the Government of India. The benefits, which\nwere to accrue, were also mentioned in the said letter. The\nDirector of Ports, Government of Pondicherry, by his letter dated\nJune 24, 1997, made a proposal to the Under Secretary (Ports),\nPondicherry to examine the issue as to whether it would be\npreferable to call for competitive tenders. It was also mentioned\nin the said letter that in the meanwhile M/s. RITES India Limited\nbe approached for consultancy services. By the said letter the\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n1\nC\nD\n252 SUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2009] 9 S.C.R.\nA Director of Ports also proposed that M/s. RITES India Limited\nbe appointed as the consultant for the assignment of selection\nof suitable entrepreneurs for 'additional development facilities\nof Ariankuppam Port Project' by competitive tenders on\nBOOST basis. The Director also requested for sanction of\nB Rs.14 lakhs as expenditure. On September 19, 1997 a meeting\nwas held between the senior officials of the Government of\nPondicherry and the Group General Manager of M/s. RITES\nIndia Limited. The minutes of the meeting recorded that due to\nresource crunch at the Centre and State level, the Government\nof Pondicherry had decided to invite private participation for\nthe development of Pondicherry Port. The minutes also reflected\nthat a decision was taken to call for pre-qualifications bids in\norder to ascertain the technical capacity and financial\nsoundness of the entrepreneurs. The minutes also indicated that\na decision was taken that in order to invite the best parties, the\nGovernment of Pondicherry should grant concessions at par\nwith other maritime States. On November 4, 1997 a meeting\nwas held between the officials of the Government of Pondicherry\nincluding the then Lt. Governor and the Group General Manager\nof M/s. RITES India Limited. At the said meeting the officials\nof M/s. RITES India Limited gave a detailed presentation\nrelating to various aspects of competitive bidding process. At\nthe said meeting a decision was taken to adopt a transparent\nopen competitive bidding procedure in preference to the MOU\nRoute. The minutes of the said meeting also reflected that a\ndecision relating to the appointment of M/s. RITES India Limited\nas a consultant for this purpose was also taken. The minutes\nfurther recorded that the Pondicherry Port was a minor Port\nand, therefore, the provisions of Major Ports Trust Act were not\napplicable. The draft minutes were, thereafter, approved and\nG signed by the officials of the Government of Pondicherry.\nE\nF\nH\nOn November 6, 1997, a Government Order was issued\nappointing M/s. RITES India Limited as a consultant. The\nConsultancy Service Agreement between the Government of\nPondicherry and M/s.
