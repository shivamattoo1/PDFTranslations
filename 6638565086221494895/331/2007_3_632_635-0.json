Deshpande for the Respondent.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nDR. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. 1. Leave granted.\n2. Challenge in this appeal is to the order passed by the learned Single\nJudge of the Bombay High Court allowing the second appeal filed by the\nrespondent under Section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (in short\n'CPC').\nFactual background in a nutshell is as follows:\nB\nC\n3. The respondent-plaintiff filed a Special civil suit bearing No.2 of 1986\nin the Court of Civil Judge, Sr. Division, Buldana against the appellants-\ndefendants. The Trial Court by the judgment and order dated 19.9.1987 partially\ndecreed the suit. Aggrieved by the judgment and decree of the Trial Court, D\nthe appellants-defendants preferred an appeal in the Court of Additional\nDistrict Judge, Buldana. By judgment and order dated 28.9.1990 the first\nappellate court allowed the appeal and set aside the decree passed by the\nTrial Court. The respondent-plaintiff preferred a second appeal before the\nHigh Court of Bombay, Nagpur Bench. By the impugned judgment the learned\nSingle Judge allowed the second appeal.\n4. Though many points have been urged in support of the appeal, the\nprimary stand of the learned counsel for the appellants is that the second\nappeal was allowed without framing any substantial question of law as\nmandated by Section 100 CPC. Learned counsel for the respondent submitted\nthat though the High Court's judgment does not show that any substantial\nquestion of law was framed yet the learned Single Judge at the time of\nadmission of the second appeal had referred to certain points urged.\n5. Section 100 of CPC deals with \"Second Appeal”. The provision reads\nas follows:\nE\nF\nG\n“Section 100-Second Appeal: (1) Save as otherwise expressly\nprovided in the body of this Code or by any other law for the time\nbeing in force, an appeal shall lie to the High Court from every decree\npassed in appeal by any Court subordinate to the High Court, if the\nHigh Court is satisfied that the case involves a substantial question H\nA\n634\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 3 S.C.R.\nof law.\nf\nB\nC\nD\nᎠ\nE\nF\nG\nH\n(2) An appeal may lie under this section from an appellate decree\npassed ex parte.\n(3) In an appeal under this Section, the memorandum of appeal shall\nprecisely state the substantial question of law involved in the appeal.\n(4) Where the High Court is satisfied that a substantial question of\nlaw is involved in any case, it shall formulate that question.\n(5) The appeal shall be heard on the question so formulated and the\nrespondent shall, at the hearing of the appeal, be allowed to argue\nthat the case does not involve such question:\nProvided that nothing in this sub-section shall be deemed to take\naway or abridge the power of the Court to hear, for reasons to be\nrecorded, the appeal on any other substantial question of law, not\nformulated by it, if it is satisfied that the case involves such question.”\n6. A perusal of the impugned judgment passed by the High Court does\nnot show that any substantial question of law has been formulated or that\nthe second appeal was heard on the question, if any, so formulated. That\nbeing so, the judgment cannot be maintained.\n7. In Ishwar Dass Jain v. Sohan Lal, [2000] 1 SCC 434 this Court in para\n10, has stated thus:\n\"10. Now under Section 100 CPC, after the 1976 Amendment, it is\nessential for the High Court to formulate a substantial question of law\nand it is not permissible to reverse the judgment of the first appellate\nCourt without doing so.\"\n8. Yet again in Roop Singh v. Ram Singh, [2000] 3 SCC 708 this Court\nhas expressed that the jurisdiction of a High Court is confined to appeals\ninvolving substantial question of law. Para 7 of the said judgment reads:\n\"7. It is to be reiterated that under section 100 CPC jurisdiction\nof the High Court to entertain a second appeal is confined only to\nsuch appeals which involve a substantial question of law and it does\nnot confer any jurisdiction on the High Court to interfere with pure\nquestions of fact while exercising its jurisdiction under section 100\nCPC. That apart, at the time of disposing of the matter the High Court\nWYAWAHARE \u0026 SONS v. MADHUKAR RAGHUNATH BHAVE [PASAYAT, J.] 635\ndid not even notice the question of law formulated by it at the time A\nof admission of the second appeal as there is no reference of it in the\nimpugned judgment. Further, the fact findings courts after appreciating\nthe evidence held that the defendant entered into the possession of\nthe premises as a batai, that is to say, as a tenant and his possession\nwas permissive and there was no pleading or proof as to when it\nB\nbecame adverse and hostile. These findings recorded by the two\ncourts below were based on proper appreciation of evidence and the\nmaterial on record and there was no perversity, illegality or irregularity.\nin those findings. If the defendant got the possession of suit land as\na lessee or under a batai agreement then from the permissive possession\nit is for him to establish by cogent and convincing evidence to show C\nhostile animus and possession adverse to the knowledge of the real\nowner. Mere possession for a long time does not result in converting.\npermissive possession into adverse possession Thakur Kishan Singh\nv. Arvind Kumar, [1994] 6 SCC 591. Hence the High Court ought not\nto have interfered with the findings of fact recorded by both the\nD\ncourts below.\"\n9. The position has been reiterated in Kanhaiyalal and Ors. v.\nAnupkumar and Ors., [2003] 1 SCC 430, Mathakala Krishnaiah v. V.\nRajagopal, [2004] 10 SCC 676, Smt. Ram Sakhi Devi v.
