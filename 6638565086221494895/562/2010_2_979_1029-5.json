{"pages":[{"pageNumber":51}],"text":"-\nSTATE OF WEST BENGAL v. COMMITTEE FOR PROTECTION 1029\nOF DEMOCRATIC RIGHTS, WEST BENGAL [D.K. JAIN, J.]\nlevelled some allegations against the local police. This extra-\nordinary power must be exercised sparingly, cautiously and in\nexceptional situations where it becomes necessary to provide\ncredibility and instil confidence in investigations or where the\nincident may have national and international ramifications or\nwhere such an order may be necessary for doing complete\njustice and enforcing the fundamental rights. Otherwise the CBI\nwould be flooded with a large number of cases and with limited\nresources, may find it difficult to properly investigate even\nserious cases and in the process lose its credibility and\npurpose with unsatisfactory investigations.\n47. In Secretary, Minor Irrigation \u0026 Rural Engineering\nServices, U.P. \u0026 Ors. vs. Sahngoo Ram Arya \u0026 Anr., 31 this\nCourt had said that an order directing an enquiry by the CBI\nshould be passed only when the High Court, after considering\nthe material on record, comes to a conclusion that such material\ndoes disclose a prima facie case calling for an investigation\nby the CBI or any other similar agency. We respectfully concur\nwith these observations.\nA\nB\nC,\nD\n48. All the cases shall now be placed before the respective E\nBenches for disposal in terms of this opinion.\nR.P.\n31. (2002) 5 SCC 521.\nQuestion answered.\n.\n"}
