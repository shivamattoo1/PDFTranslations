Candidate registered upto 1970 were considered. In 1979\nthe list of selected candidates was sent to the employer. Respondent was\nregistered with the employment exchange in 1976. It is alleged that the\nrespondent in connivance with the Assistant in the exchange got his name\nenlisted in the list of the candidates registered upto 1970 and was selected.\nAppellant came to know about the same and offer of appointment was not issued.\nRespondent filed an application. Tribunal directed for conduct of enquiry.\nG During pendency, respondent filed writ petition. Interim order was passed to\nconsider the case of the respondent for appointment and the respondent was\nissued offer of appointment. However, High Court dismissed the writ petition\nas it was not maintainable. Thereafter, Employment Officer sent a report to\nthe appellant holding the respondent guilty of misconduct. Respondent filed\nH\n1068\nDIVISIONAL FORESTS OFFICER v. M. RAMALINGA REDDY\n1069\noriginal application challenging the order of the Employment Officer and A\ndirections to allow him all service benefits as Forester from the date of\nselection. During pendency, appellant issued show cause notice to the\nrespondent as to why his name should not be removed from the post. Tribunał\ndismissed the application and directed the respondent to submit explanation\nto the show cause notice. Aggrieved respondent filed writ petition which was\nallowed and the respondent was directed to be continued in service. Hence the\npresent appeal.\nAllowing the appeal, the Court\nB\nC\nHELD: 1.1. The Employment Exchange sought to withdraw the\nsponsorship of the respondent since a Junior Assistant in the Exchange had\nconnived with the respondent in the matter of sponsoring of his name in 1979\nalthough he was not entitled therefore. In absence of his name having been\nlegally sponsored, the candidature of the respondent could not have been\nconsidered for appointment as a Forester. Such a view appears to have been\ntaken by the Employment Officer. It sent a report in that behalf. Appellant D\nNo. 1 intended to give effect to the aid report. For the said purpose, it had\nissued a show cause notice. [Paras 7 and 8] [1072-G-H; 1073-A-B]\n1.2. A selected candidate has no legal right to be appointed automatically.\nRespondent claims his right to continue in service only because he was\nselected. [Para 10] [1073-C]\n1.3. High Court in passing the impugned judgment, with respect, did\nnot pose unto itself a right question. Pursuant to or in furtherance of the\nsaid show cause notice, respondent was required to show cause as to why his\nservices should not be terminated. Therefore, the observations of the High\nCourt, to the effect that he having been appointed on 23.4.1982 on the minimum\nscale of pay, cannot be permitted to continue to draw the same scale of pay as\napplicable in 1978 without any revisional increments was wholly irrelevant.\n[Para 11] [1073-D-E]\n1.4. It is not a case where the notice was issued wholly without\njurisdiction. It is also not a case where the said notice was otherwise illegal.\nIt is also not a case where an order has been passed without application of\nmind. It is also not a case where the appellant had made up its mind and the\nnotice had been issued only by way of a formality. The Tribunal directed the\nrespondent to show his cause. Ordinarily, no writ petition would be\nmaintainable at that stage. [Paras 9 and 12] [1073-C, F]\nE\nF\nG\nH\nT\nA\n1070\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 4 S.C.R.\nM/s. Siemens Ltd. v.

He was appointed\npursuant to an interim order by the High Court. High Court ordinarily should\nB not have done so. In any event, the writ petition having been dismissed, the\nC\ninterim order also came to an end. It could not have been directed to be\ncontinued. Thus, respondent did not have any legal right to continue in service\nafter dismissal of the writ petition by the High Court. Furthermore it is\ndoubtful as to whether an original application could have been filed questioning\nthe report of the District Employment Officer.\n[Paras 17 and 19] [1075-G; 1076-F-G]\nManagement of Express Newspapers (Private) Ltd., Madras v.

Kameshwaran, for the Respondent.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by:\nG\n\"\nS.B. SINHA, J. 1. Leave granted.\n2. Five vacancies of Foresters were notified on or about 22.11.1978 to\nthe District Employment Exchange, Nellore. Pursuant thereto names were\nsponsored and 49 candidates registered upto 6.09.1969 were considered for\nH pre-submission interview. However, a request was made to the District\n✓\nDIVISIONAL FORESTS OFFICER v. M. RAMALINGA REDDY [S.B. SINHA, J.] 1071\nEmployment Exchange, Nellore on 22.12.1978 to sponsor names of some more A\ncandidates for the above posts. 60 candidates registered upto 11.02.1970\nwere initially considered and after submission interview a list of 18 candidates\nwas sent to the employer on 9.01.1979. In the said list, the name of the\nrespondent was also included although he got himself registered with the\nEmployment Exchange only in the year 1976 having registration No. 2412/76.\nHowever, against his name, the registration number was stated to be 6899/\n69. Allegedly, he got his name enlisted in the list of candidates in connivance\nwith one Mr. Harnadha Reddy, the then Junior Assistant of District Employment\nExchange, Nellore.\n3. Respondent was selected having been placed in Sl. No. 3 in the merit\nlist. Alleged fraud played by the respondent together with the aforementioned\nJunior Assistant, District Employment Exchange was brought to the notice\nof Appellant No. 1 on 24.04.1979. As a proposal was made thereby to delete\nhis name from the list of candidates sponsored by the District Employment\nExchange on 9.01.1979 for the post of Foresters, no offer of appointment was\nissued in his favour.\nB\nC\nD\nE\n4. Respondent, thereafter, filed an original application before the Andhra\nPradesh Administrative Tribunal. By an order dated 1.04.1981, a direction was\nmade to conduct an enquiry on the said application. During pendency of the\nsaid original application itself, he filed a writ petition wherein an interim order\nwas passed to consider his case for appointment. On or about 23.04.1982\npursuant to or in furthermore of the said interim order, an offer of appointment\nwas issued to the respondent. The said writ petition, however, was dismissed\nby the High Court in terms of an order dated 24.12.1992 opining that it had\nno jurisdiction in that behalf. The District Employment Officer, Nellore sent\na report to Appellant No. 1 holding the respondent guilty of misconduct. He F\nthereafter filed an original application before the Andhra Pradesh\nAdministrative Tribunal which was marked as O.A. No. 5409 of 1994 inter alia\nquestioning the order passed by the District Employment Officer contained\nin letter dated 24.08.1993 as arbitrary and illegal and directing Appellant No.\n1 to allow all service benefits to him as a Forester with effect from the date\nof his selection. Indisputably, during pendency of O.A. No. 5409 of 1994, a\nG\nnotice to show cause was issued as a why his name should not be removed\nfrom the post of Forester. The Tribunal, in terms of its order dated 5.05.1999,\ndismissed the said original application directing the respondent herein to\nsubmit his explanation to the said show cause notice. Aggrieved by and\ndissatisfied therewith, he filed a writ petition before the Andhra Pradesh High H\n1072\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 4 S.C.R.\nA Court and by reason of the impugned judgment dated 25.4.2005, the said writ\npetition has been allowed directing:\nB\nC\n“9. Accordingly, we set aside the order of the Tribunal and also the\nreport of the 3rd respondent - District Employment Officer, Nellore\ndated 24.8.1993 and consequently the show cause notice termination.\nPetitioner shall be continued in service, as if he has been in regular\nappointment from 23.4.1982 and he shall be given benefit of pay as\nrevised from time to time and he shall also be given notional increments\nup to the date of filing the present writ petition i.e. 19.7.1999 and\nthereafter fiscal monetary benefits shall be released.\n10. The arrears arising out of the pay fixation shall be paid within a\nperiod of three months from the date of receipt of a copy of this\norder.\"\n5. Mr. H. S. Gururaja Rao, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf\nof the appellants, would submit that the High Court committed a manifest\nD.\nerror in passing the impugned judgment insofar as it failed to take into\nconsideration that ordinarily an original application was not maintainable\nagainst a show cause notice.\n6. Mr. L. Nageswara Rao, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of\nthe respondent, however, would submit that as the respondent had been\nE\nappointed pursuant to an order passed by the High Court as far back as in\n1982, this Court should not interfere with the impugned judgment.\n7. The Parliament enacted the Employment Exchanges (Compulsory\nNotification of Vacancies) Act, 1959 to ensure equal opportunity for the\nF unemployed people. Although there exists some controversy as to whether\nnotification of services to an Employment Exchange is imperative in character\nor not, indisputably herein a requisition was made to the Employment Exchange.\nNames were sponsored by it keeping in view the seniority of the candidates\nwith reference to their registration in the Employment Exchange. Respondent\nis said to have been registered only in the year 1976. His name, therefore,\nordinarily could not have been sponsored by the Employment Exchange at\nthe relevant point of time. Allegedly, a Junior Assistant in District Employment\nExchange, Nellore had connived with the respondent in the matter of sponsoring\nof his name in the year 1979 although he was not entitled therefore. The\nEmployment Exchange, therefore, sought to withdraw the sponsorship of the\nH respondent. In absence of his name having been legally sponsored, the\nG\nبهم\nDIVISIONAL FORESTS OFFICER v. M. RAMALINGA REDDY [S.B. SINHA, J.]\n1073\ncandidature of the respondent could not have been considered for appointment A\nas a Forester. At least such a view appears to have been taken by the District\nEmployment Officer, Nellore. It, as noticed hereinbefore, sent a report in that\nbehalf.\n8. Appellant No. 1 herein intended to give effect to the said report. For\nthe said purpose, it had issued a show cause notice.\nB\n9. Whether despite the purported report of the District Employment\nOfficer, Nellore, the name of the respondent should be struck off from the rolls\nor not in a matter which would fall for consideration before the appropriate\nauthority. It is not a case where the notice was issued wholly without\njurisdiction. It is also not a case where the said notice was otherwise illegal.\n10. Respondent claims his right to continue in service only because he\nwas selected. A selected candidate, it is now well settled, has no legal right\nto be appointed automatically.\nC\nD\n11. The High Court in passing the impugned judgment, with respect, did\nnot pose unto itself a right question. Pursuant to or in furtherance of the said\nshow cause notice, the respondent was required to show cause as to why his\nservices should not be terminated. The observations of the High Court,\ntherefore, to the effect that he having been appointed on 23.4.1982 on the\nminimum scale of pay, cannot be permitted to continue to draw the same scale E\nof pay as applicable in 1978 without any revisional increments, was wholly\nirrelevant.\n12. It is also not a case where an order has been passed without\napplication of mind. It is also not a case where the appellant had made up\nits mind and the notice had been issued only by way of a formality. [See F\nM/s. Siemens Ltd. v. State of Maharashtra, (2006) 13 SCALE 297 The Tribunal,\nas noticed hereinbefore, directed the respondent to show his cause. Ordinarily,\nno writ petition would be maintainable at that stage.\n13. In Management of Express Newspapers (Private) Ltd., Madras v.\nG\nThe Workers and Ors., AIR (1963) SC 569, it was opined:\n\"15. The High Court undoubtedly has jurisdiction to ask the Industrial\nTribunal to stay its hands and to embark upon the preliminary enquiry\nitself. The jurisdiction of the High Court to adopt this course cannot\nbe, and is indeed not disputed. But would it be proper for the High H\n1074\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 4 S.C.R.\nCourt to adopt such a course unless the ends of Justice seem to make\nis necessary to do so? Normally, the questions of fact, though they\nmay be jurisdictional facts the decision of which depends upon the\nappreciation of evidence, should be left to be tied by the Special\nTribunals constituted for that purpose. If and after the Special Tribunals\ntry the preliminary issue in respect of such jurisdictional facts, it\nwould be, open to the aggrieved party to take that matter before the\nHigh Court by a writ petition and ask for an appropriate writ. Speaking\ngenerally, it would not be proper or appropriate that the initial\njurisdiction of the Special Tribunal to deal with these jurisdictional\nfacts should be circumvented and the decision of such a preliminary\nissue brought before a High Court in its writ jurisdiction.\nWe wish to point out that in making these observations, we do not\npropose to lay down any fixed or inflexible Rule; whether or not even\nthe preliminary facts should be tried by a High Court in a writ petition,\nmust naturally depend upon the circumstances of each case and upon\nthe nature of the preliminary issue raised between the parties. Having\nregard to the circumstances of the present dispute, we think the court\nof appeal was right in taking the view that the preliminary issue\nshould more appropriately be dealt with by the Tribunal. The appeal\ncourt has made it clear that any party who feels aggrieved by the\nfinding of the Tribunal on this preliminary issue may move the high\nCourt in accordance with law. Therefore, we are not prepared to accept\nMr. Sastris argument that the Appeal court was wrong in reversing the\nconclusion of the trial Judge insofar as the trial Judge proceeded to\ndeal with the question as to whether the action of the appellant was\na closure or a lockout.\"\n14. In State of Uttar Pradesh v. Brahm Datt Sharma and Anr., AIR\n(1987) SC 943 [1987] 2 SCC 179, this Court held:\n\"9. The High Court was not justified in quashing the show cause\nnotice. When a show cause notice is issued to a government servant\nunder a statutory provision calling upon him to show cause, ordinarily\nthe government servant must place his case before the authority\nconcerned by showing cause and the courts should be reluctant to\ninterfere with the notice at that stage unless the notice is shown to\nhave been issued probably without any authority of law. The purpose\nof issuing show cause notice is to afford opportunity of hearing to\nthe government servant and once cause is shown it is open to the\n✓\nDIVISIONAL FORESTS OFFICER v. M. RAMALINGA REDDY [S.B. SINHA, J.] 1075\nGovernment to consider the matter in the light of the facts and A\nsubmissions placed by the government servant and only thereafter a\nfinal decision in the matter could be taken. Interference by the court\nbefore that stage would be premature, the High Court in our opinion\nought not have interfered with the show cause notice.\"\n15. This Court in Special Director and Anr. v. Mohd. Ghulam Ghouse B\nand Anr., [2004] 3 SCC 440 stated the law, thus:\nC\n\"5. This Court in a large number of cases has deprecated the practice\nof the High Courts entertaining writ petitions questioning legality of\nthe show-cause notices stalling enquiries as proposed and retarding\ninvestigative process to find actual facts with the participation and in\nthe presence of the parties. Unless the High Court is satisfied that the\nshow-cause notice was totally non est in the eye of the law for\nabsolute want of jurisdiction of the authority to even investigate into\nfacts, writ petitions should not been entertained for the mere asking\nand a matter of route, and the writ petitioner should invariably be D\ndirected to respond to the show-cause notice and take all stands\nhighlighted in the writ petition. Whether the show-cause notice was\nfounded on any legal premises, is a jurisdictional issue which can\neven by urged by the recipient of the notice and such issues also can\nbe adjudicated by the authority issuing the very notice initially, before\nthe aggrieved could approach the court. Further, when the court E\npasses an interim order it should be careful to see that the statutory\nfunctionaries specially and specifically constituted for the purpose\nand are denuded of powers and authority to initially decide the matter\nand ensure that ultimate relief which may or may not be finally granted\nin the writ petition is not accorded to the writ petitioner even at the\nthreshold by the interim protection granted.\"\n16. This aspect of the matter has recently been considered by this Court\nin Union of India and Anr. v. Kunisetty Satyanarayana, (2006) 12 SCALE 262.\n17. Two other aspects of the matter cannot also be lost sight of.\nRespondent was not appointed pursuant to selection made in his favour. No\noffer of appointment was issued by the appellant. He was appointed pursuant\nto an interim order passed by High Court. The High Court ordinarily should\nnot have done so.\nF\nG\n18. In Metro Marins and Anr. v. Bonus Watch Co. (P) Ltd. and Ors., H\n1076\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 4 S.C.R.\n✗\nA [2004] 7 SCC 478, this Court held:\nB\nC\nD.\n(1)\nE\nF\nG\n\"9. Having considered the arguments of the learned counsel for the\nparties and having perused the documents produced, we are satisfied\nthat he impugned order of the appellate court cannot be sustained\neither on facts or in law. As noticed by this Court, in the case of\nDorab Cawasji Warden v. Coomi Sorab Warden, it has held that an\ninterim mandatory injunction can be granted only in exceptional cases\ncoming within the exceptions noticed in the said judgment. In our\nopinion, the case of the respondent herein does not come any one of\nthose exceptions and even on facts it is not such a case which calls\nfor the issuance of an interim mandatory injunction directing the\npossession being handed over to the respondent. As observed by the\nlearned Single Judge the issue whether the plaintiff is entitled to\npossession is yet to be decided in the trial court and granting of any\ninterim order directing handing over of possession would only mean\ndecreeing the suit even before trial. Once the possession of the\nappellant either directly or through his agent (caretaker) is admitted\nthen the fact that the appellant is not using the said property for\ncommercial purpose or not using the same for any beneficial purpose\nor the appellant has to pay huge amount by way of damages in the\nevent of he losing the case or the fact that the litigation between the\nparties is a luxury litigation are all facts which are irrelevant for\nchanging the status quo in regard to possession during the pendency\nof the suit.\"\n[See also Srikrishna and Ors. v. Aniruddha Singh and Ors., [2005] 12\nSCC 389].\n19. In any event, the writ petition having been dismissed, the interim\norder also came to an end. It could have been directed to be continued.\nRespondent did not, thus, have any legal right to continue in service after\ndismissal of the writ petition by the High Court.\n20. It is furthermore doubtful as to whether an original application could\nhave been filed questioning the report of the District Employment Officer.\n21. For the reasons aforementioned, the impugned judgment cannot be\nsustained which is set aside accordingly. Respondent may file his show cause\nwithin two weeks from date whereupon the appellants may take an appropriate\ndecision in accordance with law. The Appeal is allowed. However, in facts and\ncircumstances of the case, there shall be no order as to costs.\nH N.J.\nAppeal allowed.\n"}
