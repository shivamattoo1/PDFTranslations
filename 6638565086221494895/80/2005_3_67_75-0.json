KAPADIA, JJ.]\nTransplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994:\nA\nB\nC\nSection 9(3)—Issuance of No-Objection Certificate for transplantation\nof human organ into the body of recipient not being near relative-Competent\nauthority-Held: Authorisation Committee of the State to which donor and\nrecipient belong to is the competent authority to issue the No-Objection\nCertificate, since it is in a better position to ascertain that the removal of\norgan is not for commercial consideration but is out of affection or attachment\ntowards the recipient-Directions issued to the Authorisation Committees of D\nvarious States to frame rules requiring the donor and the recipient to give\ndetails of their financial positions and vocations.\nObject and purpose of the Act-Discussed.\nQuestion arising for consideration in the present Writ Petition is E\nwhether in case of transplantation of human organ into a body of recipient\nnot being a near relative, the Competent Authority to issue the ‘No-\nObjection' Certificate is the Authorisation Committee of the State to which\nthe donor and recipient of the organ belong to or the Authorisation\nCommittee of the State in which transplantation has to take place.\nDisposing of the writ petition, the Court\nHELD: 1. The Authorisation Committee of the State to which donor\nand the recipient belong is the Competent Authority to issue the 'No-\nObjection' Certificate. [74-D[\n2.1. The Transplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994 was\npromulgated to provide for the regulation of removal, storage and\ntransplantation of human organs for therapeutic purposes and for the\nprevention of commercial dealings in human organs and or matters\n67\nF\nG\nH\n68\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2005] 3 S.C.R.\nA connected therewith or incidental thereto. In case the donor is not a ‘near\nrelative', the requirement is that he must establish that removal of the\norgan was being authorized for transplantation into the body of the\nrecipient because of affection or attachment or for any special reasons to\nmake donation of his organ. [70-C, 73-E]\nB\n2.2. The Authorisation Committees of the State to which the donor\nand the donee belong have to take the exercise to find out whether\napproval is to be accorded. Such Committee shall be in a better position\nto ascertain the true intent and the purpose for the authorization to remove\nthe organ and whether any commercial element is involved or not. The\nC burden is on the applicants to establish the real intent by placing relevant\nmaterials for consideration of the Authorisation Committee. Whether there\nexists any affection or attachment or special reason is within the special\nknowledge of the applicants, and a heavy burden lies on them to establish\nit. It is always open to the Authorisation Committee considering the\napplication to seek information/materials from Authorization Committees*\nof other States/State Governments as the case may be for effective decision\nin the matter. In case any State is not covered by the operation of the Act\nor the Rules, the operative executive instructions/Government orders will\nhold the field. As the object is to find out their true intent behind the\ndonor's willingness to donate the organ, it would not be in line with the\nE legislative intent to require the Authorisation Committee of the State where\nthe recipient is undergoing medical treatment to decide the issue whether\napproval is to be accorded. [73-G-H; 74-A-D]\nD\n3. Since the object of the Statute is to rule out commercial dealings,\nit would be desirable to require the donor and recipient to give details of\nF their financial positions and vocations. It would be appropriate for the\nG\nH\nLegislature to accordingly amend the Rules. Until Legislative steps are\ntaken, all Authorisation committees shall, in terms of this judgment require\nthe applicants to furnish their income particulars for the previous three\nfinancial years and the vocations. [74-F-H]\n2005.\nCIVIL ORIGINAL JURISDICTION: Writ Petition (C) No. 156 of\n(Under Article 32 of the Constitution of India.)\nRajiv Kataria, Ms. Debjani Dass. Purkayastha and Ajay Thakur for the\nPetitioner.\nI\nF-\n1\nĮ\nKULDEEP SINGH v. STATE OF TAMIL NADU [PASAYAT, J.]\n69\nSubramoniun Prasad for State of Tamil Nadu.\nAtul Nanda, Addl. Advocate General for State of Punjab and Arun K.\nSinha for State of Punjab.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nARIJIT PASAYAT, J. In this petition under Article 32 of the\nconstitution of India, 1950 (in short the 'Constitution') some questions of\nseminal importance have been raised. Factual position as indicated by the\npetitioners needs to be noted in a nutshell as the issues are pristinely legal.\nA\nB\nPetitioner No. 1 is undergoing treatment at Devaki Hospital Ltd. at C\nChennai for renal disorder. The hospital in question is duly approved by the\nauthorities under the Transplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994 (in short\nthe 'Act') read with Transplantation of Human Organs Rules, 1995 (in short\nthe 'Rules') and is permitted to undertake Kidney transplantation. Doctors\ntreating petitioner No. 1 were of the view that both the kidneys of petitioner\nNo. 1 have failed to function. Petitioner No. 2 wanted to donate one kidney\nto petitioner No. 1 to save his life. The gesture was actuated by love and\naffection and there is no other consideration involved.\nD\nAn application was made under the Act before respondent No. 2 the\nDirector of Medical Education, Govt. of Tamil Nadu, Chennai for issuance E\nof 'No Objection Certificate' (in short the 'NOC'). The respondent No. 2 by\nletter dated 10.3.2005 indicated to the petitioners that the NOC is to be issued\nby the Authorisation Committee of the Punjab State (respondent No. 3) as the\nAuthorization Committee of the State of Tamil Nadu cannot issue such a\ncertificate. It was indicated that since both the petitioners belong to the State\nof Punjab, only the Authorisation Committee of the said State had competence F\nto issue to NOC. When request was made to respondent No. 3 through\nrespondent No. 4 i.e. the Director, Research and Medical Education, Punjab,\nit was indicated to the petitioners by said respondents that it is only the\nAuthorisation Committee of the State of Tamil Nadu which can issue the\ncertificate, as the transplantation was intended to be done in the said State.\nThe petitioners have made a grievance that because of the ticklish issue\nas to which State has the competence to issue the NOC, the life of petitioner\nNo. 1 is in peril.\nWe had issued notice to both the State Governments who are represented\nG\nH\nT\n70\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2005] 3 S.C.R.\nA by their learned counsel. The State of Tamil Nadu re-iterated its stand that\nonly the Authorisation. Committee of the State of Punjab was competent to\nissue the NOC as both petitioners belong to that State. The contrary stand is\ntaken by the State of Punjab on the ground that since the transplantation is\nto be done in the State of Tamil Nadu, only the Authorisation Committee of\nthe said State was competent to issue the NOC.\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nIn order to appreciate the rival submission, purpose for enactment of\nthe Act and a few provisions of the Act need to be noted.\nThe Act was promulgated to provide for the regulation of removal,\nstorage and transplantation of human organs for therapeutic purposes and for\nthe prevention of commercial dealings in human organs and for matters\nconnected therewith or incidental thereto.\nThe Act has come into force w.e.f. 4.2.1995 in certain States and in all\nUnion Territories. It is provided in Section 1 of the Act that it shall apply to\nsuch other States which adopt the Act by resolution passed in that behalf\nunder clause (1) of Article 252 of the Constitution. It is further submitted at\nthe Bar that executive instructions and/or government orders in line with the\nobject of the Act have been issued in such States. We need not go into that\nquestion in the present dispute as both the States of Tamil Nadu and Punjab\nare covered by the provisions of the Act and the Rules.\nSection 9 deals with \"Restriction on removal and transplantation of\nhuman organs”. The same reads as follows:\n\"Restrictions on removal and transplantation of human organs-\n(1) Save as otherwise provided in sub-section (3), no human organ\nremoved from the body of a donor before his death shall be\ntransplanted into a recipient unless the donor is a near relative of the\nrecipient.\n(2) Where any donor authorizes the removal of any of his human\norgans after his death under sub-section (2) or Section 3 or any person\ncompetent or empowered to give authority for the removal of any\nhuman organ from the body of any deceased person authorizes such\nremoval, the human organ may be removed and transplanted into the\nbody of any recipient who may be in need of such human organ.\n(3) If any donor authorizes the removal of any of his human\n+\n1\nKULDEEP SINGH v. STATE OF TAMIL NADU [PASAYAT. J.] 71\norgans before his death under sub-section (1) of Section 3 for A\ntransplantation into the body of such recipient not being a near relative\nas is specified by the donor by reason of affection or attachment\ntowards the recipient or for any other special reasons, such human\norgan shall not be removed and transplanted without the prior approval\nof the Authorisation Committee.\n(4) (a) The Central Government shall constitute, by notification,\none or more Authorisation Committees consisting of such members\nas may by nominated by the Central Government on such terms and\nconditions as may be specified in the notification for each of the\nUnion territories for the purposes of this section.\n(b) The State Government shall constitute, by notification, one or\nmore Authorisation Committees consisting of such members as may\nbe nominated by the State Government on such terms and conditions\nas may be specified in the notification for the purposes of this section.\nB\nC\nD\n(5) On an application jointly made in such form and in such\nmanner as may be prescribed, by the donor and the recipient, the\nAuthorisation Committee shall, after holding an inquiry and after\nsatisfying itself that the applicants have complied with all the\nrequirements of this Act and the rules made thereunder, grant to the\napplicants approval for the removal and transplantation of the human E\norgan.\n(6) If, after the inquiry and after giving an opportunity to the\napplicants of being heard, the Authorisation Committee is satisfied\nthat the applicants have not complied with the requirements of this\nAct and the rules made thereunder, it shall, for reasons to be recorded F\nin writing, reject the application for approval.\"\nG\nThe provision refers to donor who are not \"near relatives\" of the\nrecipient. The expression 'near relatives' is defined in Section 2(i) to mean\n‘spouse, son, daughter, father, mother, brother or sister'. Chapter II deals\nwith \"Authority for the removal of human organs\". Sub-section (2) of Section\n3 deals with removal of the organs after death for therapeutic purposes. Sub-\nsection (1) however deals with authorization by any donor for removal of any\nhuman organ before his death for therapeutic purposes. Sub-section (4) of\nSection 9 deals with constitution of Authorisation Committee consisting of\nsuch members as may be notified by the Central Government or the State H\n1.15\nB\n72\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2005] 3 S.C.R.\nA Government, as the case may be. Under Sub-Section (5) of Section 9\napplication is required to be jointly made by the donor and the recipient in\nthe prescribed manner. The Authorisation Committee is required to hold an\nenquiry and if after such an enquiry it is certified that the applicants have\ncomplied with the requirements of the Act and the Rules, it can grant the\napplicants approval for the removal and transplantation of the concerned\nhuman organs. If on the contrary, after enquiry and after giving an opportunity\nto the applicants of being heard, the Authorisation Committee is of the view\nthat the applicants have not complied with the requirements of the Act and\nthe Rules, the application for approval may be rejected for reasons to be\nrecorded in writing. Section 11 prohibits removal or transplantation of human\nC organs for any purpose other than therapeutic purposes. Chapter VI deals\nwith \"Offences and Penalties\". Section 18 provides for removal of human\norgan without authority. Section 19 provides for punishment for commercial\ndealings in human organs. The shocking exploitation of abject poverty of\nmany donors for even small sums of money, appears to have provided the\nfoundation for enacting the Act. The Authorisation Committee has to be\nsatisfied that the authorization for removal is not for commercial consideration.\nSince some amount of urgency has to be exhibited because of the need for\ntransplantation, expeditious disposal of the application would be appropriate.\nBut the matter should not be dealt with in a casual manner as otherwise the\nintent and purpose of the Act shall be frustrated.\nD\nE.\nF\nRule 3 deals with “Authority for Removal of Human Organ”. The\nconditions for removal before death are incorporated in the Form I. The same\nreads as follows :\n\"Authority for Removal of Human Organ - Any donor may\nauthorize the removal, before his death, of any human organ or his\nbody for therapeutic purposes in the manner and on such conditions\nas specified in Form 1.\"\nForm I reads as follows:\nG\n\"I,\n_aged\nresident of\nS/o, D/o, W/o, Mr.\nhereby authorize to remove for\ntherapeutic purposes/consent to donate my organ, namely,\nto :\nH\n(i) Mr./Mrs.\ns/o, d/o, w/o Mr.\naged\n1\nKULDEEP SINGH v. STATE OF TAMIL NADU [PASAYAT, J.] 73\nresident of\n_who happens to be my near relative as defined in A\nclause (i) of Section 2 of the Act.\n(ii) Mr./Mrs.\n_s/o, d/o, w/o Mr.\naged\nresident\nof\ntowards whom I possess special affection or attachment,\nor for any special reason (to be specified)\nI certify that the above authority/consent has been given by me\nout of my own free will without any undue pressure, inducement,\ninfluence or allurement and that the purposes of the above authority/\ndonation and of all possible complications, side - effects, consequences\nand options have been explained to me before giving this authority\nor consent or both.\nSignature of the Donor\"\nB\nC\nWhere the donor is not \"near relative\" as defined under the Act, the\nsituation is covered by Sub-Section (3) of Section 9. As the Form I in terms D\nof Rule 3 itself shows the same has to be filed in both the cases where the\ndonor is a near relative and where he is not, so far as the recipient is concerned.\nIn case the donor is not a near relative the requirement is that he must\nestablish that removal of the organ was being authorized for transplantation\ninto the body of the recipient because of affection or attachment or for any\nE\nspecial reasons to make donation of his organ. As the purpose of enactment\nof the Statute itself shows, there cannot be any commercial element involved\nin the donation. The object of the Statute is crystal clear that is intends to\nprevent commercial dealings in human organs. The Authorisation Committee\nis, therefore, required to satisfy that the real purpose of the donor authorizing\nremoval of the organ is by reason of affection or attachment towards the F\nrecipient or for any other special reason. Such special reasons can by no\nstretch of imagination encompass commercial elements. Above being the\nintent, the inevitable conclusion is that the Authorisation Committees of the\nState to which the donor and the donee belong have to take the exercise to\nfind out whether approval is to be accorded. Such Committee shall be in a\nbetter position to ascertain the true intent and the purpose for the authorisation\nto remove the organ and whether any commercial element is involved or not.\nThey would be in a better position to life the veil of projected affection or\nattachment and the so called special reasons and focus on the true intent. The\nburden is on the applicants to establish the real intent by placing relevant\nmaterials for consideration of the Authorisation Committee. Whether there H\nG\nF\nT,\nB\n74\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2005] 3 S.C.R.\nA exists any affection or attachment or special reason is within the special\nknowledge of the applicants, and a heavy burden lies on them to establish it.\nSeveral relevant factors like relationship if any (need not be near relationship\nfor which different considerations have been provided for), period of\nacquaintance, degree of association, reciprocity of feelings, gratitude and\nsimilar human factors and bonds can throw light on the issue. It is always\nopen to the Authorisation Committee considering the application to seek\ninformation/materials from Authorisation Committees of other States/State\nGovernments as the case may be for effective decision in the matter. In case\nany State is not covered by the operation of the Act or the Rules, the operative\nexecutive instructions/Government orders will hold the field. As the object is\nC to find out the true intent behind the donor's willingness to donate the organ,\nit would not be in line with the legislative intent to require the Authorisation\nCommittee of the State where the recipient is undergoing medical treatment\nto decide the issue whether approval is to be accorded. Form I in terms\nrequires the applicants to indicate the residential details. This indication is\nrequired to prima facie determine as to which is the appropriate Authorisation\nCommittee. In the instant case, therefore, it was the Authorisation Committee\nof the State of Punjab which is required to examine the claim of the petitioners.\nD\nE\nF\nWe may note here that there is a provision for appeal in terms of\nSection 17 of the Act in case of refusal by the Authorisation Committee. But\ntaking into account the urgency involved and the grey area projected by the\ntwo States regarding the proper Authorisation Committee, we have entertained\nthe Writ Petition and decided the issues involved. In the normal course, it\nwould be for the Appellate Authority constituted in terms of Section 17 who\nhas to consider the appeal to be preferred by the aggrieved party.\nSince the object of the Statute is to rule out commercial dealings, it\nwould be desirable to require the donor and recipient to give details of their\nfinancial positions and vocations. It would be appropriate for the Legislature\nto accordingly amend the Rules and the Form I, so that requirement for\ndisclosing incomes and vocations for some previous financial years (say 3\nyears) gets statutorily incorporated. This would help the Authorisation\nG Committees to assess whether any commercial dealing is involved or not,\nUntil Legislative steps are taken, all Authorisation Committees shall, in terms\nof this judgment require the applicants to furnish their income particulars for\nthe previous three financial years and the vocations. The petitioners are directed\nto furnish the aforesaid details within ten days from to-day before the\nH Authorisation Committee.\nKULDEEP SINGH v. STATE OF TAMIL NADU [PASAYAT, J.] 75\nWe find that in certain States administrative officials are nominated as A\nmembers of the Authorisation Committee. That appears to be the proper\ncourse as the Authorisation Committee has to decide both on the medical\nangle regarding need for transplantation, and the existence or otherwise of\nthe essential ingredients to be established under Sub-Section (3) of Section\n9 of the Act. Presence of an administrative official in the Authorisation\nCommittee would be helpful in deciding the issues more effectively.\nB\nThough we are told that the present Authorisation Committee of the\nState of Punjab consists of only doctors, in view of urgency we direct the\nexisting Committee to examine the matter without awaiting the induction of\nan administrative official. We request the Committee to examine the application C\nof the petitioners on the basis of materials to be placed by the petitioners and\nto decide whether the applicants have established the requirements necessary\nfor according approval. If it accords approval, the same may be tṛansmitted\nto the State of Tamil Nadu immediately so that the Authorisation Committee\nof the said State can also consider on the therapeutic angles. In case approval\nis not accorded, it shall be open to the applicants to avail such remedies as D\nare available in law. We make it clear that we have not expressed any opinion\non the issue as to whether approval is to be accorded or not as the same is\nto be considered by the Authorisation Committee.\nBefore parting with the case, we may indicate that with a view to\neffectuate the laudable object of the Act, it would be appropriate for States\nwhich have not yet adopted the Act, to do so immediately.\nCopies of our order be sent to the Ministry of Health and Law, Union\nof India and Chief Secretaries of all States and Union Territories for doing\nthe needful as indicated in our judgment.\nD.G.\nThe writ petition is disposed of accordingly. No costs.\nWrit Petition disposed of.\nE\nF\n"}
