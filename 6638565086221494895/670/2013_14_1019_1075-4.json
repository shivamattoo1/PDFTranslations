Plight of a\nvulnerable section of women in that relationship needs attention.\nMany a times, the women are taken advantage of and essential\ncontribution of women in a joint household through labour and\nemotional support have been lost sight of especially by the C\nwomen who fall in the categories mentioned in (a) and (d)\nsupra. Women, who fall under categories (b) and (c), stand on\na different footing, which we will deal with later. In the present\ncase, the appellant falls under category (b), referred to in\nparagraph 37(b) of the Judgment.\n40. We have, therefore, come across various permutations\nand combinations, in such relationships, and to test whether a\nparticular relationship would fall within the expression\n\"relationship in the nature of marriage”, certain guiding\nprinciples have to be evolved since the expression has not been\ndefined in the Act.\n41. Section 2(f) of the DV Act defines \"domestic\nrelationship\" to mean, inter alia, a relationship between two\npersons who live or have lived together at such point of time in\na shared household, through a relationship in the nature of\nmarriage. The expression \"relationship in the nature of\nmarriage\" is also described as defacto relationship, marriage\n- like relationship, cohabitation, couple relationship,\nmeretricious relationship (now known as committed intimate\nrelationship) etc.\n42.

A\nWales, Australia also provides for some guidelines with regard\nto the meaning and content of the expression \"de facto\nrelationship\", which reads as follows:\n\"4 De facto relationships\n(1) For the purposes of this Act, a de facto relationship is\na relationship between two adult persons:\n(a) who live together as a couple, and\n(b) who are not married to one another or related by\nfamily.\n(2) In determining whether two persons are in a de facto\nrelationship, all the circumstances of the relationship are\nto be taken into account, including such of the following\nmatters as may be relevant in a particular case:\n(a) the duration of the relationship,\n(b)\nthe nature and extent of common residence,\n(c) whether or not a sexual relationship exists,\n(d) the degree of financial dependence or\ninterdependence, and any arrangements for\nfinancial support, between the parties,\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\n(e) the ownership, use and acquisition of property,\n(f)\nthe degree of mutual commitment to a shared life,\n(g)\nthe care and support of children,\nG\n(h) the performance of household duties,\n(i)\nthe reputation and public aspects of the relationship.\n(3) No finding in respect of any of the matters mentioned\nH\n1064\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2013] 14 S.C.R.\nA\nB\nC\nin subsection (2) (a)-(i), or in respect of any combination\nof them, is to be regarded as necessary for the existence\nof a de facto relationship, and a court determining whether\nsuch a relationship exists is entitled to have regard to such\nmatters, and to attach such weight to any matter, as may\nseem appropriate to the court in the circumstances of the\ncase.\n(4) Except as provided by section 6, a reference in this\nAct to a party to a de facto relationship includes a\nreference to a person who, whether before or after the\ncommencement of this subsection, was a party to such a\nrelationship.\"\n47. \"In Re Marriage of Lindsay, 101 Wn.2d 299 (1984),\nLitham v. Hennessey 87 Wn.2d 550 (1976), Pennington 93\nD Wash.App. at 917, the Courts in United States took the view\nthat the relevant factors establishing a meretricious relationship\ninclude continuous cohabitation, duration of the relationship,\npurpose of the relationship, and the pooling of resources and\nservices for joint projects. The Courts also ruled that a\nE relationship need not be \"long term\" to be characterized as\nmeretricious relationship. While a long term relationship is not\na threshold requirement, duration is a significant factor. Further,\nthe Court also noticed that a short term relationship may be\ncharacterized as a meretricious, but a number of other important\nfactors must be present.\nF\nG\nH\n48. In Stack v. Dowden [2007] 2 AC 432, Baroness Hale\nof Richmond said:\n\"Cohabitation comes in many different shapes and sizes.\nPeople embarking on their first serious relationship more\ncommonly cohabit than marry. Many of these relationships\nmay be quite short-lived and childless. But most people\nthese days cohabit before marriage..... So many couples\nare cohabiting with a view to marriage at some later date\n- as long ago as 1998 the British Household Panel Survey\nINDRA SARMA v. V.K.V. SARMA\n[K.S. RADHAKRISHNAN, J.]\n1065\nA\nfound that 75% of current cohabitants expected to marry,\nalthough only a third had firm plans: John Ermisch,\nPersonal Relationships and Marriage Expectations (2000)\nWorking Papers of the Institute of Social and Economic\nResearch: Paper 2000-27. Cohabitation is much more\nlikely to end in separation than is marriage, and B\ncohabitations which end in separation tend to last for a\nshorter time than marriages which end in divorce. But\nincreasing numbers of couples cohabit for long periods\nwithout marrying and their reasons for doing so vary from\nconscious rejection of marriage as a legal institution to\nregarding themselves 'as good as married' anyway: Law\nCommission, Consultation Paper No 179, Part 2, para\n2.45.\"\n49. In MW v. The Department of Community Services\n[2008] HCA 12, Gleeson, CJ, made the following observations:\n\"Finn J was correct to stress the difference between living\ntogether and living together 'as a couple in a relationship\nin the nature of marriage or civil union'. The relationship\nbetween two people who live together, even though it is a\nsexual relationship, may, or may not, be a relationship in\nthe nature of marriage or civil union. One consequence of\nrelationships of the former kind becoming commonplace\nis that it may now be more difficult, rather than easier, to\ninfer that they have the nature of marriage or civil union, at\nleast where the care and upbringing of children are not\ninvolved.\"\n50. In Lynam v. The Director-General of Social Security\n(1983) 52 ALR 128, the Court considered whether a man and\na woman living together 'as husband and wife on a bona fide\ndomestic basis' and Fitzgerald, J. said:\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\n\"Each element of a relationship draws its colour and its\nsignificance from the other elements, some of which may\npoint in one direction and some in the other. What must H\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nLL\n1066\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2013] 14 S.C.R.\nbe looked at is the composite picture. Any attempt to\nisolate individual factors and to attribute to them relative\ndegrees of materiality or importance involves a denial of\ncommon experience and will almost inevitably be\nproductive of error. The endless scope for differences in\nhuman attitudes and activities means that there will be an\nalmost infinite variety of combinations of circumstances\nwhich may fall for consideration. In any particular case, it\nwill be a question of fact and degree, a jury question,\nwhether a relationship between two unrelated persons of\nthe opposite sex meets the statutory test.\"\n51. Tipping, J. in Thompson v. Department of Social\nWelfare (1994) 2 SZLR 369 (HC), listed few characteristics\nwhich are relevant to determine relationship in the nature of\nmarriage as follows:\n\"(1) Whether and how frequently the parties live in the\nsame house.\n(2) Whether the parties have a sexual relationship.\n(3) Whether the parties give each other emotional\nsupport and companionship.\n(4) Whether the parties socialize together or attend\nactivities together as a couple.\nF\n(5)\n(6)\n☐ G\n(7)\nWhether and to what extent the parties share the\nresponsibility for bringing up and supporting any\nrelevant children.\nWhether the parties share household and other\ndomestic tasks.\nWhether the parties share costs and other financial\nresponsibilities by the pooling of resources or\notherwise.\n☐ H\n(8)\nINDRA SARMA v.

Live-in relationship, as such, as already indicated, is\na relationship which has not been socially accepted in India,\nunlike many other countries. In Lata Singh v. State of U.P. [AIR C\n2006 SC 2522] it was observed that a live-in relationship\nbetween two consenting adults of heterosexual sex does not\namount to any offence even though it may be perceived as\nimmoral. However, in order to provide a remedy in Civil Law\nfor protection of women, from being victims of such relationship, D\nand to prevent the occurrence of domestic violence in the\nsociety, first time in India, the DV Act has been enacted to cover\nthe couple having relationship in the nature of marriage,\npersons related by consanguinity, marriages etc. We have few\nother legislations also where reliefs have been provided to E\nwoman placed in certain vulnerable situations.\nF\n53. Section 125 Cr.P.C., of course, provides for\nmaintenance of a destitute wife and Section 498A IPC is\nrelated to mental cruelty inflicted on women by her husband and\nin-laws. Section 304-B IPC deals with the cases relating to\ndowry death. The Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 was enacted to\ndeal with the cases of dowry demands by the husband and\nfamily members. The Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act,\n1956 provides for grant of maintenance to a legally wedded\nHindu wife, and also deals with rules for adoption. The Hindu G\nMarriage Act, 1955 refers to the provisions dealing with\nsolemnization of marriage also deals with the provisions for\ndivorce. For the first time, through, the DV Act, the Parliament\nhas recognized a \"relationship in the nature of marriage\" and\nnot a live-in relationship simplicitor.\nH\n1068\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2013] 14 S.C.R.\nA\n54. We have already stated, when we examine whether a\nrelationship will fall within the expression \"relationship in the\nnature of marriage\" within the meaning of Section 2(f) of the\nDV Act, we should have a close analysis of the entire\nrelationship, in other words, all facets of the interpersonal\nB relationship need to be taken into account. We cannot isolate\nindividual factors, because there may be endless scope for\ndifferences in human attitudes and activities and a variety of\ncombinations of circumstances which may fall for consideration.\nInvariably, it may be a question of fact and degree, whether a\nrelationship between two unrelated persons of the opposite sex\nmeets the tests judicially evolved.\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\n55. We may, on the basis of above discussion cull out\nsome guidelines for testing under what circumstances, a live-\nin relationship will fall within the expression \"relationship in the\nnature of marriage\" under Section 2(f) of the DV Act. The\nguidelines, of course, are not exhaustive, but will definitely give\nsome insight to such relationships.\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\nDuration of period of relationship\nSection 2(f) of the DV Act has used the expression\n\"at any point of time”, which means a reasonable\nperiod of time to maintain and continue a\nrelationship which may vary from case to case,\ndepending upon the fact situation.\nShared household\nThe expression has been defined under Section\n2(s) of the DV Act and, hence, need no further\nelaboration.\nPooling of Resources and Financial Arrangements\nSupporting each other, or any one of them,\nfinancially, sharing bank accounts, acquiring\nH\n"}
