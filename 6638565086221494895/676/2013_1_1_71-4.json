HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE R. A. 41\nMEHTA (RETD) \u0026 ORS. [DR. B.S. CHAUHAN, J.]\nunder Article 166 (3) of the Constitution. (Vide: Pu Myllai A\nHlychho \u0026 Ors. v. State of Mizoram \u0026 Ors., AIR 2005 SC\n1537).\nC\n22. In Ram Nagina Singh \u0026 Ors. v. S.V. Sohni \u0026 Ors.,\nAIR 1976 Pat 36, the Patna High Court considered the issue B\ninvolved herein, i.e., the appointment of the Lokayukta, under\nthe Bihar Lokayukta Act, 1974, and held that, ordinarily, when\na power is vested, even by virtue of a statute, in the Governor,\nhe must act in accordance with the aid and advice tendered\nto him by the Council of Ministers, for the simple reason that,\nhe does not cease to be an Executive Head, as mentioned\nunder the Constitution, merely because such authority is\nconferred upon him by a statute. It would, in fact, be violative\nof the scheme of the Constitution, if it was held that the mere\nuse of the word, \"Governor\" in any statute, is sufficient to impute\nto the legislature, an intention by it, to confer a power, \"eo\nnomine\". Any interpretation other than the one mentioned\nabove, would therefore, be against the concept of parliamentary\ndemocracy, which is one of the basic postulates of the\nConstitution.\nIn view of the Rules of Executive Business, the topic\ninvolving appointment of the Lokayukta, must be brought before\nthe Council of Ministers. Even if the appointment in question,\nis not governed by any specific rule in the Rules of Executive\nBusiness, such appointment must still be made following the\nsaid procedure, for the reason that the Rules of Executive\nBusiness cannot be such, so as to override any bar imposed\nby Article 163(3) of the Constitution.\nHowever, a different situation altogether may arise, where\nthe Governor ex-officio, becomes a statutory authority under\nsome statute.\nD\n・E\nF\nG\n23. In Hardwari Lal v. G.D. Tapase \u0026 Ors., AIR 1982 P \u0026\nH 439, the powers of the Governor, with respect to the\nappointment/removal of the Vice-Chancellor of Maharshi H\nC\n42\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2013] 1 S.C.R.\nA Dayanand University, Rohtak under the Maharshi Dayanand\nUniversity (Amendment) Act, 1980, were considered, wherein\na direction was sought with regard to the renewal of the term\nof the Vice-Chancellor of the said University. Certain promises\nhad been made in connection with the same, while making such\nB appointment. The Court held that, as the Governor was the ex-\nofficio Chancellor of the University, therefore, by virtue of his\noffice, he was not bound to act under the aid and advice of the\nCouncil of Ministers. Under Article 154 of the Constitution, the\nexecutive powers of the State are vested in the Governor, which\nmay be exercised by him either directly, or through officers\nsubordinate to him, in accordance with the provisions of the\nConstitution. Article 161 confers upon the Governor, a large\nnumber of powers including the grant of pardon, reprieves,\nrespites or remissions of punishment etc. Such. executive\npower can be exercised by him, only in accordance with the\naid and advice of the Council of Ministers. Article 162 states\nthat the executive power of the State, shall extend to all such\nmatters, with respect to which, the legislature of the State has\nthe power to make laws. Therefore, the said provision, widens\nthe powers of the Governor. Article 166(3) of the Constitution,\nfurther bestows upon the Governor the power to make rules for\nmore convenient transactions of business, of the Government\nof the State, and also for the purpose of allocating among the\nMinisters of State, such business.\nD\nE\nF\nThere are several ways by which, a power may be\nconferred upon the Governor, or qua the Governor, which will\nenable him to exercise the said power, by virtue of his office\nas Governor. Therefore, there can be no gainsaying that all the\npowers that are exercisable by the Governor, by virtue of his\nG office, can be exercised only in accordance with the aid and\nadvice of the Council of Ministers, except insofar as the\nConstitution expressly, or perhaps by necessary implication,\nprovides otherwise.\nH\nThus, in such a situation, the Statute makes a clear cut\nSTATE OF GUJARAT v. HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE R. A. 43\nMEHTA (RETD) \u0026 ORS. [DR. B.S. CHAUHAN, J.]\ndistinction between two distinct authorities, namely, the A\nChancellor and the State Government. When the legislature\nintentionally makes such a distinction, the same must also be\ninterpreted distinctly, and while dealing with the case of the\nVice-Chancellor, the Governor, being the Chancellor of the\nUniversity, acts only in his personal capacity, and therefore, the B\npowers and duties exercised and performed by him under a\nstatute related to the University, as its Chancellor, have\nabsolutely no relation to the exercise and performance of the\npowers and duties by him, while he holds office as the Governor\nof the State.\nC\nD\nヨ\n24. In Vice-Chancellor, University of Allahabad \u0026 Ors. v.\nDr. Anand Prakash Mishra \u0026 Ors., (1997) 10 SCC 264, this\nCourt dealt with the power of the Governor of the State of U.P.\nex-officio, with respect to all the Universities established under\nthe provisions of the U.P. State Universities Act, 1973\n(hereinafter referred to as 'the Act 1973). Section 68 of the Act,\n1973 empowers the Chancellor to entertain any question,\nrelated to the appointment, selection, promotion or termination\nof any employee in the University. In the meanwhile, the\nLegislature of the State of U.P., enacted the U.P. Public\nServices (Reservation of Schedule Castes, Tribes and\nBackward Classes) Act, 1994 (hereinafter referred to as 'the\nAct 1994), providing for a particular reservation. This Court held\nthat, Section 6 of the Act, 1994 enables the State Government\nto call for records and direct enforcement of the provisions of F\nthe said Act. This Court also held that, when the Governor ex-\nofficio, acts as the Chancellor of a University, he acts under\nSection 68 of the Act, 1973, and discharges statutory duties\nas mentioned under the Act, 1973, but when the Government\ncalls for the record of appointment of any employee, to examine G\nwhether the reservation policy envisaged under the Act, 1994,\nhas been given effect to or not, and takes action in such\nrespect, then he acts in his capacity as Governor, under Article\n163 of the Constitution of India and is therefore, bound to act\nupon the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers.\nH\nA\nC\nD\n44\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2013] 1 S.C.R.\n25. The Constitutional provisions hence, clearly provide\nthat the Governor does not exercise any power by virtue of his\noffice, in his individual discretion. The Governor is aided and\nadvised by the Council of Ministers in the exercise of such\npowers, that have been assigned to him, under Article 163 of\nB the Constitution. The executive power of the State, is\ncoextensive with the legislative power of the State, and the\nGovernor in the Constitutional sense, discharges the functions\nassigned to him under the Constitution, with the aid and advice\nof the Council of Ministers, except insofar as he is, by or under\nthe Constitution, required to exercise such functions in his own\ndiscretion. The satisfaction of the Governor for the purpose of\nexercise of his other powers or functions, as required by the\nConstitution, does not mean the personal satisfaction of the\nGovernor, but refers to satisfaction in the Constitutional sense,\nunder a Cabinet system of Government. The executive must\nact, subject to the control of the legislature. The executive\npower of the State, is vested in the Governor, as he is the head\nof the executive. Such executive power is generally described\nas residual power, which does not fall within the ambit of either\nlegislative or judicial power. However, executive power may\nalso partake legislative or judicial actions. All powers and\nfunctions of the President, except his legislative powers as\nhave been mentioned, for example, in Article 123, viz., the\nordinance making power, and all powers and functions of the\nGovernor, except his legislative power, as also for example,\nF under Article 213, which state that Ordinance making powers\nare executive powers of the Union, vested in the President under\nArticle 53(1) in one case, and are executive powers of the State\nvested in the Governor under Article 154(1) in the other case.\nClause (2) or clause (3) of Article 77 are not limited in their\nG operation, only with respect to the executive actions of the\nGovernment of India, under clause (1) of Article 77. Similarly,\nclause (2) or clause (3) of Article 166 are also not limited in\ntheir operation, only with respect to the executive actions of the\nGovernment of the State under clause (1) of Article 166. The\nH expression, 'Business of the Government of India' in clause (3)\nE\nSTATE OF GUJARAT v. HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE R. A. 45\nMEHTA (RETD) \u0026 ORS. [DR. B.S. CHAUHAN, J.]\nof Article 77, and the expression, 'Business of the Government A\nof the State' in clause (3) of Article 166, include all executive\nbusiness. (Vide: Samsher Singh (supra); Ramdas Shrinivas\nNayak (supra); Bhuri Nath \u0026 Ors. v. State of J \u0026 K \u0026 Ors., AIR\n1997 SC 1711; and Narmada Bachao Andolan v. State of\nMadhya Pradesh, AIR 2011 SC 3199).\nIn Maru Ram, Bhiwana Ram etc. etc. v. Union of India \u0026\nOrs. etc., AIR 1980 SC 2147, a Constitution Bench of this Court\nheld that, \"the Governor is but a shorthand expression for the\nState Government, and the President is an abbreviation for the\nCentral Government\".\nB\nC\n26. The exceptions carved out in the main clause of Article\n163(1), permit the legislature to entrust certain functions to the\nGovernor to be performed by him, either in his discretion, or in\nconsultation with other authorities, independent of the Council D\nof Ministers.\nThe meaning of the words 'by or under' is well-settled. The\nexpression, `by an Act', would mean by virtue of a provision\ndirectly enacted in the statute in question and that, which is\nconceivable from its express language or by necessary\nimplication therefrom. The words 'under the Act', would in such\ncontext, signify that which may not directly be found in the statute\nitself, but which is conferred by virtue of powers enabling such\naction(s), e.g., by way of laws framed by a subordinate law\nmaking authority competent to do so under the Parent Act.\n(Vide: Dr. Indramani Pyarelal Gupta \u0026 Ors. v. W.R. Natu \u0026\nOrs., AIR 1963 SC 274).\n27. This Court in Rameshwar Prasad (VI) v. Union of India,\n(2006) 2 SCC 1 held:\n57. The expression \"required\" found in Article 163(1) is\nstated to signify that the Governor can exercise his\ndiscretionary powers only if there is a compelling\nnecessity to do so. It has been reasoned that the\nE\nไป\nF\nG\nH\nA\nB\n46\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2013] 1 S.C.R.\nexpression \"by or under the Constitution\" means that the\nnecessity to exercise such powers may arise from any\nexpress provision of the Constitution or by necessary\nimplication. The Sarkaria Commission Report further\nadds that such necessity may arise even from rules and\norders made \"under\" the Constitution.\n28. However, there is a marked distinction between the\nprovisions of Articles 74 and 163 of the Constitution.\nThe provisions of Article 74 of the Constitution, are not pari\nC materia with the provisions of Article 163, as Article 74\nprovides that there shall be a Council of Ministers, with the\nPrime Minister at their head, to aid and advise the President,\nwho shall, in the exercise of his functions, act in accordance\nwith such advice as is rendered to him, provided that the\nD President may require the Council of Ministers to reconsider\nsuch advice, either generally or otherwise, and the President\nshall act in accordance with the advice that is tendered, after\nsuch reconsideration. While Article 163 provides that there shall\nbe a Council of Ministers with the Chief Minister at their head,\nE to aid and advise the Governor, in the exercise of his functions,\nan exception has been carved out with respect to\nsituations wherein, he is by, or under this Constitution,\nrequired to perform certain functions by exercising his\nown discretion.\nF\nG\nThe exception carved out by the main clause under Article\n163(1) of the Constitution, permits the legislature to bestow\nupon the Governor, the power to execute certain functions, that\nmay be performed by him, in his own discretion, or in\nconsultation with other authorities, independent of the Council\nof Ministers. While dealing with the powers of the Governor with\nrespect to appointment and removal, or imposing punishment\nfor misconduct etc., the Governor is required to act upon the\nrecommendations made by the High Court, and not upon the\naid and advice rendered by the Council of Ministers, for the\nH reason that, the State is not competent to render aid and\nSTATE OF GUJARAT v. HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE R. A. 47\nMEHTA (RETD) \u0026 ORS. [DR. B.S. CHAUHAN, J.]\nadvice to the Governor with respect to such subjects. While the A\nHigh Court retains powers of disciplinary control over the\nsubordinate judiciary, including the power to initiate disciplinary\nproceedings, suspend them during inquiries, and also to\nimpose punishments upon them, formal orders, in relation to\nquestions regarding the dismissal, removal, reduction in rank B\nor the termination of services of judicial officers on any count,\nmust be passed by the Governor upon recommendations made\nby the High Court. (Vide: Chandra Mohan v. State of U.P. \u0026\nOrs., AIR 1966 SC 1987; and Rajendra Singh Verma (dead)\nthr. Lrs. \u0026 Ors. v. Lt. Governor (NCT of Delhi) \u0026 Ors., (2011)\n10 SCC 1).\nC\nD\n29. In Bhuri Nath (supra), the question that arose was in\nrelation to whether the Governor was bound to act in\naccordance with the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers,\nor whether he could exercise his own discretion, independent\nof his status and position as the Governor, by virtue of him being\nthe ex-officio Chairman of the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine\nBoard, under the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Act, 1988.\nThe Shrine Board discharges functions and duties, as have\nbeen described under the Act, in the manner prescribed therein, E\nand thus, after examining the scheme of the Act, this Court held\nthat, “the decision is his own decision, on the basis of his own\npersonal satisfaction, and not upon the aid and advice of the\nCouncil of Ministers. The nature of exercise of his powers and\nfunctions under the Act is distinct, and different from the nature F\nof those that are exercised by him formally, in the name of the\nGovernor, under his seal, for which responsibility rests only with\nhis Council of Ministers, headed by the Chief Minister\".\n30. In State of U.P. \u0026 Ors. etc. v. Pradhan Sangh Kshettra\nSamiti \u0026 Ors. etc., AIR 1995 SC 1512, this Court dealt with\nthe position of the Governor in relation to functions of the State\nand held as under:\nG\n\"Admittedly, the function under Article 243(g) is to be\nexercised by the Governor on the aid and advice of his H\nA\nB\nC\nD\nヨ\nLL\nF\nG\nH\n48\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2013] 1 S.C.R.\nCouncil of Ministers. Under the Rules of Business, made\nby the Governor under Article 166(3) of the Constitution,\nit is in fact an act of the Minister concerned, or of the\nCouncil of Ministers, as the case may be. When the\nConstitution itself thus equates the Governor with\nthe State Government for the purposes of relevant\nfunctions,.......Further, Section 3(60)(c) of the General\nClauses Act, 1897, defines 'State Government” to mean\n\"Governor”, which definition is in conformity with the\nprovisions of the Constitution...The Governor means the\nGovernment of the State and all executive functions\nwhich are exercised by the Governor, except where he is\nrequired under the Constitution to exercise the functions\nin his discretion, are exercised by him on the aid and\nadvice of Council of Ministers.\" (Emphasis added)\n31. In S.R. Chaudhuri v. State of Punjab \u0026 Ors., AIR 2001\nSC 2707, this Court held as under:\n\"21. Parliamentary democracy generally envisages (/)\nrepresentation of the people, (ii) responsible government,\nand (iii) accountability of the Council of Ministers to the\nLegislature. The essence of this is to draw a direct line of\nauthority from the people through the Legislature to the\nexecutive.\nXX XX XX XX\n40. Chief Ministers or the Governors, as the case may be,\nmust forever remain conscious of their constitutional\nobligations and not sacrifice either political responsibility |\nor parliamentary conventions at the altar of \"political\nexpediency. .. Constitutional restraints must not be\nignored or bypassed if found inconvenient or bent to suit\n\"political expediency\". We should not allow erosion of\nprinciples of constitutionalism.\"\n32. The principle of check and balance is a well\nSTATE OF GUJARAT v. HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE R. A. 49\nMEHTA (RETD) \u0026 ORS. [DR. B.S. CHAUHAN, J.]\nestablished philosophy in the governance of our country, under A\nour Constitution. If we were all to have our way, each person\nwould be allowed to wage a war against every other person,\ni.e., Bellum Omnium Contra Omnes. This reminds us to abide\nby Constitutional law followed by statutory law, otherwise\neverybody would sit in appeal against the judgment of B\neverybody.\n33. In view of the aforesaid discussion, the law as evolved\nand applicable herein can be summarised to the effect that the\nGovernor is bound to act on the aid and advice of the Council\nof Ministers, unless he acts as, “persona designata\" i.e. \"eo\nnomine\", under a particular statute, or acts in his own discretion\nunder the exceptions carved out by the Constitution itself.\nBIAS:\n-\nC\n34. Absence of bias can be defined as the total absence\nof any pre-conceived notions in the mind of the Authority/Judge,\nand in the absence of such a situation, it is impossible to expect\na fair deal/trial and no one would therefore, see any point in\nholding/participating in one, as it would serve no purpose. The\nJudge/Authority must be able to think dispassionately, and sub-\nmerge any private feelings with respect to each aspect of the\ncase. The apprehension of bias must be reasonable, i.e., which\na reasonable person would be likely to entertain. Bias is one\nof the limbs of natural justice. The doctrine of bias emerges\nfrom the legal maxim - nemo debet esse judex in causa\npropria sua. It applies only when the interest attributed to an\nindividual is such, so as to tempt him to make a decision in\nfavour of, or to further, his own cause. There may not be a case\nof actual bias, or an apprehension to the effect that the matter\nmost certainly will not be decided, or dealt with impartially, but\nwhere the circumstances are such, so as to create a\nreasonable apprehension in the minds of others, that there is\na likelihood of bias affecting the decision, the same is sufficient\nto invoke the doctrine of bias.\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nA\nB\nC\n50\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2013] 1 S.C.R.\nIn the event that actual proof of prejudice is available, the\nsame will naturally make the case of a party much stronger, but\nthe availability of such proof is not a necessary pre-condition,\nfor what is relevant, is actually the reasonableness of the\napprehension in this regard, in the mind of such party. In case\nsuch apprehension exists, the trial/judgment/order etc. would\nstand vitiated, for want of impartiality, and such judgment/order\nbecomes a nullity. The trial becomes “coram non judice”.\nWhile deciding upon such an issue, the court must\nexamine the facts and circumstances of the case, and examine\nthe matter from the view point of the people at large. The\nquestion as regards, \"whether or not a real likelihood of bias\nexists, must be determined on the basis of probabilities that\nare inferred from the circumstances of the case, by the court\nobjectively, or, upon the basis of the impression that may\nreasonably be left upon the minds of those aggrieved, or the\npublic at large”. (Vide: S. Parthasarathi v. State of Andhra\nPradesh, AIR 1973 SC 2701; State of Punjab v. V.K. Khanna\n\u0026 Ors., AIR 2001 SC 343; N.K. Bajpai v. Union of India \u0026 Anr.,\n(2012) 4 SCC 653; and State of Punjab v. Davinder Pal Singh\nE Bhullar \u0026 Ors. etc., AIR 2012 SC 364).\nD\nF\nG\nH\nBINDING EFFECT OF THE JUDGMENT:\n35. There can be no dispute with respect to the settled\nlegal proposition that a judgment of this Court is binding,\nparticularly, when the same is that of a co-ordinate bench, or\nof a larger bench. It is also correct to state that, even if a\nparticular issue has not been agitated earlier, or a particular\nargument was advanced, but was not considered, the said\njudgment does not lose its binding effect, provided that the point\nwith reference to which an argument is subsequently advanced,\nhas actually been decided. The decision therefore, would not\nlose its authority, “merely because it was badly argued,\ninadequately considered or fallaciously reasoned\". The case\nmust be considered, taking note of the ratio decidendi of the\nsame i.e., the general reasons, or the general grounds upon\n"}
