[Paras 32, 33] [63-E-G; 65-\nB\nC\nD\nF\nC-D]\n4.4. Besides express restrictions in a statute or the\nConstitution, there can be implied restrictions in a statute\nand the Constitution and the statutory or the\nconstitutional authority cannot in breach of such implied\nrestrictions exercise its discretionary power. Moreover,\nArticle 226 of the Constitution vests in the High Court the\npower to issue to any person or authority, including in\nappropriate cases, any Government, within those\nterritories directions, orders or writs, including writs in the\nnature of habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo\nwarranto and certiorari, or any of them, for the\nenforcement of any of the rights conferred by Part ill and\nfor any other purpose. The power of the High Court\nunder Article 226 of the Constitution is, thus, not confined\nto only writ of quo warranto but to other directions,\norders or writs. [Para 34] [65-G-H; 66-A-C]\n4.5. The High Court should not normally, in exercise\nE of its power under Article 226 of the Constitution, interfere\nwith the discretion of the State Government in selecting\nand appointing the Chairman of the State Public Service\nCommission, but in an exceptional case if it is shown that\nrelevant factors implied from the very nature of the duties\nentrusted to Public Service Commissions under Article\n320 of the Constitution have not been considered by the\nState Government in selecting and appointing the\nChairman of the State Public Service Commission, the\nHigh Court can invoke its wide and extra-ordinary powers\nunder Article 226 of the Constitution and quash the\nselection and appointment to ensure that the discretion\nof the State Government is exercised within the bounds\nof the Constitution. [Para 34] [67-C-E]\nG\n5. In the present case, the High Court in its order\nH dated 13.07.2011 had held that the irregularities and\nSTATE OF PUNJAB v. SALIL SABHLOK AND ORS. 29\nD\nillegalities alleged against Shri Harish Dhanda have not A\nbeen substantiated. This Court had passed orders on\n01.08.2012 calling upon the State of Punjab to produce\nthe material referred to in para 69 of the judgment of the\nFull Bench of the High Court on the basis of which Shri\nHarish Dhanda was selected for appointment as B\nChairman of the Punjab Public Service Commission.\nPursuant to the order dated 01.08.2012, the State\nGovernment produced the files in which the selection and\nappointment of Shri Harish Dhanda was processed by\nthe State Government. The materials indicate that Shri C\nHarish Dhanda had B.A. and LL.B Degrees and was\npracticing as an Advocate at the District Courts in\nLudhiana and had been elected as the President of the\nDistrict Bar Association, Ludhiana for seven terms and\nhas been member of the Legislative Assembly. These\nmaterials do not indicate that Shri Harish Dhanda had any\nknowledge or experience whatsoever either in\n¨ administration or in recruitment nor do these materials\nindicate that. Shri Harish Dhanda had the qualities to\nperform the duties as the Chairman of the State Public\nService Commission under Article 320 of the Constitution.\nNo other information through affidavit has also been\nplaced on record to show that Shri Harish Dhanda has\nthe positive qualities to perform the duties of the office\nof the Chairman of the State Pubic Service Commission\nunder Article 320 of the Constitution. The decision of the\nState Government to appoint Shri Harish Dhanda as the\nChairman of the Punjab Public Service Commission was\nthus invalid for non-consideration of relevant factors\nimplied from the very nature of the duties entrusted to the\nPublic Service Commissions under Article 320 of the G\nConstitution. [Para 35] [67-F-H; 68-G-H; 69-A-D]\nE\nF\n6. In the result, the impugned order of the Division\nBench of the High Court dated 17.08.2011 quashing the\nselection and appointment of Shri Harish Dhanda as H\n30\n30\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2013] 5 S.C.R.\nA Chairman of the Punjab Public Service Commission, is\nnot interfered with, but the judgment dated 17.08.2011 of\nthe Full Bench of the High Court is set aside.

The appointment of the Chairperson of the\nPunjab Public Service Commission is an appointment to\na constitutional position and is not a \"service matter\". A\nPIL challenging such an appointment is, therefore,\nmaintainable both for the issuance of a writ of quo\nwarranto and for a writ of declaration, as the case may\nbe. [Para 107] [109-F-G]\n1.2. In a case for the issuance of a writ of declaration,\nG exercise of the power of judicial review is presently limited\nto examining the deliberative process for the\nappointment not meeting the constitutional, functional\nand institutional requirements of the institution whose\nintegrity and commitment needs to be maintained or the\nH\nSTATE OF PUNJAB v. SALIL SABHLOK AND ORS. 33\nappointment for these reasons not being in public A\ninterest. [Para 109-H; 110-A]\n1.3. The circumstances of this case leave no room for\ndoubt that the notification dated 7th July 2011 appointing\nMr. Harish Rai Dhanda was deservedly quashed by the\nHigh Court since there was no deliberative process\nworth the name in making the appointment and also\nsince the constitutional, functional and institutional\nrequirements of the Punjab Public Service Commission\nwere not met. [Para 109] [110-B-C]\nB\nC\n1.4. There is a need for a word of caution to the High\nCourts. There is a likelihood of comparable challenges\nbeing made by trigger-happy litigants to appointments\nmade to constitutional positions where no eligibility\ncriterion or procedure has been laid down. The High D\nCourts will do well to be extremely circumspect in even\nentertaining such petitions. It is necessary to keep in\nmind that sufficient elbow room must be given to the\nExecutive to make constitutional appointments as long\nas the constitutional, functional and institutional\nrequirements are met and the appointments are in\nconformity with the indicators given by this Court from\ntime to time. [Para 110] [110-C-E]\n1.5. Given the experience in the making of such\nappointments, there is no doubt that until the State\nLegislature enacts an appropriate law, the State of Punjab\nmust step in and take urgent steps to frame a\nmemorandum of procedure and administrative guidelines\nfor the selection and appointment of the Chairperson and\nmembers of the Punjab Public Service Commission, so\nthat the possibility of arbitrary appointments is eliminated.\n[Para 111] [110-F-G]\nE\nF\nG\nHari Bansh Lal v.
