LAKSHMANAN AND S.H. KAPADIA, JJ.]\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n-\nKarnataka Motor Vehicle Taxation (Amendment) Act, 1997–\nClassification of vehicles based on value for levy of life time tax'\nReasonableness of Held: As the State is competent to levy and collect tax\nunder Entry 57 List-II of the seventh schedule to the Constitution, levy based\non value cannot be struck down as unreasonable.\nAppellant had challenged the validity of Karnataka Motor Vehicle\nTaxation (Amendment) Act, 1997 on the ground that levy of 'life time tax’\non the value of the car exceeding 1500 CC is arbitrary, discriminatory\nand hit by Article 14 of the Constitution. Single Judge held that vehicle\ncosting Rs. 6 lacs and above constituted a different class by itself and\ntherefore, the levy cannot be said to be discriminatory. Division Bench\nupheld the same. Hence the present appeal.\nAppellant contended that the said Act has made an unreasonable\nclassification between the vehicles costing more than Rs. 6 lacs and vehicles\ncosting less than Rs. 6 lacs; that the motor vehicle taxes are compensatory\nin nature and can only be levied on the basis of the capacity of the engine,\nthe weight of the vehicle and the floor area, as such parameters have nexus\nwith the user and maintenance of the road; that by the introduction of\none more parameter namely, the “value” of the vehicle, the impugned levy\nhas ceased to be regulatory/compensatory in nature, and has no nexus with\nthe wear and tear of the public road and hence the impugned Act was\narbitrary, discriminatory and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution.\nDismissing the appeal, the Court\nHELD: The classification under Karnataka Motor Vehicle Taxation\n(Amendment) Act, 1997 is based on value of vehicles for the levy of life\ntime tax and indicates measure or a rate of tax applied differently on\ndifferent vehicles depending upon various circumstances. Since there is\n1128\nMOHAN DAS N. HEGDE (DEAD) THROUGH LRS. v. STATE [KAPADIA, J.] 1129\ncompetence to levy and collect the tax under Entry 57 List-II of the seventh A.\nschedule to the Constitution, the levy cannot be struck down only on the\nground that the incidence of the tax falls differently on different categories\nof the vehicles. The burden has to be distributed on different classes of\nvehicles or on different persons who owned the vehicles. It is not for the\nCourt to decide the impact of such tax on different persons. [1130-D-F]\nThe State of Tamil Nadu v. M. Krishnappan and Anr etc., Civil appeal\nNos. (1869)-(1880) of (2000) decided by supreme Court on March 18,\n(2005), relied on\nCIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 7398 of 2000.\nFrom the Judgment amd Order dated 23.2.2000 of the Karnataka High\nCourt in W.A .No. 7000 of 1999.\nMs. Kiran Suri and Himanshu Bhuttanand Mali Santosh, for the\nAppellant.\nB\nC\nD\nAnil Mishra, Sanjay R.Hegde and A. Rohan Singh, for the respondents.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nKAPADIA, J. This civil appeal by grant of special leave is filed by\nassessee against the judgment and order dated 23.2.2000 of the Karnataka E\nHigh Court in Writ Appeal No. 7000 of 1999 upholding the constitutional\nvalidity of Karnataka Motor Vehicle Taxation (Amendment) Act, 8 of 1997\n(hereinafter referred to as \"the said 1997 Act”).\nThe appellant was the owner of \"Opel Astra\" which was taxed on\nF\n“value basis” under the impugned 1997 Act. The said 1997 Act was\nchallenged on the ground that the levy of “life time tax” on the value of the\ncar exceeding 1500 CC was arbitrary, discriminatory and hit by article 14 of\nthe Constitution.\nBy order dated 29.6.1999, the learned Single Judge held that the vehicle\ncosting Rs. 6 lacs and above constituted a different class by itself and, therefore,\nlevy cannot be said to be discriminatory and violative of article 14 of the\nConstitution.\nG\nAggrieved by the said judgment, the appellant herein carried the matter\nin appeal to the Division Bench, which, while upholding the decision of the H\n1\n1130\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2005] 2 S.C.R.\nA learned Single Judge, dismissed the writ appeal. Hence, this civil appeal.\nMrs. Kiran Suri, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant\nsubmitted that the impugned 1997 Act, as amended, violated article 14\ninasmuch as the said Act has made an unreasonable classification between\nthe vehicles costing more than Rs. 6 lacs and vehicles costing less than Rs.\nB 6 lacs. Learned counsel further contended that the motor vehicle taxes are\ncompensatory in nature. Such taxes, according to the learned counsel, can\nonly be levied on the basis of the capacity of the engine, the weight of the\nvehicle and the floor area, as such parameters have nexus with the user and\nmaintenance of the road. Learned counsel submitted that by the introduction\nC of one more parameter, namely, the “value” of the vehicle, the impugned\nlevy has ceased to be regulatory/compensatory in nature, as such a parameter\nhas no nexus with the wear and tear of the public road. In the circumstances,\nit was urged that the impugned Act was arbitrary, discriminatory and violative\nof article 14 of the Constitution.\nD\nWe do not find any merit in the above arguments. The above\nclassification indicates a measure or a rate of tax applied differently on different\nvehicles depending upon various circumstances and so long as there is\ncompetence to levy and collect the tax under Entry 57 List-II of the seventh\nschedule to the Constitution, the levy cannot be struck down only on the\nground that the incidence of the tax falls differently on different categories\nof the vehicles. The burden has to be distributed on different classes of\nvehicles or on different persons who owned the vehicles. How equitable such\ntax could fall on different persons is not for the Court to decide. Lastly, this\nmatter is squarely covered by our judgment delivered today in the case of\nThe State of Tamil Nadu v. M. Krishnappan and Anr Etc., Civil Appeal Nos.\nF (1869)-(1880) of (2000).\nE\nFor the aforestated reasons, we do not find any infirmity in the impugned\njudgment of the High Court. Accordingly, the appeal fails and is dismissed,\nwith no orders as to costs.\nG D.G.\nAppeal dismissed.\n"}
