ARIJIT PASAYAT AND LOKESHWAR SINGH PANTA, JJ.] B\nLand Reforms:\nKarnataka Land Reforms Act, 1961-S.2(18)—'Punja' land-Land not\nfit for cultivation-Only grass growing on it naturally-Hence, prayer to C\ndeclare same as agricultural land rightly rejected by High Court.\nThe land in question is 'Punja' land situated in the Dakshina Kannada\nDistrict. The land is not fit for cultivation. Only grass is growing on it\nnaturally. Prayer of Appellants for declaring such land as agricultural land\nwas rejected by the High Court. Hence the present appeals.\nDismissing the appeals, the Court\nᎠ\nHELD: A bare reading of s.2(18) of the Karnataka Land Reforms Act,\n1961 shows that land means agricultural land that is to say, land which is\nused or capable of being used for agricultural purposes or purposes E\nsubservient thereto and includes horticultural land, forest land, garden land,\npasture land, plantation and tope but does not include house-site or land used\nexclusively for non-agricultural purposes. Therefore, it has to be established\nthat the land was capable of being used for agricultural purposes or purposes\nsubservient thereto. The Tribunal and the High Court have categorically noted\nthe fact that the land being Punja land is not cultivable land and only grass is\ngrown naturally. If the appellants wanted to establish that it was being used\nfor agricultural purposes, evidence should have been led in that regard. The\nDivision Bench has categorically noted that no evidence in that regard was\nled. Mere reference to the spot inspection to show the existence of a few\ncoconut trees does not establish that the land was capable of being used for\nagricultural purpose. In view of the factual finding recorded by the Tribunal\nand the High Court there is no merit in the present appeals.\n[Paras 9 and 10] [932-E, F, HJ\nCIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION : Civil Appeal Nos. 4992-4993 of\n929\nF\nG\nH\n930\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 3 S.C.R.\nA\nB\nC\nD\n2007.\nFrom the Judgment and Order dated 22.02.1999 of the High Court of\nKarnataka at Bangalore in Writ Appeal Nos. 4088/1998 and 4463/1998.\nS.N.

Bhasme for the Respondents.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nDR. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. 1. Appellants call in question legality of the\njudgment rendered by a Division Bench of the Karnataka High Court dismissing\nthe writ appeal filed by the appellants.\n2. Background facts in a nutshell are as follows:\nThe appellants claim to be Chalgeni tenants and claim grant of\noccupancy rights under the Karnataka Land Reforms Act, 1961 (in short the\n'Act'). According to them late Sesu Poojary, the father of the appellants filed\nan application in Form No.7 before the Land Tribunal, Karkala (for short the\n'Tribunal'). The claim was in respect of Survey No. 162/1 measuring 2 acres\n11 cents and Survey No. 176/2 measuring 8 cents in Gandhinagar, Marpady\nE village Moodabedri, Karkala Taluk of Dakshina Kannada District.\n3. Respondent Harideesh Kumar claimed to be the owner of the land on\nthe basis of a gift-deed from his grandfather. Originally, the Tribunal granted\noccupancy rights to the appellants' father by an order dated 25.4.1981. The\nsaid order was challenged in Writ Petition No.10910/84 before the Karnataka\nF High Court and the High Court allowed the writ petition and remanded the\nmatter to the Tribunal. After remand by order dated 18.12.1996 rendered by\na majority Tribunal rejected the claim in respect of 1.81 acres of land and\ngranted 0.30 acres on humanitarian grounds. The appellants as well as the\nrespondent-Harideesh Kumar filed writ petitions challenging the order passed\nby the Tribunal. Learned Single Judge dismissed the writ petition filed by the\nappellants and allowed the writ petition filed by the respondent-Harideesh\nKumar by a common order. Appellants filed two writ appeals.\nG\nH\n4. Before the High Court the stand of the appellants was that Punja\nlands in the district are agricultural lands. According to the appellants, the\nSUBHAKAR v. HARIDEESH KUMAR [PASAYAT, J.]\n931\ndefinition of \"land\" in terms of Section 2(18) of the Act is wide enough to A\ninclude Punja land. Referring to some earlier decisions the Division Bench\nof the High Court came to hold that Punja land is not agricultural land and\nonly grass is naturally grown in such land. Though the High Court referred\nto classification of different Punja lands, it held that whether Punja land is\nagricultural land is a question of fact. Finding has been recorded that this\nB\nis not cultivable land and the grass is naturally grown on the land. Therefore,\nthe stand of the appellants was not correct. It was observed as follows:-\nC\n\"In view of the above circumstances, we hold that in this case,\nthe land in question is a Punja Land where only thatched grass is\ngrown naturally. There may be some trees on the land. That does\nnot mean that a natural grass growing land is an agricultural land\nparticularly, in the facts and circumstances of this case where a built\nhouse is surrounding the land. For all the above reasons, in the\npresent case, having regard to the facts of the case, we make it clear\nthat Punja land in Dakshina Kannada is not an agricultural land. We\nmake it clear that where Punja land is brought under cultivation, it is D\nnot a bar on the parties to adduce evidence that such land is brought\nunder cultivation for agricultural purpose. No such evidence is there\nin this case.\"\n5. Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the application\nunder Section 48A of the Act was in relation to two plots. As in Form 7 there E\nwas no mention of Survey 176/2. The appellants have no grievance with\nregard to the findings recorded. But the Tribunal has lost sight of the fact\nthat on spot inspection certain coconut trees were found on the land in\nquestion. Before the Tribunal, the Chairman allowed the claim while the other\nmembers rejected the same. Reference was made to the fact that the claimant F\nwas a government servant and his son had admitted that the lease was\nobtained from somebody else. It was also admitted that there was tailoring\nestablishment running on the land in question. However, on humanitarian\ngrounds the Tribunal allowed retention of the house and 30 cents of land.\nLearned Single Judge found that no agricultural activity was possible and the\nland admittedly was Punja Land. It was further observed that no agrarian G\nrelationship was established, and Punja land in the absence of any evidence,\ncannot be treated as agricultural land. That also was the finding by the\nDivision Bench which further noted that no evidence was brought to show\nthat the land was under cultivation.\n6. These are assailed by the learned counsel for the appellants.\nH\n932\nA\nB\nC\nD\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 3 S.C.R.\n7. In response, learned counsel for the respondent-Harideesh Kumar\nsubmitted that land had been obtained on lease for a period 11 months\nstarting from 1.1.1963 and 29.11.1963. The same also shows that the claimant's\nfather was a tenant and monthly rent of Rs.2.25 was payable by him. It was\nfurther submitted that the son of Subhakar accepted somebody else to be the\nlandlord. Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that she was aunt\nand was managing the affairs on behalf of the respondent. The said plea is\nwithout any basis. In fact, the rent receipt Ex.P5 on which the appellants\nplaced reliance did not indicate any serial number. It was also noted by the\nlearned Single Judge that there was no basis for allowing retention of the\nhouse and 30 cents and the same has been rightly set aside.\n8. Section 2(18) of the Act reads as follows:\n\"Land” means agricultural land, that is to say, land which is used or\ncapable of being used for agricultural purposes or purposes subservient\nthereto and includes horticultural land, forest land, garden land, pasture\nland, plantation and tope but does not include house-site or land used\nexclusively for non agricultural purposes.\n\"\n9. A bare reading of the provision shows that land means agricultural\nland that is to say, land which is used or capable of being used for agricultural\npurposes or purposes subservient thereto and includes horticultural land,\nE forest land, garden land, pasture land, plantation and tope but does not\ninclude house-site or land used exclusively for non- agricultural purposes.\nTherefore, it has to be established that the land was capable of being used\nfor agricultural purposes or purposes subservient thereto. The Tribunal and\nthe High Court have categorically noted the fact that the land being Punja\nland is not cultivable land and only grass is grown naturally. If the appellants\nwanted to establish that it was being used for agricultural purposes, evidence\nshould have been led in that regard. The Division Bench has categorically\nnoted that no evidence in that regard was led. Mere reference to the spot\ninspection to show the existence of a few coconut trees does not establish\nthat the land was capable of being used for agricultural purpose.\nF\nG\n10. In view of the factual finding recorded by the Tribunal and the High\nCourt (both learned Single Judge and the Division Bench) there is no merit\nin the present appeals which are accordingly dismissed. There will be no\norder as to costs.\nH B.B.B.\nAppeals Dismissed.\n"}
