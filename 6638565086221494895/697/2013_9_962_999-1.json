Accused No. 2 had indulged\nin financing for purchase of heroin for which he entered India\nwithout registering himself as a foreigner. The heroin, which\nwas seized, was being taken for the said export which was\nintercepted in the manner stated below:-\n\"As per the prosecution, after the information was received\nby Mr. L.S. Aruldoss, Intelligence Officer (P.W.9) on\n23.10.2004 and discussed with Mr. Gunabalan,\nSuperintendent (P.W.6) and Mr. A. Sendhil Murugan,\nIntelligence Officer (P.W.10) and further action was\nsanctioned, the raiding party consisting of PW.6, PW.7,\nPW.10 with Sepoy and driver, left the NCB office in the\nvehicle Mini Bus bearing Registration No. TN 09 C 3113\non 24.10.2004 at 9.00 a.m and had reached GNT Road\n100' Road Junction at 11.00 a.m. Two independent\nwitnesses namely, Mr. S.

The case argued by the\nprosecution was that the conspiracy hatched between\nAccused No. 1 to 4 was proved by the seizure of Ex.

Conspiracy could be\nproved only through the conduct of the accused. A-3 and\nA-4 had travelled with the contraband in the train and have\nmet A-1 and A-2 at Nellore and handed over the same and\nboarded in the ambassador car only due to the previous\nmeeting of minds by fixing the time and place of handing\nover the contraband to the concerned accused. From the\nproved conduct of A-1 to A-4 it is clear that they have\ninvolved themselves in the illegal trafficking of heroin. Ex.

Hence, the prosecution contended that the charges\nagainst A-1 to A-4 for possession transportation of heroin\nfor Export from India and Conspiracy U/s. 8(c) r/2. 21 (c)\nand 29 of NDPS Act were well proved.\"\n12. In so far as the charge under Section 28 of the NDPS\nAct is concerned, the trial court held that the said charge was\nnot proved against the accused persons, in as much as at the\nstage of preparation to commit the offence of illegal export of\ncontraband, the car was intercepted and search and seizure\nconducted which resulted in the recovery of the contraband. As\nsuch, the accused persons were apprehended in the middle\nof the operation and since the attempt to commit the offence\nof export had not yet begun, it could not be said that the\naccused persons had committed any act which could be\nconsidered as a step towards the commission of offence of\nexport of the contraband. The accused persons were, thus,\nacquitted of the charge under Section 28 of the NDPS Act.\n13. Likewise, the trial court held that charge under Section\n27A of the NDPS Act foisted upon the accused No. 2 was not\nE proved as no oral or documentary evidence was produced in\nthe form of Bank Pass Book or income particulars or documents\nregarding the money transactions between the seller and the\npurchaser of heroin. Moreover, there was no oral or\ndocumentary evidence to show that the Accused No. 2 had\nfailed to register himself as a foreigner or that he had entered\ninto India without valid and legal documents and thus, he was\nacquitted of the charge under Section 3(3) of the Passport\n(Entry into India) Act, 1920 read with Rule 3 (a) as well as under\nSection 14 of the Foreigners Act, 1946.\nF\nG\n14. While discussing the main charge leveled under\nSection 8(c) read with Section 21(c) and 29 of the NDPS Act,\nthe trial court noted that the defence counsel had sought for\ndiscard of the prosecution case on the following grounds:\nH (i)\nVoluntary statement recorded under Section 67 of\nTOFAN SINGH v. STATE OF TAMIL NADU\n[A.K.SIKRI, J.]\n975\nthe NDPS Act had been retracted and so, they had A\nno evidentiary value.\n(ii)\nThere was violation of Section 50 of the NDPS Act\nas there was non-compliance of the provisions\nthereof.\nB\n(iii)\nDriver of the vehicle was not examined which was\nfatal to the prosecution case.\n(iv) Sample sent for analysis and the seized contraband\nwere not one and the same.\nC\n(v)\nThere was no link evidence which vitiated the trial.\n3\n(vi)\nNames of Accused No. 3 (the appellant) and\nAccused No. 4 were not mentioned in the\ninformation which was received by the Intelligence D\nOfficer and, therefore, they were wrongly included\nin the charge sheet.\n(vii) There was a violation of standing order 1/88 in as\nmuch as samples were not submitted to the E\nChemical Examiner within 72 hours of seizure and\nthe report was not submitted within 15 days of\nreceipt of contraband for analysis.\n(viii) Statements under Section 67 were not recorded in\naccordance with law, as no statutory warning under\nSection 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was\ngiven to the accused persons before recording the\nstatement.\n15. The trial court discussed the arguments predicated on\nthe aforesaid defence but found the same to be meaningless.\nOn the basis of prosecution evidence, the trial court concluded\nthat the prosecution was able to prove the charges under\nSection 8(c) read with Section 21(c) and Section 29 of the\nNDPS Act and convicted and sentenced the accused persons\nF\nG\nH\n976 SUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2013] 9 S.C.R.\nA in the manner mentioned in the beginning of this judgment.\nB\nC\nJUDGMENT OF THE HIGH COURT:\n16. A perusal of the impugned judgment reveals that as\nmany as six arguments were advanced before the High Court,\nattacking the findings of the learned Trial Court. Taking note of\nthese grounds of appeal, the High Court framed the questions\nin Para 12 of the judgment. We reproduce hereinbelow those\nsix questions formulated by the High Court which reflected the\nnature of defence:\n(i)\n(ii)\nD\nE\nF\nG\nI\nWhether Section 50 of NDPS Act is complied with\nor not?\nWhether the provision of Section 42 of NDPS Act\nis complied with or not?\n(iii) Whether non-examination of drivers and non-\nseizure of vehicle/ car are fatal to the case of the\nprosecution?\n(iv) Whether Section 67 statement of the accused is\nreliable?\n(v)\nWhether Accused No. 2 is entitled to invoke Section\n30 of NDPS Act?\n(vi) Whether conviction and sentence passed by the\ntrial court is sustainable.\n17. Obviously, all these questions have been answered by\nthe High Court against the appellant herein as the outcome of\nthe appeals has gone against the appellant. However, it is not\nnecessary to mention the reasons/ rationale given by the High\nCourt in support of its conclusion in respect of each and every\nissue. We say so because of the reason that all the aforesaid\ncontentions were not canvassed before us in the present\nappeal. Thus, eschewing the discussion which is not relevant\nTOFAN SINGH v. STATE OF TAMIL NADU\n[A.K.SIKRI, J.]\n977\nfor these appeals, we would be narrating the reasons contained A\nin the impugned judgment only in respect of those grounds\nwhich are argued by Mr. Sushil Kumar Jain, learned Counsel\nappearing for the appellant, that too while taking note of and\ndealing with those arguments.\nTHE ARGUMENTS:\n18. After giving brief description of the prosecution case,\nin so far as the alleged involvement of the appellant is\nconcerned. Mr. Sushil Kumar Jain drew our attention to the\nfollowing aspects as per the prosecution case itself:\n(a)\n(b)\nB\nC\nIn the present case in the prior secret information\nwith the police, there was no prior information with\nregard to the appellant herein. The secret\ninformation (Ex. P-72) does not disclose the name D\nof the appellant at all.\nOn the date of incident also, the appellant was found\nsitting on the front seat alongwith the two drivers\nwho have been let off by the investigating agency\nitself and the ambassador car from which the\nrecoveries had been effected has also not been\nseized. The said drivers could have been the best\nwitnesses but they have not been examined by the\nprosecution.\nE\nF\n(c) The recovery of the narcotic substance was made\nat the instance of A1 and A2 (and not the appellant\nherein), who while sitting on the back seat took out\na green colour bag from beneath their seat and\nhanded it over to PW.7. The appellant cannot be G\nsaid to be in conscious possession of the narcotic\nsubstance.\n(d)\nIn the search conducted of the appellant herein, the\nraiding party found Indian currency of Rs. 680/- (vide\nEx. P-11) which is M.O. 15 and two second class\nH\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nFL\nG\n‚òê H\n978\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n(e)\n[2013] 9 S.C.R.\ntrain tickets from Shamgarh to Chennai. Thus no\nincriminating material has been recovered from the\nappellant. Further there is also no recovery of any\nmobile phone from the appellant herein which could\nlink the appellant with the other co-accused.\nThe prosecution case hinges solely upon the\nconfessional statement of the appellant herein (Ex.\nP-9), which was recorded by PW.2 - R. Murugan\nunder Section 67 of the Act, and the same person\nacted as the investigating officer in the present\ncase.\n19. From the above, Mr. Jain argued that there was no\nevidence worth the name implicating the appellant except the\npurported confessional statement of the appellant recorded\nunder Section 67 of the NDPS Act. After drawing the aforesaid\nsketch, Mr. Jain endeavoured to fill therein the colours of\ninnocence in so far as the appellant is concerned with the\nfollowing legal submissions:-\n(I) It was argued that the conviction of the appellant is\nbased upon a purported confessional statement (Ex. P-9]\nrecorded by PW.2 R. Murugan under the provisions of\nSection 67 of the NDPS Act, which did not have any\nevidentiary value. Mr. Jain submitted in this behalf that:\n(a) There is no power under Section 67 of the NDPS\nAct to either record confessions or substantive evidence\nwhich can form basis for conviction of an accused, in as\nmuch as:\n(i)\nThe scheme of the Act does not confer any power\nupon an officer empowered under Section 42 to\nrecord confessions since neither a specific power\nto record confession has been conferred as was\nprovided under Section 15 of the Terrorist and\nDisruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987 (TADA)\nTOFAN SINGH v. STATE OF TAMIL NADU\n(ii)\n[A.K.SIKRI, J.]\n979\nor under Section 32 of the Prevention of Terrorism\nAct, 2002 (POTA) nor the power under Section 67\nis a power to record substantive \"evidence\" as in\nSection 108 of the Customs Act or Section 14 of\nthe Central Excise Act which are deemed to be\njudicial proceedings as specifically provided under\nSection 108(4) of the Customs Act or Section 14(3)\nof the Central Excise Act.\nThe powers under Section 67 has been conferred\nupon an officer under Section 42 so that such\nofficer can effectively perform his functions. The\npower under Section 67 is incidental to and\nintended to enable an officer under Section 42 to\neffectively exercise his powers of entry, search,\nseizure or arrest which is provided under Section\n42 of the Act. The powers under Section 67 are\npowers to \"call for information\" which information.\ncan thereafter form the basis for satisfaction of\n\"reasons to believe by personal knowledge or\ninformation\" appearing in Section 42 and which a\njurisdictional basis and a pre-condition to exercise\npowers under Section 42 of the Act. Absence of\nreasons to believe or information would render the\nexercise under Section 42 of the Act bad in law and\nhence in order to derive the said information power\nhas been conferred under Section 67 to an officer\nempowered under Section 42. This statement is,\ntherefore, merely \"Information\" subject to\ninvestigation and cannot be treated as substantive\nevidence.\n(b) Pitching this argument to the next level, it was submitted\nthat the power under Section 67(c) of the Act is merely a\npower to examine any person acquainted with the facts and\ncircumstances of the case. Such statements are not\nrequired in law to be truthful as provided under Section\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nA\nB\nC\nD\n[L]\nE\nF\nG\nH\n980\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2013] 9 S.C.R.\n161(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code, which required the\nperson making statement to a police officer under Section\n161 Cr.P.C. to make a true statement. Even such a\nstatement made under Section 161 Cr. P.C. is not a\nsubstantive evidence on which a conviction can be based.\nStatements under Section 67 are not required in law to be\ngiven truthfully and hence cannot in any case be treated\nto be a substantive evidence. Further statement under\nSection 67 are not recorded after administration of oath\nas is required under Section 164(5) of the Criminal\nProcedure Code, the officers are not competent to j\nadminister oaths and, therefore, the statements under\nSection 67 cannot be substantive evidence for recording\nconviction.\n(c) Taking the arguments to a still higher pedestal, Mr.\nJain's effort was to demonstrate that the officer recording\nthe statement was a police officer and, therefore, such a\nstatement was hit by Section 25 of the Indian Evidence Act.\nHe submitted that an officer empowered under Section 42\nof the Act has been conferred with substantive powers\nwhich are powers available to a police officer for detection\nand prevention of crime. The learned Counsel placed\nheavy reliance upon the ratio of the judgment of the\nConstitution Bench of this Court in the case of Batku Jyoti\nSawat Vs. State of Mysore 1966 (3) SCC 698 which\naccepted a broader view, as laid down in the case of\nRajaram Jaiswal Vs. State of Bihar 1964 (2) SCR 752\nand State of Punjab Vs. Barkat Ram 1962 (3) SCR 338.\nIt was submitted that in view of the ratio of the above\njudgments, officers empowered under Section 42 and\nconferred with powers to enter, search, seize or arrest are\n\"police officers\" properly so called and hence statements\nmade to such officers would be hit by the provisions of\nSection 25 of the Evidence Act. In any case such officers\nwould come within the meaning of term \"person in\nauthority\" and hence the statements recorded by such\ni\nTOFAN SINGH v. STATE OF TAMIL NADU\n[A.K.SIKRI, J.]\n981\nofficers would be hit by the provisions of Section 24 of the\nEvidence Act especially since the statements were not\nvoluntary and had been retracted by the accused.\nA\n(d) In the alternate, the submission of Mr. Jain was that\neven if it is assumed, without admitting, that Section 67\nB\nconfers powers to record confessions, the status of a\nstatement recorded by an officer under Section 42 of the\nAct can at best be recorded as \"extra judicial confession\"\nand no conviction can be based solely on the basis of extra\njudicial convictions.\n(e) It was also argued that in any case the statement under\nSection 67 was retracted and as such the confession in\nthe present case is a retracted confession which ought to\nhave been investigated and could have been used only to\ncorroborate other evidence and not as a substantive\nevidence itself. He submitted that no conviction can be\nbased on uncorroborated retracted confessional statement\nas held in Noor Aga Vs. State of Punjab 2008 (9) SCALE\n681.\n(II)\nNext submission of Mr. Jain was that there was\ncomplete absence of Fair Investigation and Non-\ncompliance of the provisions of Section 52(3) of the\nAct-\nC\nD\nE\nF\nPointing out that in the present case the appellant had\nbeen arrested by PW.2 - R. Murugan after recording statement\nunder Section 67 of the Act, the Id. Counsel made a fervent plea\nto the effect that it was evident that PW.2 R. Murugan was\nexercising purported powers conferred to an officer under\nSection 42 of the Act. It was submitted that Section 52(3) of G\nthe Act casts an obligation on an officer empowered under\nSection 42 of the Act to forward, without unnecessary delay\nevery person arrested or article seized to either an officer-in-\ncharge of a police station or an officer empowered under\nSection 53.
