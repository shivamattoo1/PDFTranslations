Invoking the right to life\nand liberty of the three named petitioners, as enshrined\nin Art. 21 of the Constitution, it was prayed that a writ of D\nhabeas corpus be issued commanding the opposite\nparties, particularly, respondent no. 6, to produce the\npetitioners before the Court. The writ petition was listed\nbefore a single Judge of the High Court. Meanwhile\nanother Writ Petition No. 125 of 2011 was filed by E\nrespondent no. 8, acting as the next friend of the three\npetitioners, stating that a false Writ Petition No. 111 of\n2011 was filed by the appellant as next friend of the\npetitioners, which was publically motivated to harm the\nreputation of the opposite party. This petition was listed\nbefore a Division Bench of the High Court, which directed\ntransfer of W.P. No. 111 of 2011 and tagging of the same\nwith W.P. No. 125 of 2011, and issued notice to the\nDirector General of Police to file a personal affidavit.\nDuring investigation, it was revealed that the three named\npetitioners had shifted to a village in a different district. It\nwas stated that they never instructed any person to filed\nany writ petition on their behalf. The three petitioners\nnamed in the writ petition were produced before the\nCourt. On 7.3.2011, the Division Bench passed a detailed\nF\nG\nH\n-\n736\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2012] 9 S.C.R.\nA order in Writ Petition No. 125 of 2011, disposing of Writ\nPetition No. 111 of 2011 with a cost of Rs.50,00,000/- and\npartly disposing of writ petition No. 125 of 2011. The High\nCourt directed that out of the said amount, Rs.25,00,000/\n- would be paid to the girl, Rs.20,00,000/- to respondent\nB no. 6 and Rs 5,00,000/- to the Director General of Police\nfor producing the alleged detenues within the time frame\nas directed in the order. Further, the Director, CBI was\ndirected to register a case against the appellant and all\nother persons involved in the plot. Aggrieved, the next\nC friend in W.P. No. 111 of 2011 filed the appeal.\nDisposing of the appeal, the Court\nHELD:\nD 1. Whether transfer of Writ Petition No. 111/2011 was in\naccordance with law, and whether there was violation of\nPrinciples of Natural Justice?\nE\n1.1. In terms of proviso to Rule 1 of Chapter XXI of\nthe Allahabad High Court Rules, it is provided that an\napplication under Art. 226 of the Constitution in the nature\nof habeas corpus directed against private custody shall\nbe made to the Single Judge appointed by the Chief\nJustice to receive such an application. The clear analysis\nof the Rule shows that habeas corpus against a private\nF custody has to be placed before a Single Judge while in\nthe case of custody other than private custody, the matter\nhas to be placed before a Division Bench. It appears that\non the strength of this Rule, Writ Petition No. 111/2011\nwas listed before the Single Judge of High Court. The\nG roster and placing of cases before different Benches of\nthe High Court is unquestionably the prerogative of the\nChief Justice of that Court. In absence of the Chief\nJustice, the senior most Judge would pass directions in\nregard to the roster of Judges and listing of cases.\nH Primarily, it is the exclusive prerogative of the Chief\nKISHORE SAMRITE v. STATE OF U.P. \u0026 ORS. 737\nJustice and does not admit any ambiguity or doubt in this\nregard. [para 24] [765-B-H]\nState of Rajasthan v. Prakash Chand \u0026 Ors., 1997 (6)\nSuppl. SCR 1 = (1998) 1 SCC 1; State of Uttar Pradesh \u0026\nOrs. v. Neeraj Choubey and Ors. 2010 (11) SCR 542 = (2010)\n10 SCC 320\nA\nB\n1.2. In the instant case, there is no dispute to the fact\nthat no order was passed by the Chief Justice of the High\nCourt or even the senior-most Judge, administratively\nIncharge of the Lucknow Bench, transferring Writ Petition C\nNo. 111/2011 for hearing from a Single Judge before\nwhich it was pending, to the Division Bench of that Court.\nOn the basis of the allegations made in Writ Petition No.\n111/2011, that matter had been listed before the Single\nJudge. It does not appear to be apt exercise of jurisdiction D\nby the Division Bench to suo motu direct transfer of Writ\nPetition No. 111/2011 without leave of the Chief Justice,\nas such action would ex facie amount to dealing with\nmatters relating to constitution and roster of Benches.\n[para 28] [769-B-E]\nE\nF\n1.3. Transfer of a petition may not necessarily result\nin lack of inherent jurisdiction. It may be an administrative\nlapse but normally would not render the Division Bench\nor court of competent jurisdiction as lacking inherent\njurisdiction and its orders being invalid ab initio. Such an\norder may necessarily not be vitiated in law, particularly,\nwhen the parties participate in the proceedings without\nany objection and protest. This, however, always will\ndepend on the facts and circumstances of a given case.\nIn the instant case, suffices it to note that transfer of Writ G\nPetition No. 111/2011 by the Division Bench to its own\nBoard was an order lacking administrative judicial\npropriety. [para 28] [769-F-H; 770-A]\nH\nA\nB\nC\n738\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2012] 9 S.C.R.\n1.4. Compliance with the principle of audi alteram\npartem and other allied principles of natural justice is the\nbasic requirement of rule of law. In fact, it is the essence\nof judicial and quasi-judicial functioning and, particularly,\nthe courts would not finally dispose of a matter without\ngranting notice and adequate hearing to the parties to the\nlis. From the record, i.e. in the orders dated 4.3.2011 as\nwell as 7.3.2011 passed by the High Court, it has not been\nspecifically recorded nor is it implicitly clear that a notice\nwas directed to the petitioners in Writ Petition No.111/\n2011 and they were given opportunity to address the\ncourt. Lack of clarity in this behalf does raise a doubt in\nthe mind of the court that the appellant did not get a fair\nopportunity to put forward his case before the Division\nBench. [para 23] [764-B-E]\nD Abuse of the process of Court :\nE\nF\nG\n☐ H\n2.1. The cases of abuse of the process of court and\nsuch allied matters have been arising before the courts\nconsistently. Some of the principles, emerging from\nvarious decisions are enumerated as follows:\n(i)\nThe people, who approach the court for relief\non an ex parte statement, are under a contract\nwith the court that they would state the whole\ncase fully and fairly to the court and where the\nlitigant has broken such faith, the discretion of\nthe court cannot be exercised in favour of\nsuch a litigant. [para 29(ii)] [770-D, G-H; 771-A]\n(ii) The obligation to approach the court with\nclean hands is an absolute obligation and has\nrepeatedly been reiterated by this court. [para\n29(iii)] [771-B]\n(iii)\nA litigant who attempts to pollute the stream of\njustice or who touches the pure fountain of\nKISHORE SAMRITE v. STATE OF U.P. \u0026 ORS. 739\njustice with tainted hands is not entitled to any A\nrelief, interim or final. [para 29(v)] [771-D]\n(iv) The court must ensure that its process is not\nabused and in order to prevent abuse of the\nprocess the court, it would be justified even in\ninsisting on furnishing of security and in cases\nof serious abuse, the court would be duty\nbound to impose heavy costs. [para 29(vi)]\n[771-E]\nB\n(v) Wherever a public interest is invoked, the court C\nmust examine the petition carefully to ensure\nthat there is genuine public interest involved.\nThe stream of justice should not be allowed to\nbe polluted by unscrupulous litigants. [para\n29(vii)] [771-F]\n(vi)\nThe court, especially the Supreme Court, has\nto maintain strictest vigilance over the abuse\nof the process of court and ordinarily\nmeddlesome bystanders should not be\ngranted \"visa\". Many societal pollutants create\nnew problems of unredressed grievances and\nthe Court should endure to take cases where\nthe justice of the lis well-justifies it. [para\n29(viii)] [771-G-H; 772-A]\nD\nE\nF\nG\n2.2. It is the bounden duty of the court to ensure that\ndishonesty and any attempt to surpass the legal process\nmust be effectively curbed and the court must ensure\nthat there is no wrongful, unauthorised or unjust gain to\nanyone as a result of abuse of the process of the court.\nOne way to curb this tendency is to impose realistic or\npunitive costs. The legal maxim jure naturae aequum est\nneminem cum alterius detrimento et injuria fieri\nlocupletiorem, means that it is a law of nature that one\nshould not be enriched by the loss or injury to another, H\n740\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2012] 9 S.C.R.\nA is the percept for Courts. Wide jurisdiction of the court\nshould not become a source of abuse of the process of\nlaw by the disgruntled litigant. Careful exercise is also\nnecessary to ensure that the litigation is genuine, not\nmotivated by extraneous considerations and imposes an\nB obligation upon the litigant to disclose the true facts and\napproach the court with clean hands.

No. 111 of 2011\nand W.P. 125 of 2011, it is clear that next friends in both\nthe petitions are guilty of suppressing material facts,\napproaching the court with unclean hands, filing petitions\nwith ulterior motive and finally for abusing the process\nof the court. They have misled the courts by showing\nH urgency and exigencies in relation to an incident of\nKISHORE SAMRITE v. STATE OF U.P. \u0026 ORS.\n741\nB\n3.12.2006 which, in fact, according to the three petitioners A\nand the police was false. They maliciously and with\nulterior motives encroached upon the valuable time of the\ncourt and wasted public money. The privilege of easy\naccess to justice has been abused by these persons by\nfiling frivolous and misconceived petitions. On the basis\nof incorrect and incomplete allegations, they had created\nurgency for expeditious hearing of the petitions, which\nnever existed. Even this Court had to spend days to\nreach at the truth. Prima facie it is clear that both these\npersons have mis-stated the facts, withheld true facts and\neven gave false and incorrect affidavits. They knew well\nthat Courts are going to rely upon their pleadings and\naffidavits while passing appropriate orders. The Director\nGeneral of Police, U.P., was required to file an affidavit and\nCBI was directed to conduct investigation. Truth being\nthe basis of justice delivery system, it was important for\nthis Court to reach at the truth, which it has been able to\nreach at with the able assistance of all the counsel. [para\n37 and 45] [775-D; 779-G-H; 780-A-D]\nC\nD\n2.4. The alleged incident which, according to the E\npetitioners, police and the CBI, never happened and\nillegal detention of the petitioners has been falsified by\nthe petitioners themselves in the writ petitions. It is a\nmatter of regret that the process of the court has been\nabused by unscrupulous litigants just to attain publicity F\nand adversely affect the reputation of another politician,\nrespondent No.6. One of the obvious reasons which can\nreasonably be inferred from the peculiar facts and\ncircumstances of the case is the political rivalry. It is said\nto be a case of political mudslinging. It has been rightly G\npointed out that the websites information was nothing\nbut secondary evidence, but not even an iota of evidence\nhas been placed on record of the writ petitions before the\nHigh Court or even in the appeal before this Court, which\ncould show even the remotest possibility of happening\nH\n742\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2012] 9 S.C.R.\nA of the alleged rape incident on 3.12.2006. The\nmethodology adopted by the next friends in the writ\npetitions before the High Court was opposed to political\nvalues and administration of justice. If such petitions are\nnot properly regulated and abuse averted, it becomes a\nB tool in unscrupulous hands to release vendetta and\nwreak vengeance as well.

This Court holds that the cases of both the\npetitioners suffered from falsehood, were misconceived\nand were patent misuse of judicial process. Abuse of the\nprocess of the court and not approaching the court with\ncomplete facts and clean hands, has compelled this Court\nto impose heavy and penal costs on the persons acting\nas next friends in the writ petitions before the High Court.\nThis Court cannot permit the judicial process to become\nan instrument of oppression or abuse or to subvert\njustice by unscrupulous litigants like the appellant and\nrespondent no. 8 in the instant case.
