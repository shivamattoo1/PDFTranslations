S.C.R.\n\"The object of the Act is thus to constitute one common\nBar for the whole country and to provide machinery for its\nregulated functioning. Since the Act sets up one Bar,\nautonomous in its character, the Bar Councils set up\nthereunder have been entrusted with the power to regulate\nthe working of the profession and to prescribe rules of\nprofessional conduct and etiquette, and the power to\npunish those who commit breach of such rules. The power\nof punishment is entrusted to the disciplinary committees\nensuring a trial of an advocate by his peers. Sections 35,\n36 and 37 lay down the procedure for trying complaints,\npunishment and an appeal to the Bar Council of India from\nthe orders passed by the State Bar Councils. As an\nadditional remedy section 38 provides a further appeal to\nthe Supreme Court. Though the Act relates to the lega!\npractitioners, in its pith and substance it is an enactment\nwhich concerns itself with the qualifications, enrollment,\nright to practise and discipline of the advocates. As\nprovided by the Act once a person is enrolled by any one\nof the State Bar Councils, he becomes entitled to practise\nin all courts including the Supreme Court. As aforesaid, the\nAct creates one common Bar, all its members being of\none class, namely, advocates. Since all those who have\nbeen enrolled have a right to practise in the Supreme Court\nand the High Courts, the Act is a piece of legislation which\ndeals with persons entitled to practise before the Supreme\nCourt and the High Courts. Therefore the Act must be held\nto fall within entries 77 and 78 of List I. As the power of\nlegislation relating to those entitled to practise in the\nSupreme Court and the High Courts is carved out from the\ngeneral power to legislate in relation to legal and other\nprofessions in entry 26 of List III, it is an error to say, as\nthe High Court did, that the Act is a composite legislation\npartly falling under entries 77 and 78 of List I and partly\nunder entry 26 of List III.”\nC. VENKATACHALAM v. AJITKUMAR C. SHAH AND 835\nORS. [DALVEER BHANDARI, J.]\n21. In Harishankar Rastogi v. Girdhari Sharma and A\nAnother (1978) 2 SCC 165, the court held as under:-\nB\n\"Advocates are entitled as of right to practise in this Court\n(Section 30(i) of the Advocates Act, 1961). But, this\nprivilege cannot be claimed as of right by any one else.\nWhile it is true that Article 19 of the Constitution guarantees\nthe freedom to practise any profession, it is open to the\nState to make a law imposing, in the interest of the general\npublic, reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right.\nThe Advocates Act, by Section 29, provides for such a\nC\nreasonable restriction, namely, that the only class of\npersons entitled to practise the profession of law shall be\nadvocates. Even so, is it not open to a party who is unable\nfor some reason or other to present his case adequately\nto seek the help of another person in this behalf? To\nnegative such a plea may be to deny justice altogether in\ncertain cases, especially in a land of illiteracy and\nindigence and judicial processes of a sophisticated\nnature. That is precisely why legislative policy has taken\ncare to provide for such contingencies. Sections 302, 303\nand 304 of the Criminal Procedure Code are indicative of E\nthe policy of the legislature. I do not think that in this Court\nwe should totally shut out representation by any person\nother than the party himself in situations where an advocate\nis not appearing for the party....”\n22. Mr. Paul appearing for the appellants also gave\nreference to international law and conventions to strengthen his\nsubmissions that only advocates enrolled with the respective\nBar Councils alone can practise in the Consumer Forums and\nthe agents cannot appear. He submitted that practice under the\nConsumer Protection Act, 1986 requires extensive legal skills\nwhich only a trained legal practitioner possesses and he alone\ncan discharge those functions. He submitted that the agents\nhave no legal training to handle complicated legal matters\npertaining to consumers and hence the agents cannot be\npermitted to practise law before the Consumer Forums.\nD\nF\nG\nH\n836 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2011] 13 (ADDL.) S.C.R.\nA Historical perspective of the consumer movement\nB\n23. The consumer movement had primarily started in the\nWest. We can trace history of the consumer movement from\nthe judgment of the leading case Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball\nCompany 1893 (1) Q.B. 256. In this case first time\nManufacturers' liability for minimum quality standard for product\nwas established.\n24. For the first time in 1856 a select committee\nrecommended that a cheap and easy remedy, by a summary\nC charge before a magistrate, should be afforded to consumers\nwho received adulterated or falsely described food. This\nsuggestion was taken up in the Merchandise Marks Act, 1887.\nSection 17 of the Act provides as follows:\nD\nE\n\"That a person applying a trade description to a product\nwas deemed to warrant that it was true, so that a false\ntrade description constituted breach of both criminal and\ncivil law.\"\n25. In a leading English case Donoghue v. Stevenson\n(1932) A.C. 562, where the consumer claimed to have suffered\ninjury as well as result of drinking from a bottle of ginger-beer\ncontaining a decomposed snail. Over a strong dissent the\nmajority held that the manufacturer would be liable. The case\ndid not herald strict liability but it facilitated more claims than\nF were provided under the nineteenth century approach. Lord\nAtkin enunciated the manufacturer's duty of care in the following\nwords:\nG\nH\n..the preparation or putting up of the products will\nresult in an injury to the consumer's life or property, owes\na duty to the consumer to take that reasonable care.\"\n26. This theory of strict liability already exists under the\nConsumer Protection Act, 1961.\nC. VENKATACHALAM v. AJITKUMAR C. SHAH AND 837\nORS. [DALVEER BHANDARI, J.]\n27. The organized English consumer movement started A\nafter the Second World War. The Labour Party for the first time\ngave slogan of \"battle for the consumers\" in Parliament. In the\ndecade of 1960, number of legislations were introduced in\nBritain for the protection of the consumers. The Consumer\nSafety Act, 1978 was enacted.\nUnited States of America\nB\n28. The consumer movement in the United States of\nAmerica developed in the beginning of the 19th century when\nin Donald C. MacPherson v. Buick Motor Company 217 N.Y. C\n382, 111 N.E. 1050 the New York Court of Appeal observed\nthat a car manufacturer had to compensate a consumer who\nhad been injured when one of the car wheels collapsed because\nof defect. The court held that the manufacturer had been\nnegligent because the defect could have been discovered by D\nreasonable inspection. In 1972, the Consumer Product Safety\nAct was enacted.\n29. Paul S. Boyer, a distinguished author, in his article on\n\"Consumer Movement\", published by The Oxford Companion\nto United States History, 2001, has mentioned about the\nmodern consumer movement. The relevant following extract is\ninstructive and is reproduced as under.\nE\nF\n\"The modern consumer movement arose in the\nProgressive Era, as citizens concerned about unsafe\nproducts and environmental hazards used lobbying, voting,\nand journalistic exposés to press for government\nprotection. In the same vein, the Consumers Union (1936),\npublisher of Consumer Reports, tests products for safety,\neconomy, and reliability, to give consumers an objective G\nbasis for choice.\n.... Such socially engaged consumerism actually had\nlong historical antecedents, including Revolutionary Era\npatriots who had boycotted English tea and textiles and\nH\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\n838 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2011] 13 (ADDL.) S.C.R.\nabolitionists who had refused to purchase goods made of\nslave ]produced cotton.\nConsumer activism revived in the late 1960s, flourished in\nthe 1970s, and, despite a conservative backlash against\ngovernment regulation, survived in diminished form in the\n1990s. A by ]product of 1960s social activism, consumer\nadvocates insisted on citizens' rights to safe and\nreasonably priced goods and services and to the full\ndisclosure of product information. The lawyer Ralph Nader\ngained fame for Unsafe at Any Speed (1965), which\ndetailed safety hazards plaguing General Motors' (GM)\nCorvair automobile. Using $425,000 won in an\ninvasion of privacy suit against GM in 1970, Nader\nfounded numerous consumer groups, nicknamed \"Nader's\nRaiders,\" that pursued legal challenges to unsafe products\nand demanded greater government protection for\nconsumers. The formation of the Consumer Federation of\nAmerica (1968). the Occupational Safety and Health\nAdministration (1970), and the Consumer Product Safety\nCommission (1972) attested to the movement's success.\nbut also to its regulatory and legalistic bent. Focused on\nconsumers' rights, the modern movement downplayed the\npower of consumers to effect social change.\"\n30. Ralph Nader played an extremely important role in\nF consumer movement in the United States of America. A note\nappears in \"America in Ferment: The Tumultuous 1960s -\nRalph Nader and the Consumer Movement.' An extract is\nreproduced. It reads :-\nG\nI\n\"Ralph Nader has been called the nation's nag. He\ndenounced soft drinks for containing excessive amounts\nof sugar (more than nine teaspoons a can). He warned\nAmericans about the health hazards of red dyes used as\nfood colorings and of nitrates used as preservatives in hot\ndogs. He even denounced high heels: \"It is part of the whole\ntyranny of fashion, where women will inflict pain on\nC. VENKATACHALAM v. AJITKUMAR C. SHAH AND 839\nORS. [DALVEER BHANDARI, J.]\nthemselves ... for what, to please men.\" Since the mid- A\n1960s, Ralph Nader has been the nation's leading\nconsumer advocate.\"\n31. Ralph Nader is an extraordinary example of total\ndevotion to the cause. It is men like him who leave an imprint\nand make history. Consumer movements all over the world have\ntaken great inspiration from Ralph Nader.\n00\nB\n32. Every year 15th March is observed as the World\nConsumer Rights Day. On that day in 1962 President John F.\nKennedy of the United States called upon the United States C\nCongress to accord its approval to the Consumer Bill of Rights.\nThey are (i) right to choice; (ii) right to information; (iii) right to\nsafety; and (iv) right to be heard. President Gerald R. Ford\nadded one more right i.e. right to consumer education. Further\nother rights such as right to healthy environment and right to D\nbasic needs (food, clothing and shelter) were added.\nUnfortunately, in most of the countries these rights are still not\navailable to the consumers. In India 24th December every year\ncelebrated as National Consumer Rights Day.\n33. The General Assembly of the United Nations adopted\na set of general guidelines for consumer protection\nand the Secretary General of the United Nations\nwas authorized to persuade member countries to\nadopt these guidelines through policy changes or\nlaw. These guidelines constitute a comprehensive\npolicy framework outlining what governments need\nto do to promote consumer protection in following\n(i)\nseven areas:\nPhysical safety;\n(ii) Protection and Promotion of the consumer\neconomic interest;\nE\nF\nG\n(iii) Standards for the safety and quality of consumer\nH\ngoods and services;\nA\n840 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2011] 13 (ADDL.) S.C.R.\n(iv) Distribution facilities for consumer goods and\nservices;\n(v)\nMeasures enabling consumers to obtain redress;\n(vi)\nB\nMeasures relating to specific areas (food, water\nand pharmaceuticals); and\nC\nD\nE\nF\n(vii) Consumer education and information programme.\n34. Though not legally binding, the guidelines provide an\ninternationally recognized set of basic objectives particularly for\ngovernments of developing and newly independent countries\nfor structuring and strengthening their consumer protection\npolicies and legislations. These guidelines were adopted\nrecognizing that consumers often face imbalances in economic\nterms, educational levels and bargaining power and bearing in\nmind that consumers should have the right of access to non\nhazardous products as well as the importance of promoting just,\nequitable and sustainable economic and social development.\nIndian perspective\n35. It was in this background that the Indian Parliament had\nenacted the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. The declared\nobjective of the statute was \"to provide for better protection of\nthe interests of consumers.\" It seeks to provide a speedy and\ninexpensive remedy to the consumer.\n36. The Consumer Protection Act, 1986 is one of the\nbenevolent social legislations intended to protect the large body\nof consumers from exploitation. The Act has come as a\npanacea for consumers all over the country and is considered\nG as one of the most important legislations enacted for the benefit\nof the consumers. The Consumer Protection Act, 1986\nprovides inexpensive and prompt remedy.\nH\n37. The Consumer Protection Act, 1986 is dedicated, as\nits preamble shows, to provide for effective protection of the\nC. VENKATACHALAM v. AJITKUMAR C. SHAH AND 841\nORS. [DALVEER BHANDARI, J.]\nrights of the consumers. According to the Statement of Objects A\nand Reasons, it seeks to provide speedy and simple redressal\nto consumer disputes. The object of the Act is to render simple,\ninexpensive and speedy remedy to the consumers with\ncomplaints against defective goods and deficient services and\nfor that a quasi-judicial machinery has been sought to be set B\nup at the District, State and Central levels. The Consumer\nProtection Act has come to meet the long-felt necessity of\nprotecting common man from wrongs for which the remedy\nunder the ordinary law for various reasons has become illusory.\n38. The Consumer Protection Act, 1986 was amended in\nthe years 1991, 1993 and in 2002 to make it more effective\nand purposeful.\nC\n39. To effectuate this objective, a provision has been made\nin Chapter II of the Act for the constitution of 'the Central D\nConsumer Protection Council' and 'the State Consumer\nProtection Councils.\" The purpose as indicted in section 6 is\nto “promote and protect the rights of consumers\" against the\n\"marketing of goods and services which are hazardous to life\nand property; the right to be informed about the quality, quantity, E\npotency, purity, standard and price of goods or services, as the\ncase may be, so as to protect the consumer against unfair trade\npractices; the right to be assured, wherever possible, access\nto a variety of goods and services at competitive prices; the\nright to be heard and to be assured that consumer's interests\nwill receive due consideration at appropriate Forums; the right\nto seek redressal against unfair trade practices or restrictive\ntrade practices or unscrupulous exploitation of consumers and\nthe right to consumer education.\"\n40. A perusal of Chapter II clearly shows that the statute\nseeks to protect the 'consumer' of goods and services in every\npossible way. It aims at providing a speedy and inexpensive\nremedy. Any interpretation of the provisions of the 1986 Act and\nthe rules framed thereunder must promote this objective of the\nenactment.\nF\nG\nН\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n842 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2011] 13 (ADDL.) S.C.R.\n41. In furtherance of the declared objective of protecting\nthe consumer against exploitation as well as providing an\ninexpensive and speedy remedy, the competent authority has\nframed Rules which enable the party to appear either personally\nor through an 'agent'.\n42. The issue is - Do the Rules permit a party to have an\n'Agent' for merely presenting the papers on its behalf or can\nthe Agent even act and argue?\nMaharashtra Consumer Protection Rules, 1987\nRule 2(b) defines an Agent to mean “a person duly\nauthorized by a party to present any complaint,\nappeal or reply on its behalf before the State\nCommission or the District Forum.\"\nUnder Rule 4(7), the parties are obliged to either\nappear personally or through \"authorized agent.\" If\n\"the complainant or his authorized agent fails to\nappear before the District Forum\" it may \"in its\ndiscretion either dismiss the complaint for default\nor decide it on merit.\" Similarly, \"where the opposite\nparty (defendant) or its authorized agent fails to\nappear on the day of hearing, the District Forum\nmay decide the complaint ex parte.\"\nA perusal of the provisions show that while the\nadvocates have not been debarred from pleading\nand appearing, the parties have been given an\noption to either appear personally or be\nrepresented by \"duly authorized\" agents. Every\nadvocate appointed by a party is an agent.\nHowever, the agent as contemplated under the rules\nneed not necessarily be an advocate.\nThe provision in the Rules promotes the object of\nthe statute. It is meant to help the consumer to\nC. VENKATACHALAM v. AJITKUMAR C. SHAH AND 843\nORS. [DALVEER BHANDARI, J.}\nvindicate his right without being burdened with A\nintricate procedures and heavy professional fees.\nIn the very nature of things, the disputes under the\n1986 Act can involve claims for small amounts of\nmoney by way of compensation. Engagement of\nadvocates in all such matters may not be\neconomically viable. It is equally possible that the\nclaim may involve professional expertise. To\nillustrate: A person may sue a hospital for medical\nnegligence. Or an Architect for a faulty design. Or\na building contractor for defective work. In such\ncases, a professional like a doctor, architect or an\nengineer may be more suitable than an advocate.\nThus, both the parties have been given an option\nto choose from an advocate or any other person\nwho may even be a professional expert in the\nparticular field.\nB\nC\nD\n43. Such an interpretation is not only literally correct but\nalso promotes the declared objective of the statute. It helps the\nclaimant and the defendant equally. It does not violate any E\nprovision of the Advocates Act.\n44. The Consumer Protection Act, 1986 was amended in\nthe year 2002, in pursuance to the United Nations resolution\npassed in April, 1985 indicating certain guidelines under which\nthe Government could make law for better protection of the\ninterest of the consumers. Such laws were necessary,\nparticularly in the developing countries to protect the consumers\nfrom hazards to their health and safety and to provide them\navailable speedier and cheaper redressal of their grievances.\n45. The amended Act 62 of 2002 reads as under:\n\"Amendment Act 62 of 2002. - The enactment of the\nConsumer Protection Act, 1986 was an important\nmilestone in the history of the consumer movement in the\nI\nF\nG\nI\n"}
