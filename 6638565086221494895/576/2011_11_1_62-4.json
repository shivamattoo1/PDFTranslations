A comparison of the two sets of provisions would\nshow that section 44, the definition clause in the 1996 Act is\na verbatim reproduction of section 2 of the previous Act (but\nfor the words \"chapter\" in place of \"Act\", \"first schedule\" in\nplace of \"schedule\" and the addition of the word \"arbitral\" before\nthe word \"award\" in section 44). Section 45 corresponds to\nsection 3 of the previous Act. Section 46 is a verbatim\nG reproduction of section 4(2) except for the substitution of the\nword \"chapter\" for \"Act\". Section 47 is almost a reproduction\nof section 8 except for the addition of the words \"before the\ncourt\" \"in sub-section (1)\" and an explanation as to what is\nmeant by \"court\" in that section. Section 48 corresponds to\nsection 7; section 49 to section 6(1) and section 50 to section\nH\nFUERST DAY LAWSON LTD. v. JINDAL EXPORTS 49\nLTD. [AFTAB ALAM, J.]\n6(2). Apart from the fact that the provisions are arranged in a A\nfar more orderly manner, it is to be noticed that the provisions\nof the 1996 Act are clearly aimed at facilitating and expediting\nthe enforcement of the New York Convention Awards. Section\n3 of the 1961 Act dealing with a stay of proceedings in respect\nof matters to be referred to arbitration was confined in its B\napplication to \"legal proceedings in any court\" and the court\nhad a wider discretion not to stay the proceedings before it.\nThe corresponding provision in section 45 of the present Act\nhas a wider application and it covers an action before any\njudicial authority. Further, under section 45 the judicial authority C\nhas a narrower discretion to refuse to refer the parties to\narbitration. Under section 4(1) of the 1961 Act, a foreign award\nfor its enforcement was first deemed to be an award made on\na matter referred to arbitration in India. Section 46 of the present\nAct dispenses with the provision of sub-section (1) of section\n4 and resultantly a foreign award is enforceable in its own\nright. Section 47 is almost a reproduction of section 8 except\nfor the addition of the words \"before the court\" in sub-section\n(1) and an explanation as to what is meant by \"court\" at the\nend of the section. Section 49 corresponds to section 6(1)\nand section 50 to section 6(2). It is however, a comparison of\nsection 6 of the 1961 Act with section 49 of the present Act\nthat would be of interest to us and that provides a direct answer\nto the question under consideration. As the comparison of the\ntwo sections is of some importance, the two sections are once\nagain reproduced here:\nThe Foreign Awards (Recognition and Enforcement) Act,\n1961\n\"6. Enforcement of foreign award.-(1) Where the court is\nsatisfied that the foreign award is enforceable under this\nAct, the court shall order the award to be filed and shall\nproceed to pronounce judgment according to the award.\n(2) Upon the judgment so pronounced a decree shall follow,\nD\nE\nF\nG\nI\n50\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2011] 11 S.C.R.\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nand no appeal shall lie from such decree except in so far\nas the decree is in excess of or not in accordance with\nthe award.\"\nThe Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\n\"49. Enforcement of foreign awards.-Where the Court is\nsatisfied that the foreign award is enforceable under this\nChapter, the award shall be deemed to be a decree of that\nCourt.\"\n57. Under section 6 of the 1961 Act, the Court on being\nsatisfied that the foreign award was enforceable under the Act,\nwould first order the award to be filed and then proceed to\npronounce judgment according to the award. The judgment\nwould lead to a decree against which no appeal would lie\nexcept insofar as the decree was in excess of or not in\naccordance with the award.\n58. Section 49 of the present Act makes a radical change\nin that where the court is satisfied that the foreign award is\nenforceable, the award itself would be deemed to be a decree\nof the Court. It, thus, not only omits the procedural formality for\nthe court to pronounce judgment and a decree to follow on that\nbasis but also completely removes the possibility of the\ndecree being in excess of, or not in accordance with the\naward. Thus, even the limited basis on which an appeal would\nlie under sub-section (2) of section 6 of the 1961 Act, is taken\naway. There is, thus, no scope left for an appeal against an\norder of the court for the enforcement of a foreign award. It is\nfor this reason that section 50(1)(b) provides for an appeal only\nagainst an order refusing to enforce a foreign award under\nG section 48.\nF\nH\n59. There can be no doubt that under section 6, except on\nthe very limited ground, no appeal including a Letters Patent\nAppeal was maintainable against the judgment and decree\npassed by the Court under section 6(1). It would be futile,\n"}
