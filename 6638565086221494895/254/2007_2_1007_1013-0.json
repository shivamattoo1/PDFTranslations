It is not that any unbridled and/or\narbitrary power was given to the authorities as held by the High Court. In\nfact, the parameters of exercise of power are inbuilt in Clause 10. Reasons\nwere required to be recorded. This was to be done objectively and not\nsubjectively as appears to have been concluded by the High Court. Looked at\nfrom any angle, the High Court's judgment is indefensible. [Para 14]\nB\nC\n[1013-B-D]\nK. Ramanathan v.

No. 2689/1998.\nAltaf Ahmad, Neelam Sharma and Tara Chandra Sharma for the\nD Appellants.\nE\nSarla Chandra for the Respondents.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nDR. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. 1. Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment\nrendered by a Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court holding that clauses\n9 and 10 of the Notification No.4784-F.S./FS/Sectt/Food/148-1/97, dated\n19.12.1997 issued in exercise of the powers conferred by Section 3 of the\nEssential Commodities Act, 1955 (in short the ‘Act') read with Government\nof India, Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation (Department of Food) Order\nF No. G.S.R. 800 dated 8th June, 1978 was contrary to the policy declared under\nthe Foreign Trade Development and Regulation Act, 1992 (in short 'Foreign\nTrade Act'). Accordingly, it was held as follows:\nG\n“In view of our findings aforementioned it must be held that the order\ndoes not conform to the policy laid down by the Central Government\nin exercise of its power conferred upon it under Section 5 of the 1992\nAct inasmuch as in terms thereof, the Central Government could not\neven itself interfere with the proclaimed policy relating to import and\nexport adopted by it in terms of Section 5 of the 1992 Act.\"\n2. By the abovesaid notification order in question was made which was\nH called West Bengal Rice and Paddy Control Order, 1997 (for short 'the Control\n+\nTHE STATE OF WEST BENGAL v. VEEJAY INTERNATIONAL (INDIA) [PASAYAT, J.] 1009\nOrder').\n3. Background facts in a nutshell are as follows:\nA\n4. The notification in question was issued purportedly with a view to\nregulate the price and availability of rice in the State of West Bengal. The\nState Government in exercise of delegated power given under the Act, by the B\nnotification No.G.S.R. 800 dated 8th June, 1978 promulgated West Bengal Rice\nand Paddy (Restriction on Movement) Order, 1981 (in short 'Movement Order').\n5. Clause 5 of the said order authorizes Officers to enter into any\npremises and make search and seizure of essential commodities or vehicle etc.\nVires of the said orders were considered by a Division Bench of Calcutta High C\nCourt.\n6. Thereafter, the Control Order was issued. Clauses 9 and 10 of the said\nControl Order are relevant for the purpose of the present dispute. They read\nas follows:-\n\"9. Regulation of storage of rice and paddy for export\n(1) No person shall store or attempt to store or transport any quantity\nof rice or paddy procured for export without a valid permit in Form\n'D' granted by the Director or by the Controller, if so authorized\nby the Government.\n(2) In the case of transshipment of stocks from one vehicle to another\nin exigencies, by an exporter without a valid permit such\ntransshipment shall be made only with the prior permission of the\nnearest Controller, stating in total the reason for such\ntransshipment.\n10. Regulation of export of rice produced in West Bengal -\nNo person shall export or attempt to export any rice or paddy\nproduced or grown in West Bengal without a written authority\ngranted by the Government in this behalf, and if the Government\nor such authorized officer is satisfied that such export of rice will\nnot adversely affect the price and availability of rice in the local\nmarket, the Government or such authorized officer may grant\nauthority for export of specified quantity and variety of rice as\nmay be determined by the Government or such authorized officer.\"\nᎠ\nE\nF\nG\nH\nA\nB\nC\nD\n(I)\nE\nF\nG\n1010\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 2 S.C.R.\n7. Respondent filed a writ petition before the Calcutta High Court\nquestioning the legality of the aforesaid clauses primarily on the ground that\nthey were repugnant and inconsistent with the policy declared by the Foreign\nTrade Act. The State took the stand that the clauses in question are regulatory\nin nature and do not suffer from any infirmity.\n8. The High Court accepted the challenge and, inter alia, concluded as\nfollows:\n\"Clause 9(1) of the Control Order deals with restriction on transport\nwhereas; clause 4.21 of the export and import policy framed by the\nCentral Government under Section 5 of the 1992 Act clearly states that\nitems allowed for export shall not be withheld/delayed for any reason\nby any agency of the Central or State Government. Both the provisions,.\nthus, are in direct conflict with each other. Clause 9.2, provides for a\nprior permission of the nearest controller when transshipment takes\nplace from one vehicle to another. If clause 9.1 is bad, clause 9.2\ncannot survive independently.\nClause 10 of the Control order is in mandatory form. It totally\nprohibits export or import. It confers absolute unguided, unbridled\nand uncontrolled power upon the authorities named therein to consider\nas to whether a permit for export should be granted or not. By reason\nof an order made under the delegated notifications no authority of the\nState Government can authorize to issue permit for export. Such a\ncontingency is contemplated only in terms of paragraph 5 of the 1992\nOrder. Once in terms of EXIM policy non Basmati rice is considered\nto be free for export which decision must have been taken into\nconsideration by the Central Government upon taking into\nconsideration all aspects of the matter viz. availability thereof in the\ncountry, the quantum of production and the requirement within the\ncourts, the State Government in exercise of its delegated power cannot\nbe held to have any say in the matter. If the State Government has\nany difficulty in relation thereto, it may bring the same to the notice\nof the Central Government so that at the time of registration of such\ncontract entered into by and between the exporter and the foreign\ncountry, the same may borne in mind by the appropriate authority so\nas to restrict number of registrations of contract by and between the\nexporters from India and the Foreign Countries.\"\nH 9. As noted above, an escape route was suggested as would be seen\ni\nTHE STATE OF WEST BENGAL 1. VEEJAY INTERNATIONAL (INDIA)[PASAYAT,J.]' 1011\nfrom the quoted portion of the High Court's order.\nA\n10. In support of the appeal, learned counsel for the appellants submitted\nthat the High Court completely lost sight of the fact that the two clauses were\nregulatory in nature. There was no complete ban on export or import and, it\ncannot be said that there was any absolute, unguided, unbridled and\nuncontrolled power upon the authorities to decide whether the permit for B\nexport shall be granted or not. The purpose was to ensure that the export\ndoes not affect the price in the local market and the availability of stock. As\na matter of fact, there was no conflict as was held by the High Court.\n11. In K. Ramanathan v. State of Tamil Nadu and Anr. [1985] 2 SCC 116\nit was held as follows:\nC\nD\n\"The appellants impugned clause 3(1-A) of the 1982 Order on the\ngrounds that it was ultra vires the State Government being in excess\nof the delegated powers. It was urged (i) that the delegation of a\nspecific power under Section 3(2)(d) of the Essential Commodities Act\nby the Central Government notification dated June 9, 1979 issued\nunder Section 5 of the Act to regulate the storage, transport,\ndistribution, disposal, etc. of an essential commodity, in relation to\nfoodstuffs, does not carry with it the general power of the Central\nGovernment under sub-section (1) of Section 3 to regulate or prohibit\nthe production, supply and distribution thereof and trade and commerce E\ntherein, and (ii) that the word 'regulating' in clause (d) of Section 3(2)\nof the Act does not take in 'prohibiting' and as such there cannot be\na total prohibition on transport, movement or otherwise carrying of\npaddy out of the areas in question under clause (d) but only regulation\nof such activities in the course of trade and commerce by grant of\nlicences or permits.\"\n12. Decision in Harishankar Bagla and Anr. v. The State of Madhya\nPradesh AIR (1954) SC 465 throws considerable light on the controversy. Para\n7 of the judgment read as follows:-\nF\nG\n\"7. The first question canvassed by Mr. Umrigar was that the\nprovisions of Section 3 of the Control Order infringed the rights of a\ncitizen guaranteed in sub-clauses (f) and (g) of Article 19(1) of the\nConstitution. These sub-clauses recognize the right of a citizen to\ndispose of property and to carry on trade or business. The requirement\nof a permit to transport by rail cotton textiles to a certain extent H\n1012\nA\nB\nC\nᎠ\nE\nF\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 2 S.C.R.\noperates as a restriction on the rights of a person who is engaged in\nthe business of purchase and sale of cotton textiles. Clause (5) of\nArticle 19 however permits such restrictions to be placed provided\nthey are in the public interest. During the period of emergency it was\nnecessary to impose control on the production, supply and distribution\nof commodities essential to the life of the community. It was for this\nreason that the Legislature passed the Essential Supplies (Temporary\nPowers) Act authorizing the Central Government to make orders from\ntime to time controlling the production, supply and distribution of\nessential commodities.\n1\nClause 3 of the Control Order does not deprive a citizen of the\nright to dispose of or transport cotton textiles purchased by him. It\nrequires him to take a permit from the Textile Commissioner to enable\nhim to transport them. The requirement of a permit in this regard\ncannot be regarded as an unreasonable restriction on the citizen's\nright under sub-clauses (f) and (g) of Article 19(1). If transport of\nessential commodities by rail or other means of conveyance was left\nuncontrolled it might well have seriously hampered the supply of\nthese commodities to the public. Act XXIV of 1946 was an emergency\nmeasure and as stated in its preamble, was intended to provide for the\ncontinuance during a limited period of powers to control the\nproduction, supply and distribution of, and trade and commerce in,\ncertain commodities. The number of commodities held essential are\nmentioned in Section 2 of the Act, and the requirement of a permit to\ntransport such commodities by road or rail or other means of transport,\ncannot, in any sense of the term, be said, in a temporary Act, to be\nunreasonable restriction on the citizens' rights mentioned in clauses\n(f) and (g) of Article 19(1). The High Court was therefore right in\nnegativing the contention raised regarding the invalidity of the Control\nOrder as abridging the rights of the citizens under Article 19 (1) of the\nConstitution.\"\n13. Section 5 of the Foreign Trade Act authorizes the Central Government\nG to formulate and announce, by notification in the Official Gazette, the export\nand import policy as also to amend the same in like manner. If the clauses 9\nand 10 of the Control Order and Section 5 of the policy of the Foreign Trade\nAct are harmonized, that rules out any conflict. As a matter of fact, Section\n6 of the Act is also of relevance and it reads as follows:\nH\nTHE STATE OF WEST BENGAL v. VEEJAY INTERNATIONAL (INDIA) [PASAYAT, J.] 1013\n\"6. Effect of orders inconsistent with other enactments - Any order A\nmade under section 3 shall have effect notwithstanding anything\ninconsistent therewith contained in any enactment other than this Act\nor any instrument having effect by virtue of any enactment other than\nthis Act.\"\nC\n14. The Control Order was passed in exercise of power available under B¨\nthe Act. \"Export\" under the Foreign Trades Act involves several activities.\nIt includes transport, international contract between parties, interstate\nmovement and delivery to the buyer outside the country. The impugned\nclauses of the Control Order relate to certain restrictions on some parts of the\nactivities. By no stretch of imagination they can be considered to be opposed\nto the policy of export. The clauses are regulatory in nature and character\nwithout in any manner affecting the policy flowing from Section 5 of the\nForeign Trade Act. It is not that any unbridled and/or arbitrary power was\ngiven to the authorities as held by the High Court. In fact, the parameters of\nexercisable of power are inbuilt in Clause 10. Reasons were required to be\nrecorded. This was to be done objectively and not subjectively as appears D\nto have been concluded by the High Court. Looked at from any angle, the\nHigh Court's judgment is indefensible and is set aside.\nK.K.T.\n15. The appeal is allowed with no order as to costs.\nAppeal allowed. E\n"}
