They filed\nclassification list classifying the product under Central Excise Item No. 1503.10\nand claimed benefit of Notification No.262/86-CE. Department issued show\ncause notice on the appellants denying the benefit of the said Notification as E\nthey had not produced certificate as required under Clause (iii) of the said\nNotification.\nThe appellant then produced requisite certificate from the Directorate\nof Vanaspati, to the effect that vegetable oil was manufactured by Vijay Oil\nMill, and it had been manufactured from fixed vegetable oil extracted by\nsolvent method. Assistant Collector dropped the proceedings. Collector\n(Appeal) allowed the department's appeal. Appellants were unsuccessful in\ntheir appeal before the Tribunal. Hence the present appeal.\nDismissing the appeal, the Court\nHELD : 1. The Tribunal was right in holding that the appellants were\nnot entitled to benefit of Notification No. 262/86-CE.

Vijay Oil Mills would also not be entitled to the benefit of the\nNotification as they did not have a licence under the Central Excise Act and\nhad not complied with any of the formalities under the Central Excise Act.\nMore importantly they were not paying any excise duty. A party who\nadmittedly is not paying excise duty cannot claim exemption from duty.\n[695-C-D]\nCIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal Nos. 2523-2529\nof 2000.\nFrom the Judgment and Order dated 18.11.99 of the Central Excise,\nCustoms and Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal, New Delhi in F.O.

These Appeals are filed against an Order dated\n18th November, 1999 of the Customs, Excise and Gold (Control) Appellate\nTribunal (CEGAT).\nBriefly stated the facts are as follows.\nOn 26th of July 1988 one Vijay Oil Mill having its address at Majevadi\nGate, Junagadh, addressed a letter to the Superintendent of Central Excise,\nJunagadh, wherein it was mentioned that they had entered into a lease\nagreement with the Appellants. It was mentioned that Vijay Oil Mill was\nsupplying oil cakes to the factory of the Appellants and that the Appellants,\nH who are holding a valid Central Excise Licence, would be undertaking\n1\nVINAY SOLVENT EXTRACTION INDUSTRIES PVT. LTD. v. C.C.E. [variava, J.] 689\nmanufacturing activities for and on their behalf, i.e., on behalf of Vijay Oil A\nMill. The letter mentioned that the Vijay Oil Mill was accordingly filing a\ndeclaration under Notification No. 305/77 dated 5th November 1977. By the\nl√©tter Vijay Oil Mill applied for exemption from licencing control and for\npermitting the Appellants to discharge all the excise liabilities and procedural\nformalities on their behalf.\nThe declaration filed along with the letter is relevant and it reads as\nfollows :-\nB\n\"FCRM OF AUTHORISATION TO BE FILLED IN BY A\nMANUFACTURER WHO GETS HIS GOODS MANUFACTURED/\nFABRICATED FROM ANY OTHER PERSON AND TO BE C\nAGREED TO BY THE LATTER\nFrom: VIJAY OIL MILL\nFull Address Outside Majevadi,\nGate, JUNAGADH-362001\nD\nPhone No. if any: 25347/25397\nTo,\nThe Superintendent of Central Excise,\nRange JUNAGADH Division - Junagadh\nE\nAUTHORISATION\nF\nI/We, Vijay Oil Mill, Outside Majevadi Gate, Junagadh hereby\nauthorize M/s.

This Notification permits a manufacturer, who gets\nhis goods manufactured from some other person, to authorize that other\npersons i.e. the person who actually manufactures the goods, to comply with\nE the procedural formalities and discharge liabilities under the Central Excises\nF\nG\nH\nand Salt Act 1944. The declaration set out hereinabove clearly indicates that\nthe Appellants were the manufacturers. The Appellants have accepted the\nauthorization. They thus acknowledge that they are the actual manufacturer.\nIt must be mentioned that the parties also entered into a Lease Agreement\nwhich inter alia contained the following clauses :-\n\"1. Any type of oil cakes of your purchase and production will be\ntreated at the rate of Rs.500.00 per one Metric Ton of 1000 Kgs.\n2. The rates including the unloading of raw materials and the loading\nof the finished goods at our costs.\n3. You have to pay minimum charge if you are not able to give us\nthe sufficient raw materials to meet outstanding expenses whatsoever\naccrued during the year-on per year ending financial year.\n4. Oils, other than solvent extracted oils, will be charge for refining\n:\n1\nVINAY SOLVENT EXTRACTION INDUSTRIES PVT. LTD. v. C.C.E. [VARIAVA, J.] 691\nat Rs.700.00 per metric ton of oil.\"\nA\nThis Lease Agreement also indicates that the Appellants have leased\nout the factory to Vijay Oil Mill, who would supply the oil cakes to the\nAppellants and the Appellants would produce at the rate of Rs.500 per metric\nton of 1000 Kgs. (if the oil was a solvent extracted oil) and at the rate of\nRs.700 per metric ton (for other oils). The rates include unloading of raw B\nmaterial and loading of finished goods at the cost of the Appellants. Vijay Oil\nMills was to pay a minimum charge, which was to meet all standing expenses.\nThe Appellants filed a classification list classifying the product\nmanufactured by them under Tariff Sub-Heading 1503.10 of the Schedule to\nthe Central Excise Tariff Act 1985. In the classification list the Appellants\nclaimed benefit of Notification No. 262/86-C.E. dated 24th April 1986.\nC\nD\nSeven show-cause notices were issued to the Appellants on the ground\nthat they were not entitled to the benefit of the said Notification as they had\nnot produced certificates as required under clause (iii) of the said Notification.\nThe Appellants then produced certificates from the Directorate of Vanaspati,\nVegetable Oils and Fats to the effect that vegetable oil manufactured by\n\"Vijay Oil Mill\" had been manufactured from fixed vegetable oil extracted\nby solvent method. The Assistant Collector of Central Excise dropped the\nshow-cause notices on the production of the said certificates. He, however,\nimposed a penalty of Rs. 2,000 for non-filing of declaration under Notification E\nNo. 305/77-CE dated 5th November 1977.\nAgainst the dropping of the proceedings, the Department filed an Appeal\nto the Collector (Appeals). The Collector (Appeals) held that the Appellants\nwere not eligible for the exemption under Notification No. 262/86-CE dated\n24th April 1986.\nAgainst this Order the Appellants filed an Appeal to the Tribunal.\nThere was a difference of opinion between the Technical Member and the\nJudicial Member. The Judicial Member held that the Appellants were not\nentitled to the benefit of the Notification. The Technical Member held that\nthe Appellants were entitled to the benefit of the Notification. Because of the\ndifference of opinion the matter was referred to a third Member who agreed\nwith the view of the Judicial Member and held that the Appellants were not\nentitled to the benefit of the said Notification. Accordingly, by virtue of the\nmajority opinion, the Tribunal dismissed the Appeal and confirmed the\ndemands. Hence these Appeals.\nF\nG\nH\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n692\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2005] 3 S.C.R.\nThe question before this Court is whether the Appellants are entitled to\nbenefit of Notification No. 262/86-CE dated 24th April, 1986. Before this\nquestion is considered, for sake of clarity, facts need to be recapitulated\nbriefly. As set out above, Vijay Oil Mills had filed a declaration, which had\nbeen accepted by the Appellants, that the Appellants were the actual\nmanufacturers. The Department had accepted this case. The Central Excise\nlicence was held by the Appellants. The Appellants were the assessee who\nfiled the classification list (as manufacturers) and claimed the benefit of the\nNotification (as manufacturers).\nIt now becomes necessary to consider the Notification. It reads as\nfollows:-\n\"In exercise of the Powers conferred by sub-rule (1) of rule 8 of the\nCentral Excise Rules, 1944, the Central Government hereby exempts\nfixed vegetable oils falling under sub-heading No.1503.10 of the\nSchedule to the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985 (5 of 1986) (hereinafter\nreferred to as the said processed fixed vegetable oils) from the whole\nof the duty of excise leviable thereon which is specified in the said\nSchedule, subject to the following conditions, namely :-\n(i) the said processed fixed vegetable oil has been manufactured\nfrom fixed vegetable oils extracted by the solvent extraction\nmethod;\n(ii) the manufacturer shall maintain record regarding manufacture\nof the said processed fixed vegetable oils and their clearance\nin the manner specified by the Assistant Collector of Central\nExcise;\n(iii) the manufacturer shall within such period as the Assistant\nCollector of Central Excise may allow in this behalf produce\na certificate from an officer not below the rank of a Deputy\nDirector in the Directorate of Vanaspathi, Vegetable Oils\nand Fats to the effect that the said processed fixed Vegetable\noils have been manufactured from fixed vegetable oils\nextracted by the solvent extraction method; and\n(iv) the manufacturer undertakes to pay on demand in respect of\nsuch quantity of the said processed fixed vegetable oils as is\nnot proved to the satisfaction of the Assistant Collector\nof Central Excise to have been manufactured from fixed\n0\nI\n--1\n}\nVINAY SOLVENT EXTRACTION INDUSTRIES PVT. LTD. v. C.C.E. [VARIAVA, J.] 693\nvegetable oils extracted by solvent extraction method an A\namount equal to the duty of excise leviable thereon but\nfor the exemption contained herein.\"\nA plain reading of this Notification shows that the exemption is to the\nfixed vegetable oils falling under sub-heading 1503.10, provided (a) it has\nbeen manufactured from fixed vegetable oils extracted by the solvent extraction B\nmethod; (b) the manufacturer maintains record regarding manufacture of the\nsaid processed fixed vegetable oils and their clearance and (c) the manufacturer\nproduces a certificate from an officer not below the rank of a Deputy Director\nin the Directorate of Vanaspati, Vegetable Oils and Fats to the effect that the\nsaid processed fixed vegetable oils have been manufactured from fixed\nC\nvegetable oils extracted by the solvent extraction method. As seen above the\nAppellants are the manufacturers. They are maintaining the record and clearing\nthe goods. Under condition No. (iii), it is the Appellants who have to produce\nthe required certificate. The certificate must necessarily show that the processed\nfixed vegetable oils manufactured by the Appellants was manufactured from\nfixed vegetable oils extracted by the solvent extraction method. To get such D\na certificate the Appellants would have to be registered with the Directorate\nof Vansapati, Vegetable Oils and Fats, which admittedly the Appellants are\nnot. Realizing that this condition could not be fulfilled by them the Appellants\nproduced certificates certifying that Vijay Oil Mills had manufactured such\noil. As the Appellants are manufacturers such a certificate was of no help.\nThus before all the lower authorities including the Tribunal it was contended\nthat Vijay Oil Mills were the manufacturers. This was a case contrary to facts\nand the authorization and declaration. This contention was not accepted by\nthe Collector who rightly held that Vijay Oil Mills were getting the\nmanufacturing done by engaging the Appellants as job workers.\nIt must be mentioned that even in the Appeal Memo it has been\ncontended that Vijay Oil Mills are the manufacturers. Initially Mr.\nLakshmikumaran argued on the footing that Vijay Oil Mills were the\nmanufacturers. However, when the correct facts were noted, with this usual\nfairness, Mr. Lakshmikumaran admitted that the record depicted that Vijay\nOil Mills were not the manufacturers.\nE\nF.\nG\nMr. Lakshmikumaran has submitted that Condition No. (iii) only requires\na manufacturer, i.e. the Appellants, to produce a certificate to the effect that\nthe processed vegetable oil had been manufactured from fixed vegetable oils\nextracted by the solvent extraction method. He submitted that such certificates\nwere produced by the Appellants. He submitted that the Appellants were not H\n694\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2005] 3 S.C.R.\nA disentitled merely because the certificates mentioned that the fixed vegetable\noils were manufactured by Vijay Oil Mills. We see no substance in this\nsubmission. The required certificate must necessarily show that the oil\nmanufactured by the manufacturer (in this case the Appellants) had been\nmanufactured from fixed vegetable oils extracted by the solvent extraction\nmethod. The manufacturer producing a certificate that some other party had\nmanufactured processed oil from fixed vegetable oils extracted by solvent\nextraction method is obviously not sufficient.\nB\nC\nD\nFaced with this situation Mr. Lakshmikumaran submitted that the\nTribunal has given a categorical finding to the following effect :\n\"\nIn the instant case, it is nobody's contention that Vinay Oil\nhired Vijay Oil to manufacture on the former's account. On the\ncontrary, the entire factory was leased to Vijay Oil by an agreement\nwhich is on principal to principal basis. Except for receiving the lease\nfees, there is no other flow back of profits etc. to Vinay Oil shown\nbefore me. Therefore clearly, from the date of the lease, Vinay Oil\nceases to be the manufacturer and Vijay Oil becomes the manufacturer\nunder law. The undertaking given to ACCE that Vinay Oil would\nundertake to follow all excise procedures was misplaced in law as\nthere is no legal provision shown to me to prescribe this. Hence, it\nhas no value under this Act etc.\"\nE\nHe submitted that on this categorical finding the benefit of the\nNotification could not have been denied. He submitted that in view of this\nfinding the majority opinion to the effect that the benefit of the Notification\nwas not available is required to be set aside.\n:\nF\nG\nOn the other hand Mr. Doabia pointed out that confusion has been\npurposely created by the Appellants. He submitted that the case sought to be\nbuilt up was contrary to the documents on record. He submitted that the\nactual manufacturers were the Appellants. He submitted that as they were the\nactual manufacturers a Certificate in the name of Vijay Oil Mills would not\nentitle the Appellants to get the benefit of the Notification.\nWe have considered the rival submissions. It is clear that benefit of\nNotification No. 305/77-CE dated 5.11.1977 has been taken; the authorization\nand declaration given as the Appellants are manufacturing on job work basis\nfor Vijay Oil Mill. Thus, the actual manufacturer is the Appellant. It is the\nH Appellant who filed the classification list and cleared the goods. It was only\nI\nVINAY SOLVENT EXTRACTION INDUSTRIES PVT. LTD. v. C.C.E. [VARIAVA, J.] 695\nin reply to the show-cause notice that a contrary case was put up and confusion A\nsought to be created. If the Appellants are actual manufacturers they can only\nget benefit of the Notification provided they have certificates from the Deputy\nDirector of Vanaspati, Vegetable Oils and Fats showing that the vegetable oil\nproduced by them has been manufactured from fixed vegetable oils extracted\nby the solvent extraction method. The Appellants do not have any such\nB\ncertificates. Certificates showing that Vijay Oil Mills have processed fixed\nvegetable oils are not sufficient. The Appellants were aware of this position.\nThey thus contented that it was Vijay Oil Mill who manufactured the processed\noil. Such a contention is rightly not accepted by the Collector and even by\nthe Judicial Member. Undoubtedly, the third Member of the Tribunal appears\nto have accepted this case. However, it has been correctly held that Vijay Oil C\nMills would not be entitled to the benefit of the Notification as they do not\nhave a licence under the Central Excise Act and do not comply with any of\nthe formalities under the Central Excise Act. More importantly they are not\npaying any excise duty. A party who admittedly is not paying excise duty\ncannot claim exemption from duty.\nMr. Lakshmikumaran then submitted that as the facts were confusing\nthe matter should be remanded back to the Assessing Officer so that correct\nfacts could be ascertained. We are unable to accept this submission. The\nAppellants have accepted the authorization. They have shown themselves to\nD\nbe manufacturers. The Appellants are complying with the formalities under E\nthe Central Excise Act. The Appellants maintain the requisite records. The\nAppellants clear the goods. Condition No.(ii) of the Notification has been\ncomplied with by the Appellants and not by Vijay Oil Mill. It is the Appellants\nwho had filed the classification list. It is the Appellants who had claimed the\nbenefit of the said Notification. It can hardly now lie in the mouth of the\nAppellants to claim that Vijay Oil Mills were the real manufacturers. Further, F\nas stated above, even if Vijay Oil Mills were the manufacturer they would\nnot be entitled to the benefit of the Notification as they hold no licence nor\ncomply with formalities under the Central Excise Act. They do not even pay\nexcise duty. Thus no question arises of Vijay Oil Mills claiming benefit of\nthe said Notification.\nIn this view of the matter, we see no reason to interfere. The Appeals\nstand dismissed. There will, however, be no order as to costs.\nG\nD.G.\nAppeals dismissed.\n"}
