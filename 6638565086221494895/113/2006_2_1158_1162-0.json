Sharan, ASG, U.U. Lalit, Ravindra Keshavrao Adsure, Manish Tiwari, A\nShishir Pinaki, Amit Anand Tiwari, Ms. Sushma Suri and Vivek Sood for the\nRespondents.\nThe Order of the Court was delivered by\nB.P. SINGH, J.\nIn W.P. (Crl.) No. 17/2006:\nB\nIn this Writ Petition, the petitioner prays for issuance of a writ of\nmandamus quashing the order cancelling the Residence Visa Permit by order\ndated 7th October, 2005. He has also prayed for directions to the respondent C\nto produce the papers relating to grant of Indian citizenship to him by\nnaturalisation. He further prays that this Court may issue a writ of certiorari\nquashing and setting aside the oral direction or order of deportation passed\nby the respondents and allow the petitioner to enter the Indian territory.\nThe case of the petitioner is that he was born in India to parents who D\nE\nwere Iranian citizens. He was educated in India and thereafter intended to\nstay in India. He applied for grant of Indian passport on 15th July, 2003 in\nresponse whereto he was required to comply with certain formalities. It appears\nthat on the night intervening 7th/8th October, 2005, the petitioner was deported\nto Tehran. His grievance is that he was never informed as to why such action\nwas taken against him. Be that as it may, he applied again to the Indian\nEmbassy in Tehran to grant him entry visa enabling him to enter this country\nso that he could settle his pending matters in this country. According to the\npetitioner, he has been doing business in this country and, therefore, his\nsudden deportation has created complications for him, and it became absolutely\nnecessary for him to come to India to settle those matters. A Single Entry F\nPermit was issued to the petitioner by the Indian Embassy in Iran which was\nvalid for the period from 8th November, 2005 to 8th February, 2006. On that\nbasis, the petitioner has re-entered this country.\nThe petitioner states that he is being summoned to the Kurla Police\nG\nStation every day and is being unnecessarily harassed. His suspicion is that\nhe may again be deported in the same manner as was done on the last\noccasion without intimating him the reasons why he is sought to be deported\nand without giving him an opportunity of being heard.\nWe may observe that earlier, a Residential Permit was issued to the\nH\n1160\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2006] 2 S.C.R.\nA petitioner which has been extended from time to time and which stood\nextended till 3rd December, 2007. However, while deporting him, the\nauthorities cancelled the Residential Permit.\nThus, the factual position as of today is that the petitioner has entered\nthis country on the basis of a Single Entry Visa validity issued to him by the\nB Indian Embassy at Tehran. It is also stated that the fact that the petitioner had\nbeen deported from this country was mentioned in the application for grant\nof Entry Visa and that nothing was concealed.\nC\nThe question that arises for consideration is whether the authorities\nintend to deport him again and if so, whether they are obliged to disclose to\nthe petitioner the reasons for his proposed deportation.\nLearned counsel for the petitioner has relied upon a decision of this\nCourt reported in National Human Rights Commission v. State of Arunachal\nPradesh and Anr., [1996] | SCC 742 and particularly to the principles laid\nD down in paragraph 19 thereof and submitted that the petitioner cannot be\nthrown out of this country having regard to the fact that he was born in this\ncountry and lived here for many years and his application for grant of Indian\ncitizenship is still pending. It is not as if he has entered the territory of India\nstealthily with any ulterior objective and, therefore, it is only proper, even\nthough he is not an Indian citizen, that he should atleast be informed of the\nreasons why he is sought to be deported, and his representation if any in this\nregard considered. The learned Additional Solicitor General has fairly brought\nto our notice the principles laid down by this Court in Sarbananda Sonowal\nv. Union of India and Anr., [2005] 5 SCC 665. This Court in para 75 of the\nreport has observed as follows:\nE\nF\nG\nH\n\"Like the power to refuse admission this is regarded as an incident\nof the State's territorial sovereignty. International law does not prohibit\nthe expulsion en masse of aliens. (p. 351). Reference has also been\nmade to Article 13 of the International Covenant of 1966 on Civil\nand Political Rights which provides that an alien lawfully in the\nterritory of a State party to the Covenant may be expelled only pursuant\nto a decision reached by law, and except where compelling reasons\nof national security otherwise require, is to be allowed to submit the\nreasons against his expulsion and to have his case reviewed by and\nto be represented for the purpose before the competent authority. It\nis important to note that this Covenant of 1966 would apply provided\nan alien is lawfully in India, namely, with valid passport, visa, etc.\nHASAN ALI RAIHANY v. U.O.I [B.P. SINGH, J.]\n1161\nY\nand not to those who have entered illegally or unlawfully.\"\nA\nHaving regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, particularly,\nhaving regard to the fact that the petitioner has entered this country legally\nupon the Single Entry Permit issued to him, it is only fair that the competent\nauthority must inform him the reasons for his deportation. If such a decision\nis taken, the petitioner must be given an opportunity to submit his B\nrepresentation against his proposed expulsion. The competent authority may\nthereafter consider his representation and pass appropriate order. As observed\nby this Court, this procedure may be departed from for compelling reasons\nof national security etc. In the instant case, we have not so far noticed any\nfact which may provide a compelling reason for the State not to observe this\nC\nprocedure.\nWe, therefore, dispose of this writ petition with the directions to the\ncompetent authority, who we are told is the Deputy Commissioner of Police\nand FRRO, Mumbai, to communicate to the petitioner the reasons why he is\nsought to be deported from this country. The reasons disclosed must be D\nsufficient to enable the petitioner to make an effective representation, if he\nwishes to do so. The petitioner shall be given two weeks' time to make a\nrepresentation which shall be considered by the competent authority as soon\nas possible. Any order passed shall be communicated to the petitioner\nforthwith.\nWe further direct that the petitioner shall continue to report at the Kurla\nPolice Station every day. It is stated by learned counsel appearing on his\nbehalf that the present residential address of the petitioner is the following:\nE\nHasan Ali Raihany,\nDeeraj Apartments,\n'C' Wing, Flat No. 303,\nF\nShastri Nagar,\nSantacruz (West),\nMumbai.\nIf there is any change of address, the petitioner will inform the Kurla Police\nStation of the said change. He shall continue to report to the Police Station\ntill such time as the competent authority passes appropriate order as directed.\nIn case an adverse order is passed against the petitioner, it shall not be\n0\nH\n1162\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2006] 2 S.C.R.\nA given effect for a period of seven days from the date of service of that order\non the petitioner so that he may seek appropriate legal remedy, if so advised.\nB\nThe writ petition is disposed of accordingly.\nCrl. M.P No. 2098/2006 in and S.L.P. (Crl.) No....../2006:\nPermission to file S.L.P. is granted.\nIn view of the disposal of Writ Petition (Crl.) No. 17/2006, the special\nleave petition has become infructuous and the same is dismissed as such.\nC R.P.\nWrit Petition disposed of,\nSpecial Leave Petition dismissed.\n"}
