The contention that the fifth respondent was biased has been\nraised only in 'the grounds' of the writ petition and the contents thereof have\nnot been verified. In the grounds of a writ petition only a question of law can\nbe raised and not a statement of fact. No statement has been made in the body\nC of the writ petition. The statement made in the said grounds was also not\nverified in accordance with the writ rules. Besides, the fifth respondent in\nhis affidavit denied and disputed the contents thereof. Whether the statement\nof the appellant or the fifth respondent was correct or not could not ordinarily\nbe decided in a writ proceeding. It is well known that in a writ petition\nordinarily such a disputed question of fact should not be entertained. The High\nCourt has rightly arrived at a finding of fact on the basis of affidavit evidence.\n[565-E-F]\nᎠ\nE\nF\n2. Having regard to the findings of fact arrived at by the High Court the\ncontention of the appellants that the Line Officer should have made entry in\nthe register in terms of Rule 22.55 of the Punjab Police Rules, 1934 is wholly\nmisconceived. If the appellant had taken back his application for withdrawal\nof resignation after submitting the same to the Lines Officer, the question of\nmaking any entry thereabout in the register would not arise. Besides, plea of\nalleged non-compliance of the said rule relating to maintenance of records\nhas not been raised by the appellant either in the writ petition or in the special\nleave petition. Such a question admittedly was also not raised at the hearing\nbefore the High Court. Therefore, the appellant cannot be permitted to raise\nthe said contention before this Court for the first time. [565-B-C]\n3. Furthermore, as has been rightly held by the High Court, the\nappellant was not entitled to any relief in view of his conduct as he suppressed\nG material facts.

STATE OF HARYANA [SINHA, J.]\n559\nA\nfor the Appellant.\nAjay Siwach, Sandeep Sharma, Pradeep Dahiya and T.V. George for the\nRespondents.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nS.B. SINHA, J. This appeal is directed against a judgment and order\ndated 14.07.2003 passed by the High Court of Punjab \u0026 Haryana in CWP\nNo.14261 of 2000 dismissing the writ petition filed by the Appellant herein\nquestioning an order dated 24.08.2000 by reason whereof his offer for voluntary\nretirement was accepted.\nB\nC\nThe Appellant was appointed as a Constable in Haryana Police. In 1992,\nhe was promoted as Head Constable. He allegedly had been on unauthorized\nleave. The Station House Officer made a report to the superiors about his\nbehaviour and conduct. He was placed under suspension, whereafter a\ndepartmental proceeding was initiated against him. During the pendency of\nthe said enquiry, according to the Appellant, when he was called to the office D\nof the Superintendent of Police on 29.05.2000, filed an application wherein he,\ninter alia, expressed his intention to go for voluntary retirement with effect\nfrom 31.08.2000 in the following terms:\n“Most respectfully I want to bring in your kind notice that on\n19.8.1999 at about 9 P.M. I received an VT on wireless set from E\nprevious worthy S.P. Shri O.P. Singh IPS Hisar that, three unknown\nculprits covering their mouth riding on an matiyala scooter round up\nthese.\n2.

That above culprits come on above scooter towards ply over\nthe turned in sector 13A Hisar Shopping Center I covered these in\nSector 13 while running behind these might right leg gone in sewerage\ndip and I got fracture.\n4. That on 19.8.99 I was admitted in G.H. Hisar remained in G.H.\nHisar up to 4.10.1999 and got 15% disability on 1.3.2000. I am still\nunder treatment.\n5. That now I feel lackness in my right leg and now I want to go\non retirement from 31.08.2000.\"\nF\nG\nH\nA\nB\n560\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2006] 2 S.C.R.\nAllegedly, thereafter he was absolved of the charges framed against him\nin the departmental proceedings. He despite reinstatement in service allegedly\nwas not allowed to perform any duty. Indisputably, by an order dated\n24.08.2000, the offer of the Appellant for voluntary retirement was accepted,\nwhich reads thus:\n\"HC Himmat Singh No.852/HSR is hereby permitted to proceed on\nvoluntary retirement w.e.f. 31.8.2000 A.N. i.e. after the expiry of notice\nperiod.\"\nThe Appellant, however, contends that he had withdrawn the said offer\non 24.08.2000 itself by filing an application which was forwarded to the\nC Superintendent of Police by the Lines Officer, Police Lines, Hisar.\nD\nE\nF\nThe Appellant filed a writ petition before the Punjab and Haryana High\nCourt praying, inter alia, for the following reliefs :\n\"(i) issue a writ in the nature of certiorari calling for the records\nof the respondents concerning the passing of the order retiring the\npetitioner and after perusal of the same, order retiring the petitioner\nbe quashed and the petitioner be allowed to continue in service.\n(ii) it is further prayed that an application which the petitioner\nsent through Line Officer who has forwarded to the Supdt. Of Police\non 24.08.2000 be allowed with all consequential reliefs and the petitioner\nbe allowed to continue in service till the age of superannuation.\"\nA Division Bench of the High Court before issuing rule nisi went\nthrough the records and opined that the contention raised by the Appellant\nthat he had withdrawn the offer of voluntary retirement on 24.08.2000 may be\ncorrect. Pursuant to a direction issued by a Division Bench of the said court,\nthe then Superintendent of Police as also the Lines Officer affirmed their\nrespective affidavits.\nWe may furthermore notice that the Appellant in the writ petition raised\na serious allegation that he had been assaulted by the Fifth Respondent on\nG 24.08.2000, who forcibly obtained an acknowledgment from him on the order\nof retirement although no copy thereof was handed over to him. He while\nacknowledging the same made the following endorsements therein:\n\"Sir,\nNoted and application already for withdrawal/cancellation sent to\nH\nt\nIF\nHIMMAT SINGH v. STATE OF HARYANA [SINHA, J.]\n561\n7\nyour office today.\nA\nSd/- Himmat Singh, HC/SJL\nP.S. HSR. 24.8.2000\"\nThe said allegation of the Appellant had specifically been denied and\ndisputed by the Fifth Respondent in his aforementioned affidavit in the\nfollowing terms:\n\"That in the order dated 18/24.8.2000, the deponent specifically\nmentioned that the petitioner would be permitted to proceed on\nvoluntary retirement w.e.f. 31.8.2000 i.e. after the expiry of the notice\nperiod, therefore, the deponent was very well aware of the fact that\nas per the provisions of the Rules the application of the petitioner for\nseeking voluntary retirement could be allowed after the expiry of the\nnotice period.\"\nIt was further pointed out :\nB\nC\nD\n\"That some of the above-mentioned facts and circumstances and\norders passed by the deponent in the case of the petitioner have\ndeliberately been not brought on record by the petitioner to suppress\nthe material facts from this Hon'ble Court and with a view to play\nfraud upon the Court. The story of the petitioner is totally belied from E\nthe fact that he has himself sworn an affidavit duly signed by him,\ndated 1.9.2000, that he has proceeded on voluntary retirement, whereas\nin the present writ petition his own case is that he had made an\napplication on 24.8.2000 for withdrawal of the voluntary retirement. It\nhas been further mentioned by the petitioner that his letter dated\n24.8.2000 was signed by the Line Officer, Police Lines, Hisar. It is F\nrespectfully submitted that though the records pertaining to the present\ncase have been kept in the custody of this Hon'ble Court and the\nalleged application dated 24.8.2000 is almost 2 years 9 months old, the\ndeponent most humbly submit from his memory that he has never\nreceived such an application dated 24.8.2000 from the petitioner in\nperson. In fact, had the petitioner made any such application he would\nhave never sworn the affidavit dated 1.9.2000 and would have at least\nmade a mention or in the alternative would have made a mention of\nthe said application dated 24.8.2000 in the said affidavit. Had the\nalleged application dated 24.8.2000 been presented by the petitioner\nto the competent authority i.e. the deponent, there was no reason for H\nG\n562\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2006] 2 S.C.R.\nthe deponent to not consider the same because in the order dated 18/\n24.8.2000 passed by the deponent it was clearly indicated that the\nvoluntary retirement of the petitioner would come into effect w.e.f.\n31.8.2000 i.e. after the period of the notice period.\"\nIt had further been averred :\n\"...In fact, it seems that the petitioner has deliberately tried to mislead\nthis Hon'ble Court by not only casting very serious allegations of\nmala fide against the deponent but also not producing before this\nHon'ble Court relevant orders passed by the competent authority i.e.\nthe deponent and other material facts such as the affidavit of the\npetitioner dated 1.9.2000. it seems that the allegations of malafide\nagainst the deponent do not originate from the facts verified by the\npetitioner but may have originated from the improper legal advice\ngiven to him in as much as there as not only been a deliberate attempt\non behalf of the petitioner to suppress material facts and circumstances,\nthe petitioner may also have been fully aware of the fact that if true\nfacts are brought to the notice of the Court, the petition filed by the\npetitioner may not have been entertained. To prejudice the mind of\nthis Hon'ble Court, therefore, the petitioner has chosen a very novel\nmethod i.e. firstly to make material suppression of facts and play fraud\nupon this Hon'ble Court and secondly to allege malafides against the\ndeponent to prove his case. It is clear that the allegation of malafide\nhave not originated from the actual facts and circumstances.”\nThe Lines Officer pursuant to the said directions affirmed an affidavit\nbefore the High Court stating:\n\"1. That I was working as Lines Officer, Police Lines, Hisar on\n29.5.2000. An application for seeking retirement w.e.f. 31.8.2000 was\nsubmitted by HC Himat Singh (Petitioner) which was forwarded by the\ndeponent on the very same day and handed over to the petitioner on\nhis request which was submitted by him personally before the then\nSuperintendent of Police, Hisar-Sh. Sandeep Khirwar, I.P.S.\n2. That similarly an application for cancellation of voluntary\nretirement dated 24.8.2000 addressed to the Superintendent of Police\nHisar as put up before me by the petitioner and the same was also\nforwarded and handed over to petitioner by me on his personal\nrequest on the same day.\"\nHIMMAT SINGH v. STATE OF HARYANA [SINHA, J.]\n563\nThe High Court on consideration of the entire matter was of the opinion A\nthat the contentions of the Respondents are correct holding:\n\"...it is not possible for us to record a finding of fact that the petitioner\nactually communicated the application dated 24.8.2000 withdrawing\nthe request for retirement to the Lines Officer, Police Lines, Hisar, for\nonward communication to the Superintendent of Police, Hisar...\"\nB\nUpon taking into consideration the affidavit affirmed by the Appellant\non 01.09.2000 wherein he categorically stated that he had requested to proceed\non voluntary retirement w.e.f. 31.08.2000, the High Court opined :\nD\n\"On the basis of the aforesaid affidavit submitted by the petitioner, C\nit is contended that the petitioner has concocted a story so as to get\nout of his earlier request for voluntary retirement. The original of the\naforesaid affidavit has been produced in Court along with the official\nrecord. It reveals that the stamp paper on which the affidavit was\nsubmitted was purchased from the stamp vendor by the petitioner\nhimself. The aforesaid affidavit was duly notarized by a notary public.\nThe particulars of the notary public, reveal his identity as Sh. Ram\nSwaroop Singh Dhanda, Advocate, Hisar, Learned counsel for the\npetitioner could not dispute the purchase of the stamp paper on which\nthe affidavit has been sworn, or the submission of the aforesaid\naffidavit by the petitioner himself If the petitioner actually executed E\nthe aforesaid affidavit (which has also been attached to the written\nstatement as Annexure R-3), and submitted it to the authorities for\nconsideration, there can hardly be any doubt that the petitioner ever\nwithdrew his request for voluntary retirement. In fact the aforesaid\nfactual position demonstrates that the petitioner has maneuvered\nofficial record to project an incorrect factual position so as to obtain\na favourable order from us.\"\nThe High Court also rejected the contention of the Appellant that he\nhad been coerced to apply for voluntary retirement.\nF\nG\nMr. Mahabir Singh, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the\nAppellant, would submit that having regard to the fact that the Lines Officer,\nHisar, had clearly stated in the affidavit that the letter of withdrawal of the\noffer of voluntary retirement had been handed over to him, it was his duty\nto make an entry therefor in the requisite register in terms of clause 12.55 of\nthe Punjab Police Rules, 1934. He was furthermore in accordance with the said H\n564\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2006] 2 S.C.R.\nA rules required to make an entry thereof, in the appropriate register showing\nthat the same had been taken back by the Appellant. The said rule reads thus:\nB\nC\nD\n\"22.55. Register No. V. -The correspondence register shall be\nmaintained in two parts in Form 22.55. Each part shall contain 400\npages.\n(1) In Part I shall be entered a brief abstract of all reports and\norders received at the police station and of all letters and replies\ndispatched which are not entered in any other book.\n(2) When any entry is made in the receipt columns the\ncorresponding dispatch column shall be left blank for the reply and\nvice versa.\nThis register is a receipt and dispatch register and is not meant\nas a record of the full correspondence. Correspondence received and\nnot meant to be forwarded or returned shall be filed in monthly files.\nThese shall be destroyed after two years.\n(3) In Part II the receipt and return of processes shall be entered.\nProcesses include\n(a) Summonses to appear or to produce.\nE\n(b)\nWarrants of arrests.\n(c)\nSearch warrants\nF\nG\nH\n(d) Orders of proclamation, attachment, injunction or otherwise under\nsections 87, 88, 95, 99, 133, 140, 143, 144 and 145, Code of Criminal\nProcedure.\nWarrants in all non-cognizable criminal cases and summonses in\nnon-cognizable criminal cases in which Government is the complainant\nare served through the police.\nOn the last day in each month a statement giving the following\ninformation shall be entered in the daily diary and sidelined in red ink:-\n(a)\nThe number of warrants remaining un-executed at the end of the\nprevious month, received and executed during the current month\nand remaining unexecuted at the end of it.\n(b) Similar information regarding summonses in cognizable and non-\nHIMMAT SINGH v. STATE OF HARYANA [SINHA, J.]\ncognizable cases.\n(c) Similar information regarding other processes.\n565\nA\nAt the end of the year any statistics required shall be compiled\nfrom such entries in the daily diary.\"\nHaving regard to the findings of fact arrived at by the High Court, we B\nare of the opinion that the said contention is wholly misconceived. If the\nAppellant had taken back his application for withdrawal of resignation after\nsubmitting the same to the Lines Officer; the question of making any entry\nthereabout in the register would not arise. Alleged non compliance of the said\nrule relating to maintenance of records furthermore has not been raised by the\nAppellant either in the writ petition or in the special leave petition. Such C\nquestion admittedly was also not raised at the hearing before the High Court.\nWe, therefore, cannot permit the Appellant to raise the said contention before\nus for the first time.\na\nMr. Mahabir Singh then contended that the High Court did not deal\nwith the averments made in the writ petition that the Fifth Respondent was Ꭰ\nbiased and in this connection our attention was drawn to ground no.7 of the\nwrit petition.\nThe said contention again has no force. Such a contention has been\nraised only in 'the grounds' and the contents thereof have not been verified.\nIn the grounds of a writ petition only a question of law can be raised and E\nnot a statement of fact. No statement has been made in the body of the writ\npetition. The statement made in the said grounds was also not verified in\naccordance with the writ rules. Despite the same, as we have noticed\nhereinbefore, the Fifth Respondent in his affidavit denied or disputed the\ncontents thereof. Whether the statement of the Appellant or the Fifth\nRespondent was correct or not could not ordinarily be decided in a writ\nproceeding. It is well known that in a writ petition ordinarily such a disputed\nquestion of fact should not be entertained. The High Court arrived at a\nfinding of fact on the basis of affidavit evidence.\nF\nWe agree with the said findings of the High Court. Furthermore, as has G\nbeen rightly held by the High Court, that the Appellant was not entitled to\nany relief in view of his conduct as he suppressed material facts.\nFor the reasons aforementioned, we do not find any merit in this appeal,\nwhich is dismissed accordingly with costs. Counsel's fee assessed at Rs. 10,000.\nR.P.\nAppeal dismissed.\nH\nL\n"}
