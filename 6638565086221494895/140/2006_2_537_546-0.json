Grih\nNirman Mandal Adhiniyam, 1972. Respondent was appointed by\nAppellant as a daily wager.\nThe questions which arose for consideration in the present appeal\nare 1) whether Respondent could be accorded permanent status though\nhe was not appointed on any vacant post duly sanctioned by the statutory\nauthority nor his appointment was made upon following the statutory law\noperating in the field and 2) whether Respondent derived a legal right to\nbe regularised in service merely because he had worked for more than\n240 days.\nAllowing the appeal, the Court\nE\nF\nHELD: 1.1. A person with a view to obtain the status of a 'permanent G\nemployee must be appointed in terms of the statutory rules. It is not the\ncase of the Respondent that he was appointed against a vacant post which\nwas duly sanctioned by the statutory authority or his appointment was\nmade upon following the statutory law operating in the field. The Labour\n537\nH\n538\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2006] 2 S.C.R.\nA Court unfortunately did not advert to the said question and proceeded to\npass its award on the premise that as the Respondent had worked for more\nthan six months satisfactorily; in terms of clause 2(i) of the Standard\nStanding Orders made under the Madhya Pradesh Industrial Employment\n(Standing Orders) Act, 1961, he acquired the right of becoming permanent.\nFor arriving at the said conclusion, the Labour Court relied only upon\nB\nthe oral statement made by the Respondent. [541-F-H; 542-A]\n1.2. It is one thing to say that a person was appointed on an ad-hoc\nbasis or as a daily wager but it is another thing to say that he is appointed\nin a sanctioned post which was lying vacant upon following the due\nC procedure prescribed therefor. It has not been found by the Labour Court\nthat the Respondent was appointed by the Appellant, which is a 'State'\nwithin the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution of India, upon\ncompliance of the constitutional requirements as also the provisions of the\nM.P.

SINHA, J. Leave granted.\nE\nThe Respondent was appointed on daily wages as a Sub-Engineer (Civil)\non or about 7.4.1995. On the premise that his services may be terminated, he F\nfiled a writ petition whereupon by an order dated 25.4.2000, the High Court\ndirected the Appellant-Board to consider his case in the light of the purported\ncirculars issued by the State Government for scrutiny of the daily rated\nemployees. Upon the said direction, a scrutiny committee was appointed\nwhich found that there had been no vacancy nor there existed\nany sanctioned\nG\npost. The Committee prior to coming to the aforementioned opinion gave an\nopportunity of hearing to the Respondent. He thereafter filed an application\nbefore the Labour Court purported to be in terms of Section 31(3) read with\nSection 64-A of the Madhya Pradesh Industrial Relations Act, 1960 (for short\n“the 1960 Act”) praying that he be classified in the permanent category on\nH\n540\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2006] 2 S.C.R.\nA the ground that he had satisfactorily worked for more than six months and,\nthus, became eligible therefor as provided under Clause 2(i) of the Standard\nStanding Orders. The Labour Court by an order dated 22.1.2002 allowed the\nsaid application holding:\nB\nC\nD\nE\n\"According to the discussion of issue No. 1 and 2 it has been decided\nthat the applicant is entitled to be categorized in the permanent category\non the post of Sub-Engineer (Civil). Hence the non-applicant is ordered\nfrom the date of submitting the application of applicant in this Court\nfrom 10.5.2005 2 years prior from it the applicant be categorized in\npermanent category.\nBecause the applicant had been appointed in daily wages hence in the\ncircumstances of the case and I do not consider it proper to give\nbenefit of salary of a permanent category to the applicant. But, the\napplicant is entitled to claim pay scale of permanent category from\n10.5.2000 the date of submitting application before this Court.\"\nAn appeal was preferred thereagainst by the Appellants before the\nIndustrial Court, Jabalpur and by an order dated 16.10.2003, the same was\ndismissed. A writ petition filed by the Appellant was also dismissed. By\nreason of the impugned judgment, the Letters Patent Appeal filed by the\nAppellant has also been dismissed.\nMr. B.S. Banthia, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Appellants\nsubmitted that the Respondent having been appointed as a daily wager, he\ncould not have been declared as a permanent employee as there existed no\nclear vacancy. It was further submitted that only because the Respondent had\nworked for more than 240 days by itself could not have been a ground for\nF issuance of a direction for the regularization in the service.\nMr. T.G. Narayanan Nair, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf\nof the Respondent, on the other hand would draw our attention to a recent\ndecision of a Division Bench of this Court in State of Madhya Pradesh and\nOrs. v. Onkar Prasad Patel, (2005) 10 SCALE 153 and on the basis thereof\nG submitted that, in view of the definition of ‘permanent employee' as also\nH\n'temporary employee', the appointment of the Respondent would come within\nthe purview thereof and, thus, on his completion of six months satisfactory\nservice, he would be entitled to either a temporary status or a permanent\nstatus.\ni\nT\nฟัง\n+\nM.P. HOUSING BOARD v. MANOJ SHRIVASTAVA [SINHA, J.]\n541\nThe Appellant-Board was constituted under M.P. Grih Nirman Mandal A\nAdhiniyam, 1972 (‘1972 Act'). Indisputably, the terms and conditions of\nemployment of its employees are governed by a statute. The State of Madhya\nPradesh enacted the M.P. Industrial Relations Act, 1960 with a view to regulate\nthe relations of employers and employees in certain matters, to make provisions\nfor settlement of industrial disputes and to provide for matters connected\ntherewith. In the year 1961, the State of Madhya Pradesh also enacted the\nMadhya Pradesh Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act, 1961 (for\nshort \"the 1961 Act\") to provide for rules defining with sufficient precision\ncertain matters relating to the conditions of employment of employees in the\nState of Madhya Pradesh.\n'Permanent employee' and 'temporary employee' have been defined in\nClauses 2(i) and (vi) of Standard Standing Order made under 1961 Act which\nread as under:\nB\nC\n\"(i) A 'permanent' employee is one who has completed six months'\nsatisfactory service in a clear vacancy in one or more posts whether D\nas a probationer or otherwise, or a person whose name has been\nentered in the muster roll and who is given a ticket of permanent\nemployee;\n(vi) 'temporary employee' means an employee who has been employed\nfor work which is essentially of a temporary character, or who is E\ntemporarily employed as an additional employee in connection with\nthe temporary increase in the work of a permanent nature; provided\nthat in case such employee is required to work continuously for more\nthan six months he shall be deemed to be a permanent employee,\nwithin the meaning of Clause (i) above.\"\nA person with a view to obtain the status of a 'permanent employee'\nmust be appointed in terms of the statutory rules. It is not the case of the\nRespondent that he was appointed against a vacant post which was duly\nsanctioned by the statutory authority or his appointment was made upon\nfollowing the statutory law operating in the field.\nF\nG\nThe Labour Court unfortunately did not advert to the said question and\nproceeded to pass its award on the premise that as the Respondent had worked\nfor more than six months satisfactorily; in terms of clause 2(i) of the Standard\nStanding Order, he acquired the right of becoming permanent. For arriving\nat the said conclusion, the Labour Court relied only upon the oral statement H\n542\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2006] 2 S.C.R.\nA made by the Respondent.\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nIt is one thing to say that a person was appointed on an ad-hoc basis\nor as a daily wager but it is another thing to say that he is appointed in a\nsanctioned post which was lying vacant upon following the due procedure\nfreedom prescribed therefor.\nIt has not been found by the Labour Court that the Respondent was\nappointed by the Appellant herein, which is a 'State' within the meaning of\nArticle 12 of the Constitution of India, upon compliance of the constitutional\nrequirements as also the provisions of the 1972 Act or the rules and regulations\nframed thereunder.\nIn Mahendra L. Jain and Ors. v. Indore Development Authority and\nOrs. [2005] | SCC 639, this Court followed an earlier decision of this Court\nin M.P. Vidyut Karamchari Sangh v. M.P. Electricity Board, [2004] 9 SCC\n755 wherein it was clearly held that when two statutory rules operate in the\nfield unless the rules and regulations framed by the statutory authority are\ninconsistent with the provisions of the 1960 Act and the Rules framed\nthereunder, provisions of both the statute are required to be followed, holding\n:\n\"\n‘... The 1973 Act or the Rules framed thereunder do not provide for\nappointments on ad hoc basis or on daily wages. The 1961 Act itself\nshows that the employees are to be classified in six categories, namely,\npermanent, permanent seasonal, probationers, badlies, apprentices and\ntemporary. The recruitments of the appellants do not fall in any of the\nsaid categories. With a view to become eligible to be considered as\na permanent employee or a temporary employee, one must be\nappointed in terms thereof. Permanent employee has been divided in\ntwo categories (i) who had been appointed against a clear vacancy in\none or more posts as probationers and otherwise; and (ii) whose\nname had been registered both at muster roll and who has been given\na ticket of permanent employee. A \"ticket of permanent employee\"\nwas, thus, required to be issued in terms of Order 3 of the Standard\nStanding Orders. Grant of such ticket was imperative before\npermanency could be so claimed. The appellants have not produced\nany such ticket.\"\nIt was further held:\nM.P. HOUSING BOARD v. MANOJ SHRIVASTAVA [SINHA. J.] 543\nB\n\"The Standing Orders governing the terms and conditions of service A\nmust be read subject to the constitutional limitations wherever\napplicable. Constitution being the suprema lex, shall prevail over all\nother statutes. The only provision as regards recruitment of the\nemployees is contained in Order 4 which merely provides that the\nmanager shall within a period of six months, lay down the procedure\nfor recruitment of employees and notify it on the notice board on\nwhich Standing Orders are exhibited and shall send copy thereof to\nthe Labour Commissioner. The matter relating to recruitment is\ngoverned by the 1973 Act and the 1987 Rules. In the absence of any\nspecific directions contained in the Schedule appended to the Standing\nOrders, the statute and the statutory rules applicable to the employees C\nof the respondent shall prevail.\"\nIt was furthermore held:\n\"For the purpose of this matter, we would proceed on the basis that\nthe 1961 Act is a special statute vis-a-vis the 1973 Act and the Rules D\nframed thereunder. But in the absence of any conflict in the provisions\nof the said Act, the conditions of service including those relating to\nrecruitment as provided for in the 1973 Act and the 1987 Rules\nwould apply. If by reason of the latter, the appointment is invalid, the\nsame cannot be validated by taking recourse to regularisation. For the\npurpose of regularisation which would confer on the employee E\nconcerned a permanent status, there must exist a post. However, we\nmay hasten to add that regularisation itself does not imply permanency.\nWe have used the term keeping in view the provisions of the 1963\nRules.\"\nA daily wager does not hold a post unless he is appointed in terms of\nthe Act and the rules framed thereunder. He does not derive any legal right\nin relation thereto.\nThe effect of such an appointment recently came up for consideration\nin State of U.P. v. Neeraj Awasthi and Ors., [2006] 1 SCC 667 wherein this\nCourt clearly held that such appointments are illegal and void. It was further\nheld:\n\"The fact that all appointments have been made without following\nthe procedure or services of some persons appointed have been\nregularised in past, in our opinion, cannot be said to be a normal\nF\nG\nH\n544\nA\nB\nC\nᎠ\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2006] 2 S.C.R.\nmode which must receive the seal of the court. Past practice is not\nalways the best practice. If illegality has been committed in the past,\nit is beyond comprehension as to how such illegality can be allowed\nto perpetuate. The State and the Board were bound to take steps in\naccordance with law. Even in this behalf Article 14 of the Constitution\nof India will have no application. Article 14 has a positive concept.\nNo equality can be claimed in illegality is now well-settled. [See\nState of A.P. v. S.B.P.V. Chalapathi Rao and Ors., [1995] | SCC\n724, para 8, Jalandhar Improvement Trust v. Sampuran Singh, [1999]\n3 SCC 494, para 13 and State of Bihar and Ors. v. Kameshwar\nPrasad Singh and Anr., [2000] 9 SCC 94, para 30].\nIn the instant case, furthermore, no post was sanctioned. It is now\nwell-settled when a post is not sanctioned, normally, directions for\nreinstatement should not be issued. Even if some posts were available,\nit is for the Board or the Market Committee to fill-up the same in\nterms of the existing rules. They, having regard to the provisions of\nthe regulations, may not fill up all the posts.\"\nIt is now well-settled that only because a person had been working for\nmore than 240 days, he does not derive any legal right to be regularized in\nservice. [See Madhyamik Shiksha Parishad, U.P. v. Anil Kumar Mishra and\nOrs., [2005] 5 SCC 122, Executive Engineer, ZP Engg. Divn. And Anr. v.\nE Digambara Rao and Ors., [2004] 8 SCC 262, Dhampur Sugar Mills Ltd. v.\nBhola Singh, [2005] 2 SCC 470, Manager, Reserve Bank of India, Bangalore\nv. S. Mani and Ors., [2005] 5 SCC 100 and Neeraj Awasthi (supra)]\nF\nG\nH\nIn State of Karnataka \u0026 Ors. v. KGSD Canteen Employees Welfare\nAssociation \u0026 Ors., (2006) 1 SCALE 85 it was held:\n\"The question which now arises for consideration is as to whether\nthe High Court was justified in directing regularization of the services\nof the Respondents. It was evidently not. In a large number of\ndecisions, this Court has categorically held that it is not open to a\nHigh Court to exercise its discretion under Article 226 of the\nConstitution of India either to frame a scheme by itself or to direct\nthe State to frame a scheme for regularising the services of ad hoc\nemployees or daily wages employees who had not been appointed in\nterms of the extant service rules framed either under a statute or\nunder the proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution of India. Such a\nscheme, even if framed by the State, would not meet the requirements\nY\nM.P. HOUSING BOARD v. MANOJ SHRIVASTAVA [SINHA. J.] 545\nB\nof law as the executive order made under Article 162 of the A\nConstitution of India cannot prevail over a statute or statutory rules\nframed under proviso to Article 309 thereof. The State is obligated to\nmake appointments only in fulfilment of its constitutional obligation\nas laid down in Articles 14, 15 and 16 of the Constitution of India\nand not by way of any regularization scheme. In our constitutional\nschemes, all eligible persons similarly situated must be given\nopportunity to apply for and receive considerations for appointments\nat the hands of the authorities of the State. Denial of such a claim by\nsome officers of the State times and again had been deprecated by\nthis Court. In any view, in our democratic polity, an authority\nhowsoever high it may be cannot act in breach of an existing statute C\nor the rules which hold the field.\"\nThe appointment made by a person who has no authority therefor would\nbe void. A fortiori an appointment made in violation of the mandatory\nprovisions of the statute or constitutional obligation shall also be void. If no\nappointment could be made in terms of the statute, such appointment being D\nnot within the purview of the provisions of the Act would be void; he cannot\nbe brought within the cadre of permanent employees. The definitions of\n'permanent employee' and 'temporary employee' as contained in the rules.\nmust, thus, be construed having regard to the object and purport sought to be\nachieved by the Act.\nIn State of Punjab v. Jagdip Singh \u0026 Ors., [1964] 4 SCR 964, a\nConstitution Bench of this Court held that if no post was available at the time\nwhen the respondent therein could be confirmed, such appointment would be\nvoid. The effect of such void appointment has been held to be conferring no\nlegal right stating :\nE\nF\n\"...When an order is void on the ground that the authority which\nmade it had no power to make it cannot give rise to any legal rights,\nand as suggested by the learned Advocate-General, any person could\nhave challenged the status of the respondents as Tahsildars by\ninstituting proceedings for the issue of a writ of quo warranto under G\nArticle 226 of the Constitution. Had such proceedings been taken it\nwould not have been possible for the respondents to justify their\nstatus as permanent Tahsildars and the High Court would have issued\na writ of quo warranto depriving the respondents of their status as\npermanent Tahsildars” .\nH\n546\nA\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2006] 2 S.C.R.\n[See also Union Public Service Commission v. Girish Jayanti Lal\nVaghela \u0026 Ors., (2006) 2 SCALE 115].\nIn Onkar Prasad Patel (supra), whereupon Mr. Nair placed strong\nreliance, it was categorically held that an employee would not come within\nthe purview of definition of permanent employee' only because he has\nB completed six months' satisfactory service. The other requirement was that\nthe service must be rendered in a clear vacancy in one or more posts which\nwas established. The conditions were held to be cumulative and not\nindependent of each other. The said decision, therefore, runs counter to the\nsubmission of the learned counsel.\nC\nFor the foregoing reasons, the impugned judgment cannot be sustained\nwhich is set aside accordingly. The appeal is allowed. The order of the\nLabour Court will stand set aside. However, in the facts and circumstance of\nthe case, there shall be no order as to costs.\nD\nB.B.B.\nAppeal allowed.\n"}
