UNION OF INDIA \u0026 1143\nORS. [SWATANTER KUMAR, J.]\nB\nsome cases, where the jurisdiction is invoked to protect the A\nfundamental rights and their enjoyment within the limitation of\nlaw, the Court has even stepped in to pass orders which may\nhave the colour of legislation, till an appropriate legislation is\nput in place. The directions of the Court could be relatable to\na particular lis between the parties and even could be of a\ngeneric nature where the facts of the case called for. There\ncan be cases like the one in hand where there is no\ninfringement of a specific legislation or even where no\nlegislation is in place but are purely cases of infringement of\nfundamental rights and their violation. The directives are\nneeded to protect them and to ensure that the State discharges\nits obligation of protecting the rights of the people as well as\nthe environment. The deficiencies in the aforementioned fields\nare not deficiencies simplicitor but have far reaching\nconsequences of violating the fundamental protections and\nrights of the people at large. It is the obligation of the State to\nprovide safety, health care, means to freely move and to\nprofess the religion in the manner as they desire insofar as it\nis within the limitations of law.\nC\nD\nE\n30. Certainly some development projects would have to be\nundertaken but without infringing on the protection to the forests\nor the environment. These are ecologically and climatically\nsensitive areas. It must be ensured that development does not\nimpinge upon the purity of the environment beyond restricted\nand permissible limits. The doctrine of sustainable F\ndevelopment and precautionary principle would be the guiding\nfactors for the courts to pass such directions. We had the\nadvantage of having an Expert Committee Report before us,\nwhich recommends the various steps, development\nprogrammes and precautions that can be undertaken by the G\nGovernment and the Shrine Board to the advantage of all\nstakeholders, particularly the pilgrims. Thus, the directions we\ncontemplate to issue under this order are in conformity with\nthese legal maxims and are likely to cause no practical issues.\nH\nA\n1144 SUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2012] 13 S.C.R.\n31. Applying these principles to the facts of the present\ncase, it is apparently the constitutional obligation of this Court\nto issue specific directions in addition or which are to be read\nmutatis mutandis to the Report of the SHPC. In the above\nbackground, it is axiomatic for us to issue the following\nB directions:\n—Å\nD\nE\nLL\nF\n0\nH\n1)\n2)\n3)\n4)\nThe report of the SHPC is hereby accepted in\nterms of this judgment.\nThe recommendations contained in the report shall\nbe read, construed and applied in aid to the\ndirections of this Court and not in derogation\nthereto.\nAll the recommendations contained in the report\nshall be implemented under two different heads,\ni.e., 'short-term measures' and 'long-term\nmeasures'.

Piramal\nHealthcare Pvt. Ltd. (In I.A. No. 4 of 2012) for\nproviding pre-fabricated tents or toilets or such\nother material which they may chose to offer or\ndesired by the authorities, shall be considered by\nthe Shrine Board in its discretion. However, we\nobserve that the request of the applicant should be\nconsidered sympathetically and objectively.\n14) The walking track/passages should be widened and\nrailing and retaining walls be provided. The extent\nof width of the passage and manner of providing\nthe railing (thick iron cables supported by wooden\nCOURT ON ITS OWN MOTION v. UNION OF INDIA \u0026 1147\nORS. [SWATANTER KUMAR, J.]\nblocks or cement and stone) shall be in the A\ndiscretion of the Sub-Committee afore-constituted.\nBut, we make it clear that width of no passage shall\nbe less than 12 feet, particularly, that of the track\nleading from Panchtarni to the Holy Shrine.\n15) Neither have we directed nor should we be\nunderstood to have implicitly directed that there\nshould be mettled motorable road in place of the\nwalking tracks/passages.\n16) There shall be provided separate one way passage\nfor palkis and horses as one unit and the\npedestrians as the other, near to and at the\npassages leading to the Holy Shrine.
