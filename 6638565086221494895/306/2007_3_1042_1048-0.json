Appellant and other two accused were prosecuted\nunder Section 55 of the Kerala Abkari Act. The Judicial Magistrate found\nthem guilty of committing the crime under Section 55 of the Act and sentenced\nG them to simple imprisonment of two years. Appeal against the order of the\nJudicial Magistrate was dismissed by the Court of Sessions and Revision\npetition was dismissed by the High Court. Hence the present appeal.\nH\nAppellant contended that in the body of the judgment of the Sessions\n1042\nP.K. ARJUNAN v. STATE OF KERALA\n1043\nCourt, provisions of Section 55 of the Act had not been correctly reproduced A\nin so far as the words \"transports, transits or possesses\" after the words\n\"imports, exports\" and before the words \"liquor or any intoxicating drug\"\nwere missing and presumably, only on that premise, notice was issued and\nleave was granted; that the High Court having found that the appellant was\nnot the employee of another-accused, it was for the prosecution to show that\nB\nhe was in conscious possession of the contraband article, spirit, punishable\nunder Section 55(C) of the Act; and that, in any event, it was obligatory on\nthe part of the prosecution to establish existence of mens rea on the part of\naccused.\nDismissing the appeal, the Court\nHELD:1.1. Section 64 of the Kerala Abkari Act raises a presumption\nin regard to commission of offence in certain cases. If, therefore, a person is\nfound to be in possession of excise articles it is for him to adduce sufficient\nand cogent evidence to rebut the presumption. [Paras 7 and 8] [1046-D, E}\nC\nD\n1.2. Provisions in the Act having regard to the subject matter dealt with\nthereby should be read in the context of Article 47 of the Constitution of India.\nDealing in liquor is considered to be \"Res Extra Commercium\". The Act\nprohibits dealing with the said commodity except by way of a licence on the\nterms and conditions mentioned therein. Illegal manufacture, possession,\ntransport, export etc. have been brought within the purview of the penal E\nprovision contained in Section 55 of the Act. Various new provisions have\nbeen introduced by way of amendment carried out in the said Act from time to\ntime to bring within the purview of the statute the offences which were then\nunknown. [Para 10] [1046-G; 1047-A, B]\nF\n1.3 Section 55 of the Act provides for a penal provision. The words\n'transport, transit or possession' have been introduced in the said Section by\nSection 4 of the act 10 of 1955. By reason of the said amendment, the lacuna\nwhich existed in the statute thus was sought to be remedied. Even otherwise,\nall the clauses specified in Section 55 of the Act, if read in their entirety,\nwould give rise to a construction that the act of possession is involved in each G\none of the activities mentioned in the clauses specified therein.

No. 646/1993.\nF\nC.K. Sasi, Himinder Lal for the Appellant\nG\nG. Prakash for Ramesh Babu M.R. for the Respondent\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nS.B. SINHA, J. 1. The appellant along with one T.V. Raghavan Pillai\n(since deceased) and Ismail (absconding accused), were found to be in\npossession of 7985 litres of spirit in 42 barrels by the Circle Inspector of\nPolice, Hosdurg.\n2. Seizure of the said excise article was made on the basis of the\nH\nP.K. ARJUNAN v. STATE OF KERALA [S.B. SINHA, J.]\n1045\ninformation recieved by the said officer from DYSP, kanhangad to the effect A\nthat spirit for the purpose of manufacturing arrack was stored in a house in\nkoolingal, without any permit. Admittedly, all the three accused were found\nto be in possession of the said excise article.\n3. They were prosecuted under Section 55 of the Kerala Abkari Act\n(\"the Act\", for short) and were found guilty therefore.\nB\n4. The contention of the appellant before us was that he was an\nemployee of the said Ismail. The said defence has not been accepted. It\nappears that in the body of the judgment of the learned Sessions Judge,\nprovision of Section 55 of the Act had not been correctly reproduced in so\nfar as the words \"transports, transits or possesses\" after the words \"mport, C\nexport\" and before the words \"liquor or any intoxicating drug\" were missing.\nPresumably. only on that premises. notice was issued and leave was granted.\n5. Section 55 of the Act reads as under:\n\"55. For illegal import, etc.- Whoever in contravention of this Act or\nof any rule or order made under this Act-\n(a) imports, exports, transports, transits or possesses liquor or\nany intoxicating drug; or\n(b) Manufacture liquor or any intoxicating drug;\nXXX XXX XXX XXX\n(d) taps or causes to be tapped any toddy-producing tree, or\nD\nE\n(e) draws or causes to be drawn toddy from any tree; or\n(f) constructs or works any distillery, brewery. winery or other\nmanufactory in which liquor is manufacture; or\nF\n(g) uses, keeps, or has in his possession any material, still, utensil,\nimplement or apparatus whatsoever for the purpose of manufacturing\nliquor other than toddy or any intoxicating drug; or\n(h) bottles any liquor for purposes of sale; or\n(i) sells or stores for sale liquor or any intoxicating drug;\nshall be punishable.-\n(1) for any offence, other than an offence falling under clause (d)\nor clause (e), with imprisonment for a term which may extend to\nG\nH\n1046\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 3 S.C.R.\nten years and with fine which shall not be less than rupees one\nlakh and\n(2) for an offence falling under clause (d) or clause (e), with\nimprisonment for a term which may extend to one year or with fine\nwhich may extend to ten thousand rupees or with both.\"\n6. We may also notice the provisions of Section 58A of the Act which\nreads:\n\"For sale of certain preparations:- Whoever sells any preparation\nwhich he knows or has reason to believe is intended to serve as a\nsubstitute for alcohol or intoxicating drug shall, on conviction before\na competent court. be punished with imprisonment which may extend\nto five years. or with a fine which may extend to fifty thousand\nrupees, or with both.\nProvided that nothing contained in this section shall apply to the\nsale of any medicinal preparation for bona fide treatment. mitigation\nor prevention of disease in human beings or animals.\"\n7. Section 64 of the Act raises a presumption in regard to commission\nof offence in certain cases.\n8. If, therefore, a person is found to be in possession of excise articles\nit is for him to adduce sufficient and cogent evidence to rebut the said\npresumption.\n9. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant before us would\nraise two contentions. Firstly, it was submitted that the High Court having\nfound that the appellant was not the employee of the said Ismail, it was for\nthe prosecution to show that he was in conscious possession of the liquor\nor any intoxicating liquor punishable under Section 55 (c) of the Act. Secondly,\nit was contended that, in any event, it was obligatory on the part of the\nprosecution to establish existence of mens rea on his part. In support of the\naforesaid contention. reliance has been placed on Inder Sain v. State of\nG Punjab, [1973] 2 SCC 372 and Ram Rattan v. State of Punjab, (1979) Crl. L.J.\n791.\n10. The Act was enacted by the Maharaja of Cochin. After the formation\nof the State of Kerala, the said Act was adopted by the State. Provisions of\nthe said Act having regard to the subject matter dealt with thereby should,\nH inour opinion, be read in the context of Article 47 of the Constitution of India.\n►\n།\nP.K. ARJUNAN v. STATE OF KERALA [S.B. SINHA, J.]\n1047\nDealing in liquor is considered to be \"Res Extra Commercium\". The Act A\nprohibits dealing with the said commodity except by way of a licence on the\nterms and conditions mentioned therein. Illegal manufature possessoin,\ntransport, export etc. have been brought within the purview of the penal\nprovision contained in Section 55 of the Act. Various new provision have\nbeen introduced by way of amendment carried out in the said Act from time\nto time to bring within the purview of the statute the offences which than\nunknown.\nB\n11. Section 55 provides for a penal provision. The words 'transport,\ntransit or possession' have been introduced in the said section by Section\n4 of Act 10 of 1955. By reason of the said amendment, the lacuna which C\nexisted in the statute thus was sought to be remedied. Even otherwise. all the\nclauses specified in Section 55 of the Act. if read in their entirety. would give\nrise to a construction that the act of possession is involved in each one of\nthe activities mentioned in the clauses specified therein.\n12. A penal statute although is required to be construed strictly and a D\npotential offence would be presumed to be non-existing, the rule of purposive\nconstruction in a case of this nature and, in particular, in the matter of\npossessoin of the articles which have expressly been prohibited, came up for\nconsideration before this court in Indian Handicrafts Emporium \u0026 Ors. v.\nUnion of India \u0026 Ors. [2003] 7 SCC 589, wherein it was categorically held that\nE\nwhen the statutory provisions are clear and unambiguous, the same should\nbe given its due effect without taking recourse to any technical plea. The\nsame principle was reiterated in Balaram Kumawat v. Union of India \u0026 Ors.,\n[2003] 7 SCC 628:\n\"26. The courts will therefore reject that construction which will defeat\nF\nthe plain intention of the legislature even though there may be some\ninexactitude in the language used. (See Salmon v. Duncombe. (1886)\n11 AC 627). Reducing the legislature futility shall be avoided and in\na case where the intention of the legislature cannot be given effect\nto, the courts would accept the bolder construction forthe purpose of\nbringing about an effective result. The courts, when rule of purposive G\nconstruuction is gaining momentum, should be very relucant to hold\nthat Parliament has achieved nothing by the language it used when\nit is tolerably plain what it seeks to achieve.

Indisputably, where possession of a forbidden article constitutes an\noffence, the prosecution is duty bound to prove the ingredients therefor.\nExistence of mens rea. however, would be a question which has to be\ndetermined having regard to the provision of the statute.\n14. In Inder Sain (supra). whereupo the learned counsel placed strong\nreliance, the appellant therein recieved a consignment of a parcel of apples\nfrom one Uchana Das of Solan and he never had any occassion to know that\ntherein some opium was kept. Existence of opium in the said parcel of apples\nwas established only upon chemical examination. It was in the aforementioned\npremises, this Court held that as the expression \"possess\" was not crystal\nC clear in the provisions of the Opium Act, it was necessary for the prosecution\nto show that the accused had the article which turned out to be opium,\nstating:\nD\nE\nF\nG\n“In other words, the prosecution must prove that the accused was\nknowingly in control of something in circumstances which showed\nthat he was assenting to being in control of it.\"\n15. What was emphasised was that sonscious possession of the accused\nwas necessary for the purpose of establishing the guilt.\n16. The decision of this Court in Ram Rattan (supra), was to the same\neffect as, in that case, the prosecution failed to establish that the appellant\nwas in conscious possession of the opium recovered from his house. We do\nnot find that, in the Opium Act. there exists any pari materia provision like\nSection 64 of the Abkari Act. where the burden of proof was upon the\naccused to establish the foundation of the charge. Indisputably, thus, it was\nfor the accused to prove the same. Section 106 of the Evidence Act also is\na clear pointer to show that whoever has any special knowledge of fact, onus\nof proof in respect thereof would be on him.\n17. Learned counsel would submit that the offence having been commited\nin the year 1989 and the same being compoundable in nature at the relevant\npoint of time, leniency may be shown by this Court in the mater of quantum\nof sentence. We are not inclined to do so.\nS.K.S.\n•\n18. This appeal is, therefore, dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed.\n"}
