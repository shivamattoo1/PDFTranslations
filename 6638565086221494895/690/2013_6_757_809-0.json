The data collected by\nbiologists highlighted the necessity of a second natural\nhabitat for its long term conservation. In a workshop held\nin October, 1993, three alternative sites were suggested\nCENTRE FOR ENVIRONMENT LAW, WWF-I v. UNION 759\nOF INDIA\nfor re-introduction of Asiatic lions.

Article 21 of the Constitution of India protects not\nonly the human rights but also casts an obligation on\nhuman beings to protect and preserve a specie becoming\nextinct, conservation and protection of environment is an\ninseparable part of right to life. The State, as a custodian\nof the natural resources, has a duty to maintain them not\nmerely for the benefit of the public, but for the best\ninterest of flora and fauna, wildlife and so on. The doctrine\nof 'public trust' has to be addressed in that perspective. H\n762\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2013] 6 S.C.R.\nA [Para 41] [795-D-E, E-F]\nM. C. Mehta vs. Kamal Nath and Ors. (1997) 1 SCC 388:\n1996 (10) Suppl. SCR 12 - relied on.\n1.6. The human beings have a duty to prevent the\nB species from going extinct and have to advocate for an\neffective species protection regimes. NWAP 2002-2016\nand the Centrally Sponsored Scheme 2009 indicate that\nthere are many animal species which are close enough\nto extinction and some of the other species have already\nC disappeared from this earth. No species can survive on\nthe brink of extinction indefinitely and that the continued\nexistence of any specie depends upon various factors\nlike human-animal conflict, epidemics, forest fire and\nother natural calamities etc. [Para 48] [795-H; 796-A-B]\nD\n1.7. The Wildlife Biologists of Wildlife Institute of India\n(WII), an autonomous body under the Ministry of\nEnvironment and Forests (MOEF), after conducting a\nresearch on Gir Forests, noticed the necessity for long\nterm conservation of Asiatic lion in Gir and also\nE highlighted the necessity of a second natural habitat for\nits long term conservation. Population and Habitat\nAnalysis Workshop held at Baroda in October, 1993 also\nhighlighted that fact. National Board for Wildlife (NBWL),\nhas taken a consistent view in all its meetings about the\nF necessity of a second habitat for Asiatic Lion, an\nendangered species. Asiatic Lion, has been restricted to\nonly one single habitat, i.e. the Gir National Forest and its\nsurrounding areas and an outbreak of possible epidemic\nor natural calamity might wipe off the entire species. A\nG smaller population with limited genetic strength are more\nvulnerable to diseases and other catastrophes in\ncomparison to large and widespread population. Threat,\ntherefore, is real and has proved by the outbreak of\ncanine distemper in the lions of Serengeti NP, Tanzania\nin 1994. It was felt that if an epidemic of this scale were\nH\nCENTRE FOR ENVIRONMENT LAW, WWF-I v. UNION 763\nOF INDIA\nto affect the lions in Gir, it would be very difficult to save A\nthem from extinction, given the much smaller area of the\nGir forests and the smaller lion population. The possibility\nof the decease spreading to the pockets of habitat such\nas Girnar, Mityala, Rajula, Kodinar and the surrounding\nareas, cannot be ruled out. [Para 43] [796-B-G]\n1.8. There is uniformity in the views expressed by the\nBio-Scientists of WII, NBWL, MOEF and other experts that\nto have a second home for the endangered species like\nAsiatic Lion is of vital importance. A detailed study has\nbeen conducted to find out the most suitable habitat for\nits re-introduction and Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary in Madhya\nPradaesh, has been found to be the most ideal habitat.\n[Para 44] [796-H; 797-A-B]\nB\nC\nE..\n1.9. No State, organisation or person can claim D\nownership or possession over wild animals in the forest.\nWild Animal is defined under the Wild Life (Protection) Act,\n1972 under Section 2(36) to mean any animal specified in\nschedules I to IV and found wild in nature. 'Wild Life' has\nbeen defined under Section 2(37) to include any animal,\nbees, butterflies, crustacean, fish and moths, and or land\nvegetation which forms part of any habitat. Section 9\nprohibits hunting of wild animals, specified in Schedule I,\nII, III and IV except as provided under Section 11 and\nSection 12. Section 40 of the Act obliges a person to make\na declaration and Section 41 enables the Chief Wild Life\nWarden to make an enquiry and preparation of inventories\nand Section 42 deals with the issue of certificates and\nconfers, no ownership of the wild animals to a particular\nState or others. Animals in the wild are properties of the\nnation for which no state can claim ownership and the\nState's duty is to protect the wild life and conserve it, for\nensuring the ecological and environmental security of the\ncountry. [Para 45] [797-C-F]\nF\nG\n1.10. Several migratory birds, mammals, and animals H\n764\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2013] 6 S.C.R.\nA in wild, cross national and international borders created\nby man and every nation have a duty and obligation to\nensure their protection. No nation or organisation can\nclaim ownership or possession over them, the\nConvention on the conservation of migratory species of\nB wild animals held at Bonn, 1979, supports this principle\nand the convention recognises that wild animals in their\ninnumerable forms are irreplaceable part of the earth;\nnatural system and must be conserved for the good of\nthe mankind. It has recognised that the States are and\nmust be the protectors of the migratory species of wild\nanimals that live within or pass through their national\njurisdictional boundaries. Convention highlights that\nconservation and effective management of migratory\nspecies of wild animals require the concerted action of\nall States within the national jurisdictional boundaries of\nwhich such species spend any part of their life cycle.\nIndia is also a signatory to that convention. [Para 46] [797-\nG-H; 798-A-B]\nC\nD\n1.11. State Board for Wildlife, Gujarat (SBWL,\nE Gujarat), which has been constituted by the State\nGovernment under Section 6 of the Wildlife Protection\nAct, 1972, did not agree with the proposal for\ntranslocation of lion from Gujarat to Kuno, a stand\nendorsed by the State of Gujarat. The views of NBWL\nF constituted by the Central Government in exercise of its\npowers conferred under Section 5A of the Wildlife\nProtection Act, have to prevail over the views expressed\nby SBWL. The duties conferred on the National Board\nunder Section 5C of the Act and on the State Board under\nG Section 8 of the Act are entirely different. Statutorily, it is\nthe duty of NBWL to promote conservation and\ndevelopment of wildlife with a view to ensuring ecological\nand environmental security in the country. Legislation in\nits wisdom has conferred a duty on NBWL to provide\nconservation and development of wild life and forests.\nH\n_\nCENTRE FOR ENVIRONMENT LAW, WWF-I v. UNION 765\nOF INDIA\nB\nNBWL is, therefore, the top most scientific body A\nestablished to frame policies and advise the Central and\nState Governments on the ways and means of promoting\nwild life conservation and to review the progress in the\nfield of wild life conservation in the country and\nsuggesting measures for improvement thereto. The\nCentral and the State Governments cannot brush aside\nits opinion without any cogent or acceptable reasons. The\ndecisions taken by NBWL that Asiatic Lion should have\na second home to save it from extinction, due to\ncatastrophes like epidemic, large forest fire etc, which\ncould result in extinction, is justified. [Paras 28, 48 and\n50] [788-B-D; 800-A-B; 798-G; 799-D-H]\n1.12. Reintroduction of an animal or plant into the\nhabitat from where it has become extinct is also known\nas ex-situ conservation. India has successfully achieved\ncertain re-introduction programmes, for example, the\nRhino from Kaziranga, re-introduction of Gangetic gharial\nin the rivers of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan etc. Re-\nintroduction of an organism is the intentional movement\nof an organism into a part of its native range from which\nit has disappeared or become extirpated in historic times\nas a result of human activities or natural catastrophe.\nKuno was proved to be a historical habitat of Asiatic\nLions. [Paras 51 and 52] [800-D-G]\n1.13. After survey of the potential status for re-\nintroduction of Asiatic Lion, a final report was submitted\nby WII, which was published on 31.1.1995, whereby Kuno\nWildlife Sanctuary (Madhya Pradesh) emerged as the\nmost suitable habitat for re-introduction of the Asiatic lion.\nThe Council of Ministers approved the project on\n28.2.1996. Between 1996 and 2001, 24 villages with about\n1547 families had been translocated from the sanctuary\nby the Madhya Pradesh Forest Department. Government\nof Madhya Pradesh had also demarcated 1280 sq. kms.\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n766 SUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2013] 6 S.C.R.\nA Kuno Wildlife Division, encompassing the Sironi, Agra\nand Morawan forest ranges around the sanctuary.\nGovernment of India vide its order dated 21.1.1997\nordered diversion of 3720.9 hectares of forest land,\nincluding 18 villages were protected under Section 2 of\nB the Forest Conservation Act. A 20-years Project\nenvisaged by the Government of India was also\napproved by NBWL in its meeting held on 10.3.2004. The\nGovernment of Madhya Pradesh took up a massive re-\nlocation of villages and giving them alternative sites.\nGovernment of India has spent a sum of Rs.15 crores for\nthe said purpose. Thus all possible steps have been\ntaken by the State of Madhya Pradesh, MoEF and the\nUnion of India making Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary fit for re-\nintroduction of Asiatic lion, with the approval of NBWL.\n[Paras 52 and 53] [800-G-H; 801-A-E]\nC\nD\n1.14. Re-introduction of Asiatic lion should be in\naccordance with the guidelines issued by IUCN and with\nthe active participation of experts in the field of re-\nintroduction of endangered species. MoEF is therefore\nE directed to take urgent steps for re-introduction of Asiatic\nLion from Gir forests to Kuno. MoEF has to constitute an\nExpert Committee consisting of senior officials of MoEF,\nChief Wildlife Wardens of the States of Madhya Pradesh\nand Gujarat. Technical experts should also be the\nF members of the Committee. Any other expert can also be\nco-opted as the members of the Committee. The number\nof lions to be re-introduced would depend upon the\ndensity of prey base and other related factors, which the\nCommittee will assess. [Para 61] [808-C-F]\nG\nI.A.
