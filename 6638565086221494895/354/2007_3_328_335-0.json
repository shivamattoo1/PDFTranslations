Mannan, Arjun Garg and Rajul Shrivastava for the Appellant.\nC\nSatya Pal Jain, Vivek Goyal and Gopal Prasad for the Respondents.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nA.K. MATHUR, J. 1. This appeal is directed against the order dated\n1.8.2006 passed by the learned Single Judge of the Chhattisgarh High Court D\nat Bilaspur in Election Petition No. 9/2004 whereby the learned Single Judge\nhas allowed the election petition in part and set aside the election of the\nappellant for Malkharaud Assembly Constituency No. 38 to the Chhattisgarh\nState Legislative Assembly. Aggrieved against the said order the present\nappeal was filed.\nE\nF\n2. The Election Commission of India by Notification dated 7.11.2003,\nnotified the election to the Legislative Assembly of the State of Chhattisgarh\ninviting persons to submit their nomination papers between 7.11.2003 to\n14.11.2003 and 15.11.2003 was the date of scrutiny of the nomination papers\n\u0026 the last date for withdrawal of candidature was 17.11.2003. The election was\nfixed for 2nd December, 2003. Nine candidates filed their nominations. After\nscrutiny, petitioner along with respondents Nos. 1 to 7 remained in contest.\nThe polling took place on 2nd December, 2003 and the result was declared\non 4th December, 2003 declaring the appellant as elected for constituency.\nThe appellant was convicted by the Court of Additional Chief Judicial\nMagistrate, Sakti in Criminal Case No. 208/91- State of Chhattisgarh Vs. Lal G\nSai and two others under Section 420 read with Sections 34 and 468 read with\nSection 34 of the IPC and punished for two years., rigorous imprisonment\non each count and convicted under section 471 of the IPC and punished with\nrigorous imprisonment for one year by judgment and order dated 9.5.2002.\nAggrieved against this order appellant filed appeal before District Judge and\nH\n330\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 3 S.C.R.\nA learned Additional Sessions Judge by his order dated 31.5.2002 released\nappellant on furnishing Bond \u0026 Security \u0026 suspended judgment \u0026 Order of\nAdditional Chief Judicial Magistrate dated 9.5.2002. All candidates were\nrequired to submit their nomination alongwith their declaration and affidavit\nwherein they were required to disclose particulars of conviction for two years\nor more. The appellant Lalsai though he was convicted and was disqualified\nbut mislead the returning officer and concealed the vital information in the\naffidavit of his conviction. Therefore, the returning officer could not cancel\nhis nomination.\nB\n3. The lost candidate filed the present election petition raising the\nC question of disqualification of appellant under Section 8(3) of the\nRepresentation of People Act, 1951 (hereinafter referred as 'the R.P. Act'). The\ndefence of the appellant was that the execution of judgment and conviction\ndated 9.5.2002 was stayed by the appellate Court by its order dated 31.5.2002.\nTherefore, the returning Officer rightly rejected the objection raised before\nhim during the scrutiny and he was not disqualified and is not guilty of\nD suppression of the facts. He also took the plea that the election petitioner did\nE\nnot deposit the security amount within the prescribed time period, therefore,\npetition be dismissed being barred by time. The security deposit was made\non 19.1.2004 whereas the election petition was filed on 17.1.2004. As such\nelection petition is barred by time. However, it may be stated at the outset\nthat so far as this objection is concerned we ourselves checked up the date\nand we find that the election petition was filed on 19.1.2004 with security\namount. Hence, this objection is factually incorrect and overruled.\n4. The question before us is whether the order passed by the appellate\nCourt in a Criminal Case on 9.5.2002 whereby the conviction and sentence of\nF the appellant was suspended, whether this amounts to staying the conviction\nor not? All other questions are not relevant except the aforesaid question.\nHowever, learned Single Judge after relying on decision of this Court in the\ncase of K. Prabhakaran v. P. Jayarajan reported in [2005] 1 SCC 754, held\nthat the returning officer committed an illegality in accepting the nomination\nof the appellant because the appellant's conviction was not stayed but\nG\nsuspended. Therefore, incumbent was disqualified at the time of scrutiny and\naccordingly the learned Judge decided this issue in favour of the election\npetitioner and consequently the election petition was allowed and election\nwas set aside. Hence, the present appeal.\nH\n5. We have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the\n་\nLALSAI KHUNTE v. NIRMAL SINHA [A.K. MATHUR, J.]\n331\nrecord.\nA\n6. The main question before us is whether the view taken by the learned\nsingle Judge of the High Court is correct or not?\n7. Section 8(3) of the Representation of People Act, 1951 is reproduced\nhereunder:\nB\n\"8. Disqualification on conviction for certain offences.-\n;\n(1)\n(2).\n(3) A person convicted of any offence and sentenced to\nimprisonment for not less than two years (other than any offence\nreferred to in sub-section (1) or sub-section (2) shall be disqualified\nfrom the date of such conviction and shall continue to be disqualified\nfor a further period of six years since his release.\n(4) ..............\n\"\n8. The legal position is already crystallized by this Court in the case of\nK. Prabhakaran (Supra) wherein it was held as under:\nC\nᎠ\n\"42. What is relevant for the purpose of Section 8(3) is the actual E\nperiod of imprisonment which any person convicted shall have to\nundergo or would have undergone consequent upon the sentence of\nimprisonment pronounced by the court and that has to be seen by\nreference to the date of scrutiny of nominations or date of election.\nAll other factors are irrelevant. A person convicted may have filed an F\nappeal. He may also have secured an order suspending execution of\nthe sentence or the order appealed against under Section 389 of the\nCode of Criminal Procedure, 1973. But that again would be of no\nconsequence. A court of appeal is empowered under Section 389 to\norder that pending an appeal by a convicted person the execution of\nthe sentence or order appealed against be suspended and also, if he G\nis in confinement, that he be released on bail or bond. What is\nsuspended is not the conviction or sentence; it is only the execution\nof the sentence or order which is suspended. It is suspended and not\nobliterated. It will be useful to refer in this context to a Constitution\nBench judgment of this Court in Sarat Chandra Rabha v. H\nA\nB\nC\nᎠ\nE\nF\nG\nH\n332\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 3 S.C.R.\nKhagendranath Nath? The convict had earned a remission and the\nperiod of imprisonment reduced by the period of remission would\nhave had the effect of removing disqualification as the period of\nactual imprisonment would have been reduced to a period of less than\ntwo years. The Constitution Bench held that the remission of sentence\nunder Section 401 of the Criminal Procedure Code (old) and his release\nfrom jail before two years of actual imprisonment would not reduce the\nsentence to one of a period of less than two years and save him from\nincurring the disqualification.\n\"An order of remission thus does not in any way interfere with the\norder of the court; it affects only the execution of the sentence passed\nby the court and free the convicted person from his liability to undergo\nthe full term of imprisonment inflicted by the court, though the order\nof conviction and sentence passed by the court still stands as it was.\nThe power to grant remission is executive power and cannot have the\neffect which the order of an appellate or revisional court would have\nof reducing the sentence passed by the trial court and substituting\nin its place the reduced sentence adjudged by the appellate or\nrevisional court.\"\n9. Recently this Court in the case of Ravikant S. Patil v. Sarvabhouma\nS. Bagali reported in (2006) 12 SCALE 295 has clearly held that the Court has\nenough power to stay the conviction. It was held as under:-\"\n“it deserves to be clarified that an order granting stay of conviction\nis not the rule but is an exception to be resorted to in rare cases\ndepending upon the facts of a case. Where the execution of the\nsentence is stayed, the conviction continues to operate. But where\nthe conviction itself is stayed, the effect is that the conviction will not\nbe operative from the date of stay. An order of stay, of course, does\nnot render the conviction non-existent, but only non-operative. Be\nthat as it may, insofar as the present case is concerned, an application\nwas filed specifically seeking stay of the order of conviction specifying\nthat consequences if conviction was not stayed, that is, the appellant\nwould incur disqualification to contest the election. The High Court\nafter considering the special reason, granted the order staying the\nconviction. As the conviction itself is stayed in contrast to a stay of\nexecution of the sentence, it is not possible to accept the contention\nof the respondent that the disqualification arising out of conviction\nk\nLALSAI KHUNTE v. NIRMAL SINHA [A.K. MATHUR, J.]\ncontinues to operate even after stay of conviction.\"\n333\n10. Again recently in the case of Navjot Singh Sidhu v. State of Punjab,\nreported in T (2007) 2 SC 382, Hon'ble Court while entertaining the appeal of\naccuse stayed the conviction. The relevant portion of the judgment reads as\nunder:\nA\nB\nC\n\"13.1 The Act provides not only the eligibility and qualification for\nmembership of House of People and Legislative Assembly but also for\ndisqualification on conviction and other matters. The Parliament in its\nwisdom having made a specific provision for disqualification on\nconviction by enacting Section 8, it is not for the Court to abridge or\nexpand the same. The decisions of this Court rendered in Rama\nNarang V. Kant S. Patil v. Sarvabhouma S. Bagali (Supra) having\nrecognized the power possessed by the Court of appeal to suspend\nor stay an order of the conviction and having also laid down the\nparameters for exercise of such power, it is not possible to hold, as\na matter of rule, or to lay down, that in order to prevent any person D\nwho has committed an offence from entering the Parliament or the\nLegislative Assembly the order of the conviction should not be\nsuspended. The Courts have to interpret the law as it stands and not\non considerations which may be perceived to be morally more correct\nor ethical.\"\n11. Therefore, this Court in recent decisions held that the appellate\nCourt has power to stay the execution of the conviction and if appellate Court\nhas stayed the conviction then in that case, this will not operate as a\ndisqualification. But simply order of suspension of the sentence will not\noperate as staying the conviction. It was specifically mentioned that the stay\nof order of the conviction will mean it is temporarily non-operative.\nE\nF\nG\n12. As already mentioned above, in the present case it is clearly transpired\nthat the appellate Court suspended the order of the trial court dt. 9th May,\n2002 and granted the bail to the accused appellant. The suspension does not\nmean the stay of the conviction. We have ourselves seen the application for\nsuspension of sentence. The said application is a routine application under\nSection 389 whereby the appellant sought for the suspension of sentence.\nThere is nothing in that application to suggest that the applicant therein had\nsought the stay of conviction in contra-distinction to the suspension of\nsentence. In Ravi Kant Patel's case cited supra, it will be seen that an\napplication for stay of conviction was specifically filed specifying the H\n334\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 3 S.C.R.\nA consequences if the conviction was not stayed. This Court had taken that\nfact into consideration while holding that in that case the conviction was\nspecifically stayed. Such is not the case here. If the incumbent had been\nvigilant enough, he could have moved the court even later on after obtaining\nthe stay of conviction particularly in view of the fact that he wanted to\ncontest the election but that was not done.\nB\nC\n13. In the case of Rama Narang v. Ramesh Narang and Ors., reported\nin [1995] 2 SCC 513 their Lordships were examining the effect of conviction\nunder the Companies Act, 1956, that what is the effect of the conviction of\nManaging Director for an offence involving moral turpitude as disqualification\nand suspension of that conviction by the appellate court. This Court after\nexamining the question took the view that Section 389(1) of the CR.P.C.\nconfers the power on appellate Court to stay the operation of the order of\nthe conviction. If the order of conviction is to result to some disqualification\nof the type mentioned in Section 267 of the Companies act, a narrow meaning\nshould not be given to Section 389(1) of the Code to bar the Court from\nD granting an order staying operation of order of conviction in a fit case.\nTherefore, their Lordships were very clear that Section 389(1) of the Code\nempowers the appellate court to stay the conviction also. But suspension will\nnot amount to staying the conviction. It was held as under:\nE\nF\nG\nH\nThat takes us to the question whether the scope of Section 389(1) of\nthe Code extends to conferring power on the Appellate Court to stay\nthe operation of the order of conviction. As stated earlier, if the order\nof conviction is to result in some disqualification of the type mentioned\nin section 267 of the Companies Act, we see no reason why we should\ngive a narrow meaning to Section 389(1) of the Code to debar the\ncourt from granting an order to that effect in a fit case. The appeal\nunder Section 374 is essentially against the order of conviction because\nthe order of sentence is merely consequential thereto; albeit even the\norder of sentence can be independently challenged if it is harsh and\ndisproportionate to the established guilt. Therefore, when an appeal\nis preferred under Section 374 of the Code the appeal is against both\nthe conviction and sentence and therefore, we see no reason to place\na narrow interpretation on Section 389(1) of the Code not to extend\nit to an order of conviction, although that issue in the instant case\nrecedes to the background because High Courts can exercise inherent\njurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code if the power was not to be\nfound in Section 389(1) of the Code. We are, therefore, of the opinion\nLALSAI KHUNTE v. NIRMAL SINHA [A.K. MATHUR. J.]\n335\nthat the Division Bench of the High Court of Bombay was not right A\nin holding that the Delhi High Court could not have exercised\njurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code if it was confronted with\na situation of there being no other provision in the Code for staying\nthe operation of the order of conviction. In a fit case if the High Court\nfeels satisfied that the order of conviction needs to be suspended or\nB\nstayed so that the convicted person does not suffer from a certain\ndisqualification provided for in any other statute, it may exercise the\npower because otherwise the damage done cannot be undone; the\ndisqualification incurred by Section 267 of the Companies Act and\ngiven effect to cannot be undone at a subsequent date if the conviction\nis set aside by the Appellate Court. But while granting a stay of (sic C\nor) suspension of the order of conviction the Court must examine the\npros and cons and if it feels satisfied that a case is made out for grant\nof such an order, it may do so and in so doing it may, if it considers\nit appropriate, impose such conditions as are considered appropriate\nto protect the interest of the shareholders and the business of the\nD\ncompany.\"\n14. As already pointed out above that on 31st May, 2002, the appellate\nCourt while granting him the bail only suspended the impugned order dated\n9th May, 2002. Thus suspension does not amount to temporarily washing out\nthe conviction. The conviction still remains, only the operation of the order\nand the sentence remain suspended that does not amount to temporary stay\nof the conviction. A specific order staying conviction has to be sought.\n15. Hence, the view taken by the learned Single Judge of the Chhattisgarh\nHigh Court is correct and there is no ground to interfere. This appeal is\ndismissed with no order as to costs.\nR.P.\nAppeal dismissed.\nE\nF\n"}
