No.15123 of 2011, which\nas mentioned hereinabove, was allowed by the Division Bench\nof the High Court and directions were given for making the\nappointments of Vice Chancellors and Pro Vice Chancellors\nafresh.\nDR. RAM TAWAKYA SINGH v. STATE OF BIHAR 171\n[G.S. SINGHVI, J.]\nA-\nB\nC\nD\n9. Shri Harish N. Salve, learned senior counsel appearing\nfor the State and Shri Prashant Bhushan, learned counsel\nappearing for Dr. Ram Tawakya Singh referred to the\nprovisions of the BSU Act and PU Act as also the regulations\nframed by the University Grants Commission (UGC) under\nSection 26 of the University Grants Commission Act, 1956 for\nselection of Pro Vice-Chancellors / Vice-Chancellors and\nargued that the direction given by the Division Bench of the High\nCourt to the Chancellor to propose names for appointment of\nVice-Chancellors and Pro Vice-Chancellors is liable to be set\naside and the appointments made by him are liable to be\nquashed because by taking advantage of the direction\ncontained in the impugned order, the Chancellor arbitrarily\nprepared the list of the persons to be appointed as Vice-\nChancellors and Pro Vice-Chancellors without making any\nselection whatsoever and without following any transparent\nmethod for making a choice from amongst the persons of\nacademic excellence, unquestionable integrity and institutional\ncommitment and without effectively consulting the State\nGovernment. Both, Shri Salve and Shri Prashant Bhushan\nemphasised that the Chancellor did not even try to find out\nwhether persons of academic excellence are available in the\ncountry and prepared the list which included some persons\nagainst whom criminal cases are registered with the police\nand/or are pending in the Court(s). Learned counsel relied upon\nUGC regulations dated 30.6.2010 and argued that even though\nthe BSU Act and the PU Act were not suitably amended for\nincorporating the regulations, the Chancellor was duty bound\nto keep in mind the parameters laid down by the UGC for\nselecting the candidates for appointment as Vice-Chancellors\nand Pro Vice-Chancellors and prepared list of eligible persons\nhaving highest level of competence, integrity, morals and G\ninstitutional commitment and this could have been possible only\nif he had made a holistic selection by extending zone of\nselection beyond the frontiers of the State. Learned counsel\nsubmitted that instead of making a fair selection, the Chancellor\nmanipulated re-appointment of those who were ousted by virtue H\nE\nF\n172\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2013] 9 S.C.R.\nA of the High Court's order. Shri Prashant Bhushan submitted that\nthe Chancellor had shown his scant respect to the law laid down\nby the learned Single Judge and the Division Bench of the High\nCourt and made appointments without effective consultation\nwith the State Government. He submitted that the haste with\nB which the Chancellor ensured the issue of Notifications dated\n9.2.2013 is a proof of the oblique motive with which he pushed\nthe appointments of even those who are facing trial for criminal\noffences. Shri Salve submitted that after having learnt about the\nvigilance inquiries being conducted into the antecedents of the\ncandidates proposed by him, the Chancellor should have\nwaited for the vigilance reports and then only he could have\nmade appointments.\nC\nD\n10. Shri Ram Jethmalani, Shri Anil B.Divan, senior\nadvocates and other learned counsel appearing for the private\nrespondents defended the appointments of their clients and\nargued that the methodology adopted by the Chancellor cannot\nbe dubbed as arbitrary because he had consulted the State\nGovernment before ordering the issue of Notifications dated\n9.2.2013. Learned senior counsel submitted that the UGC\nE regulations cannot be invoked for quashing the appointments\nof the private respondents because the State legislature has\nnot engrafted the same in the BSU Act and the PU Act by\nmaking appropriate amendments. Shri Jethmalani argued that\nthe regulations framed by the UGC are in the nature of\nF subordinate legislation and they cannot override the plenary\nlegislation, i.e., the State Acts. In support of this argument, he\nrelied upon judgments of this Court in State of U.P. v.\nManbodhan Lal Srivastava AIR 1957 SC 912 and Prem\nChand Garg v. Excise Commissioner AIR 1963 SC 996.\nLearned senior counsel also relied upon the judgment of this\nCourt in Kishore Samrite v. State of U.P. (2013) 2 SCC 398\nand argued that Dr. Ram Tawakya Singh does not have the\nlocus standi to challenge the appointments of Vice-Chancellors\nand Pro Vice-Chancellors because he was not a competitor\nfor any of the posts. Shri Jethmalani and Shri Divan submitted\nH\nG\nDR. RAM TAWAKYA SINGH v. STATE OF BIHAR 173\n[G.S. SINGHVI, J.]\nA\nB\nthat the appeal filed by the State and its functionaries should\nbe dismissed because they not only waited till the issue of\nnotifications for fresh appointments but also made misleading\nstatement about the so called delay on the Governor's part in\napproving the amendments made by the State legislature\npurporting to incorporate the UGC regulations. Shri Anil Divan\nstrongly criticised the State Government for deliberately not\namending the relevant enactments to bring them in tune with\nthe UGC regulations and submitted that the Governor cannot\nbe blamed for not approving the Bill passed by the legislature\nbecause composition of the Search Committee proposed in c\nthe amendment made by the State legislature was loaded with\nbureaucrats, who would have never allowed others to play their\nrole in selecting suitable persons and this would have effectively\nfrustrated the object of appointing Vice-Chancellors and Pro\nVice-Chancellors from amongst distinguished academicians.\nLearned counsel pointed out that majority of the appointees are\nhaving excellent academic record and vast experience of\nteaching in different Universities/Colleges and argued that their\nappointment should not be quashed simply because some of\nthe candidates are facing prosecution. In the end, Shri Anil\nDivan submitted that even if this Court comes to the conclusion\nthat the appointments made by the Chancellor are contrary to\nthe scheme of the BSU Act and the PU Act, the private\nrespondents who have clean record should be allowed to hold\nthe posts and discharge the functions of Vice-Chancellors and\nPro Vice-Chancellors till fresh appointments are made so that\ntheir image and integrity may not be adversely affected.\n11.
