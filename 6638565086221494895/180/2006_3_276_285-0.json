DA initiated anti dumping investigation against the subject\ncountries concerning imports of SBR classified under custom sub-heading\n4002.19 of schedule I during 1.4.1996 to 31.8.1997.

The Court found\nno justification to take a view other than what had been taken by the\nDesignated Authority and the Tribunal. Accordingly, the findings recorded\nby the Designated Authority as well as by the Tribunal on this point are\nC\nconfirmed. [282-C-D]\n2. Tribunal after noticing the observations of the Designated\nAuthority in para 7 of its order held that the Designated Authority wanted\nto impose anti-dumping duty on all grades of SBR irrespective of whether\nit fell under heading 39.03 or 40.02. However the findings recorded by D\nthe Designated Authority in para 7 of its order clearly indicate that the\nDesignated Authority did not intend to cover SBR which was being\nimported under sub-heading 3903.90 for the purpose of imposing duty;\nwhat the Designated Authority held was, that if the goods were being\nimported by wrongly classifying them under sub-heading 4002.19, then\nthe Customs Authorities are at liberty and expected to classify the goods E\ncorrectly. It was held by the Designated Authority that while giving the\nimport statistics. Respondent No. 3 had submitted information in respect\nof Custom Heading 4002.19 only; that Chapter 39 covers \"Plastic and\nArticles thereof\" whereas Chapter 40 covers \"Rubber and Articles\nthereof\" Styrene Butadiene Rubber, as the name suggests, is a synthetic\nrubber and would be covered under Chapter 40 and not 39; that as per\nnote no. 2(h) of Chapter 39, synthetic rubbers and articles thereof, which\nare covered under Chapter 40, do not fall under Chapter 39. The\nDesignated Authority had recorded a firm finding that \"Elastomer Resin\nKHS 68” was not covered for the purpose of imposing duty. The finding\nrecorded by the designated authority was categorical and not a clerical G\nomission, as has been observed by the Tribunal. It was not correct on the\npart of the Tribunal to hold on its own motion that \"this is a clerical\nomission which is required to be corrected.\" Finding recorded by the\nTribunal in this respect deserves to be set aside.\n[282-G; 283-B; 284-G, H; 285-A-C]\nF\nH\nA\nB\n278\n2001.\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2006] 3 S.C.R.\nCIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal Nos. 774-775 of\nFrom the Final Order No. 21/2000-AD and Corrigendum Misc.

By\nthe order dated 2nd of February, 2000, the Tribunal rejected the appeals filed\nby the appellant except to the extent that it held that variable anti-dumping\nduty greater than dumping margin could not be imposed. The order dated 3rd\nof February, 2000 is merely a Corrigendum correcting the clerical mistake in\nthe order No.21/2000-AD dated 2nd February, 2000.\nThe appellant Rishiroop Polymers Private Limited is the authorised\nexclusive Intending Agents and Representatives of Messrs Korea Kumho\nPetrochemials Company Limited (KKPC), Republic of Korea for the sale of\ntheir products, namely, Styrene Butadiene Rubber (SBR) and other products.\nThe appellant has been authorised by KKPC under an authorization dated 6th\nMay, 1998 to appear and plead on their behalf. The present appeals have\nG been filed by the appellant in its capacity as an interested/aggrieved party and\nas also the representatives of KKPC.\nH\nSynthetics and Chemicals Limited (respondent no.3 herein) filed an\nAnti Dumping Petition on 9th of September, 1997 before the Designated\nAuthority appointed under the Customs Tariff Act, 1975 (for short \"the Tariff\nx\nRISHIROOP POLYMERS PVT. LTD. v. DESIGNATED AUTHORITY AND ADDI, SECTY. [BHAN, J.] 279\nAct\") against the imports of SBR originating in or exported from Japan, A\nKorea, Turkey, Taiwan, USA, Germany and France. It was alleged therein\nthat the import of SBR from the subject countries was causing injury to the\ndomestic industry manufacturing SBR in India. Respondent No.3 furnished\ndetails regarding the normal value of the products in the subject countries\nand the margin of dumping. It was alleged that as a result of the dumped B\nimports of SBR the domestic industry, namely, Respondent No.3, was incurring\nheavy losses on its SBR activity. It was further alleged that in spite of the\ncost of production in the subject countries, exporters from there were reducing\ntheir export price consistently which has forced the domestic industry to\nreduce its selling price of various grades of SBR. That the selling price\nrealised by the domestic industry is so low that it is unable to recover even C\nthe cost of production. That the dumped materials had retarded the growth of\ndomestic industry in spite of installation of new plant and machinery. The\nexpansion programme could not be commissioned as the dumped imports\nthreatened to cause injury for future also due to sufficient freely disposable\nproduction capacity in the subject countries.\nD\nThe Designated Authority, on the basis of the application filed by\nRespondent No.3, initiated anti-dumping investigation against the subject\ncountries concerning imports of SBR classified under custom sub-heading\n4002.19 of Schedule I of the Tariff Act, originating in or exported from the\nsubject countries. The period of investigation was fixed by the Designated E\nAuthority for 17 months, i.e., from 1st April, 1996 to 31st August, 1997.\nThe Designated Authority on the basis of the material collected,\npublished its preliminary findings as per Notification dated 21st January,\n1999. By the said Notification anti-dumping duties were imposed on different\ngrades of SBR originating from the subject countries. The Designated Authority F\nfurther invited details and comments from all interested parties including the\nexporters from the subject countries. The Designated Authority submitted its\nfinal findings which were accepted by the Government of India, Ministry of\nCommerce and accordingly issued a Notification of final findings. By the\nsaid final findings, the Authority had concluded that:\n(a) SBR had been exported from Japan, Korea R.P., Turkey, Taiwan,\nUSA, Germany and France to India below its normal value\nresulting in dumping of SBR;\n(b) The domestic industry has suffered material injury;\nG\nH\n(c) Causal link between dumping and injury was established.\nA\nB\n280\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2006] 3 S.C.R.\nBy Gazette Notification No. 421, the Ministry of Finance, issued a\nNotification No. 107/00-Cus dated 24th August, 1999 in exercise of powers\nconferred by sub-section (2) of the Tariff Act, notifying the final anti-dumping\nduty on the basis of the recommendations in the final findings dated 2nd of\nJune, 1999.\nThe appellant being aggrieved, filed appeals before the Tribunal against\nthe final findings dated 2nd of June, 1999. In the Memorandum of Appeals,\ngrounds were taken, inter alia, as to the issues of normal value dumping\nmargin, injury causal link in the context of domestic industry and like articles.\nDuring the course of arguments, as noted by the Tribunal in paragraph 4 of\nC its order, counsel appearing for the appellant did not urge any ground other\nthan that domestic industry has not suffered injury on account of import of\nSBR from the subject countries and that there was no causal link between the\ninjury and import from the subject countries. Accordingly, the Tribunal did\nnot go into the question as to whether the fixation of normal value and\ndumping margin of articles imported from the subject countries was correct\nor not. The Tribunal also did not go into the question as to whether the\nnormal selling price fixed by the Designated Authority was correct. The\nTribunal by the impugned order rejected the appeals except to the extent that\nvariable anti-dumping duty greater than the dumping margin could not be\nimposed. As opposed to the variable duty imposed by the final findings, the\nE Tribunal imposed fixed duties. Tribunal imposed fixed duty in respect of\n1500 and 1700 series of SBR imported from Korea Kumho. By a Corrigendum\nMiscellaneous Order No. 1/2000-AD (which was certified on 16th of February,\n2000 and communicated to the appellant on 21st February, 2000), anti-\ndumping duty was also imposed in respect of the 1900 series of SBR.\nᎠ\nF\nG\nH\nThe submission of the counsel appearing for the appellant that the\nDesignated Authority while assessing injury to the domestic industry in case\nof certain parameters, had taken into consideration the data relating to the\nyear immediately preceding the period of investigation was rejected by the\nTribunal by observing, thus:\n\u003c\nEven though data for 1994-95 was also noted in the work-sheet,\nassessments were made based on the data relating to the year 1995-\n96 only. Compared to 1995-96 there was noticeable increase in stock\nof various grades of SBR with the domestic industry; that there was\nconsiderable increase of imports from subject countries; there was\nloss in the profitability on the manufacture of SBR and in relation to\nt\nRISHIROOP POLYMERS PVT. LTD. v. DESIGNATED AUTHORITY AND ADDI. SECTY. [BHAN, J.] 281\naverage realization. On going through those data we are convinced A\nthat the domestic industry suffered drastic decline in all the relevant\nparameters during the period of investigation compared to those of\nthe immediately preceding financial year, namely, 1995-96.\n(emphasis supplied)\nAnother finding recorded by the Tribunal was that \"the Designated\nAuthority wanted to impose anti-dumping duty on all grades of Styrene\nButadiene Rubber irrespective of whether it is put under Heading 3903 or\n4002. But while concluding the final finding, anti dumping duty has been\nimposed on SBR falling under sub-heading 4002.19 only. This is a clerical\nomission which is required to be corrected. Thus, we make it clear that Anti\nDumping duty is on all grades of SBR, whether falling under sub-heading\n4002 or 3903. Customs Authorities have to impose duty on all types of SBR,\nirrespective of their classification.\"\nB\nC\nLearned Counsel appearing for the appellant did not put a challenge to D\nthe finding recorded by the Tribunal as regards the causal link between injury\nsuffered by the domestic industry on account of import of SBR from the\nsubject countries.\nF\nLearned counsel appearing for the appellant put forth three-fold\nsubmissions. Firstly, that the Designated Authority while assessing injury to E\nthe domestic industry in case of certain parameters, had taken into\nconsideration the data relating to the year immediately preceding the period\nof investigation whereas the Tribunal in para 12 of the impugned order has\nheld that the injury assessment by the Designated Authority was based on the\ndata relating to the year 1995-96 only. According to him, finding recorded\nby the Tribunal was factually incorrect. The second submission relates to the\nimposition of duty on products falling under Tariff Entry 3903.90 by the\nTribunal. It was submitted that against the finding recorded by the Designated\nAuthority that the products in question fell under heading 4002.19, neither\nthe Union of India nor Respondent No.3 or any other interested party had\nfiled appeal or objections to the finding recorded by the Designated Authority; G\nthat the Tribunal had come to this conclusion suo motu and hence this portion\nof the order was liable to be set aside. The third and the last argument deals\nwith the point that the Tribunal has converted the duty imposed in US dollar\nterm from the rupee value term without there being any appeals/prayer either\nby the Union of India or any other interested party.\n}\nH\nA\nB\n282\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2006] 3 S.C.R.\nWe do not find much substance in the submission relating to the first\npoint. The Tribunal in its order has noted that even though data for the year\n1994-95 was also noted in the work-sheet, assessment was based on the data\nrelating to the year 1995-96 only. In order to satisfy ourselves, we sent for\nthe original confidential file. After going through the same, we find that\nthough data for 1994-95 was noted by the Designated Authority in the work-\nsheet, but the assessment was made on the basis of the data relating to the\nyear 1995-96 only. Compared to 1995-96 there was considerable increase in\nthe stock of various grades of SBR with the domestic industry. There was a\nloss in the profitability in the manufacture of SBR in relation to the average\nrealization. Having gone through the confidential records produced before us\nC and the data for the years 1995-96 and 1996-97, we are satisfied that the\ndomestic industry suffered drastic decline in all the relevant parameters during\nthe period of investigation compared to those of the immediately preceding\nFinancial Year 1995-96. We find no justification to take a view other than\nwhat has been taken by the Designated Authority and the Tribunal.\nAccordingly, the findings recorded by the Designated Authority as well as by\nthe Tribunal on this point are confirmed.\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nComing to the second point, it may be noted that the subject under\nconsideration by the Designated Authority was \"Styrene Butadiene Rubber”.\nChapter 40 of the Tariff Act deals with \"Rubber and Articles thereof”. Tariff\nentries 40.01 and 40,02 read as follows:\nTariff Entry 40.01\n“Natural Rubber, balata, gutta percha, Guayule, chicle and similar\nnatural gums, in primary forms or in plates, sheets or strip.\"\nTariff Entry 40.02\n\"Synthetic rubber and factor derived from oils, in primary forms or\nin plates, sheets of strip; mi xtures of any product of heading No.40.01\nwith any product of this heading, in primary forms or in plates, sheets\nor strip.\"\nTribunal after noticing the following observations of the Designated\nAuthority in para 7 of its order:\n\"The Authority thus holds that whereas it is not justified to cover all\nitems falling under the sub-heading 3903.90, for the purpose of\nimposing anti-dumping duty in present case the anti-dumping duty\n1\nRISHIROOP POLYMERS PVT. LTD. 1. DESIGNATED AUTHORITY AND ADDI. SECTY. {BHAN. J.] 283\nhowever is payable on Styrene Butadiene Rubber of specified series A\nas stated, even if it is sought to be cleared under any other heading\nof the Custom Tariff Act. The Custom Authority is at liberty and\nexpected to classify the goods correctly, if the goods offered for\nclearance are not classified correctly.\"\nC\nheld \\that the Designated Authority wanted to impose anti-dumping duty on B\nall grades of SBR irrespective of whether it fell under heading 39.03 or\n40.02. The Designated Authority imposed the anti-dumping duty on the SBR\nfalling in sub-heading 4002.19 only which was a clerical omission and required\nto be corrected. Accordingly, the Tribunal held that anti-dumping duty was\nliable to be imposed on all grades of SBR falling under sub-heading 4002.19\nor 3903.90. That the Customs Authorities have to impose duty on all types\nof SBR irrespective of their classification. After going through the order of\nthe Designated Authority and the Tribunal, we are of the opinion that the\nTribunal has quoted and relied upon the observation of the Designated\nAuthority in paragraph 7 reproduced above, out of context. The Designated\nAuthority in paragraph 5 of its order observed, thus:\nI\nD\n\"The Authority observes that items falling under 3903.90 are not\nproduct under consideration and SBR in 1000 series is not produced\nby the petitioner and thus are not product under consideration.\"\nPara 7 of the final finding of the Designated Authority reads thus: E\n\"The Authority observes that, in the preliminary findings it was inter-\nalia held that product under consideration in the present investigation\nis Styrene Butadiene Rubber (SBR) originating in or exported from\nthe subject countries classified under Custom sub-heading 4002.19 of\nthe Custom Tariff Act which was explained at para 5 of the preliminary\nfindings dated 21st January, 1999. The Authority had inter alia held\nthat product under consideration is SBR of 1500 series, 1700 series\nand 1900 series under Custom sub-heading 4002.19 of Custom Tariff\nAct. None of the interested parties has raised any argument in this\nF\nregard and therefore the Authority confirms it preliminary findings in G\nthis regard.\nThe Authority notes that petitioner is claiming that SBR is also being\ncleared under custom chapter 39 Entry no.3903.90 (polymers of styrene\nin primary forms) and therefore the anti-dumping duty should be\nimposed under this head also. On the contrary it is argued by exporter H\nA\nB\nC\nD\n(I)\nE\nF\n284\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2006] 3 S.C.R.\nand importer that chapter 39 relates to plastic and does not cover\nSBR and therefore duty should not be imposed on products covered\nunder chapter 39 Entry no. 3903.90. The Authority observes that\nchapter 39 covers \"Plastic \u0026 Articles Thereof\" whereas chapter 40\ncovers \"Rubber \u0026 Articles Thereof” Styrene Butadiene Rubber as the\nname suggest is a synthetic rubber and is covered under chapter 40.\nIt is also observed that as per note no. 2(h) of chapter 39, the synthetic\nrubbers and articles thereof which are covered under chapter 40, do\nnot fall under chapter 39. It is also observed that while giving the\nimport statistics, the petitioner had submitted information in respect\nof custom heading No.4002.19 only. While submitting the evidence\nthat SBR 1900 series is also being imported under chapter 39, the\nAuthority observes that the items cleared under chapter 39 is\n\"Elastomer Resin KHS 68\" and thus is not under the nomenclature\nof \"Synthetic Rubber\". In view of this, the Authority does not find\njustification to cover item falling under sub-heading 3903.90 for the\npurpose of imposing anti-dumping duty.\nHowever, the Authority agrees with the argument of the petitioner to\nthe extent that product under consideration is styrene butadiene rubber\nof specified series as stated irrespective of custom heading. The\nAuthority thus holds that whereas it is not justified to cover all items\nfalling under the sub-heading 3903.90 for the purpose of imposing\nanti-dumping duty in present case the anti-dumping duty however is\npayable on Styrene Butadiene Rubber of specified series as stated\neven if it is sought to be cleared under any other heading of the\nCustom Tariff Act. The Custom Authority is at liberty and expected\nto classify the goods correct if the goods offered for clearance are\nnot classified correctly.\n\"\n(Emphasis supplied)\nThe findings recorded by the Designated Authority in para 7 of its\norder clearly indicate that the Designated Authority did not intend to cover\nG SBR which was being imported under sub-heading 3903.90 for the purpose\nof imposing duty; what the Designated Authority held was, that if the goods\nwere being imported by wrongly classifying them under sub-heading 4002.19,\nthen the Customs Authorities are at liberty and expected to classify the goods\ncorrectly. It was held by the Designated Authority that while giving the\nimport statistics. Respondent No.3 had submitted information in respect of\nH\nCustom Heading 4002.19 only; that Chapter 39 covers \"Plastic and Articles\nRISHIROOP POLYMERS PVT. LTD. 1. DESIGNATED AUTHORITY AND ADDI. SECTY. [BHAN, J.] 285\nB\nthereof\" whereas Chapter 40 covers \"Rubber and Articles thereof\" Styrene A\nButadiene Rubber, as the name suggests, is a synthetic rubber and would be\ncovered under Chapter 40 and not 39; that as per note no. 2(h) of Chapter\n39, synthetic rubbers and articles thereof, which are covered under Chapter\n40, do not fall under Chapter 39. The Designated Authority had recorded a\nfirm finding that “Elastomer Resin KHS 68” was not covered for the purpose\nof imposing duty. The finding recorded by the Designated Authority was\ncategorical and not a clerical omission, as has been observed by the Tribunal.\nIt was not correct on the part of the Tribunal to hold on its own motion that\n\"this is a clerical omission which is required to be corrected.\" Finding recorded\nby the Tribunal in this respect deserves to be set aside. We do so. Finding\nrecorded by the Designated Authority in this respect is restored.\nC\nDealing with the penultimate argument, it may be stated that the\nDesignated Authority had imposed the duty in rupee value but the Tribunal\nconverted the same in US dollar terms, without there being any prayer for\nsuch conversion by either of the parties. Learned counsel appearing for the\nDepartment conceded that the Tribunal was not justified in converting the D\nanti-dumping duty in US dollar terms and, after taking instructions, stated\nthat he has no objection to the setting aside of the order passed by the\nTribunal in imposing anti-dumping duty in terms of US dollars and to the\nrestoration of the order passed by the Designated Authority in imposing the\nanti-dumping duty in rupee terms.\nAccordingly, these appeals are allowed partly to the extent indicated\nabove. No costs.\nV.S.S.\nAppeals allowed.\n(I)\nE\n"}
