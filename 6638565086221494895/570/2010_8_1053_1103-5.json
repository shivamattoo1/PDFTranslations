In the light of the above discussion, we answer the A\nquestions as follows:\n(i) The trial court did not adopt the proper procedure while\nenforcing Section 89 of the Code. Failure to invoke\nSection 89 suo moto after completion of pleadings and\nconsidering it only after an application under Section 89\nwas filed, is erroneous.\n(ii) A civil court exercising power under Section 89 of the\nCode cannot refer a suit to arbitration unless all the parties\nto the suit agree for such reference.\n36. Consequently, this appeal is allowed and the order of\nthe trial court referring the matter to arbitration and the order\nof the High Court affirming the said reference are set aside.\nThe Trial Court will now consider and decide upon a non-\nadjudicatory ADR process.\nD.G.\nAppeal allowed.\nB\nC\nD\n"}
