When the deceased disclosed the fact about such harassment\nto her parents, her mother, PW3, took her along with her. However, brother\nof deceased had brought the deceased back to her husband's place. On the\nfateful day, mother-in-law of the deceased started a quarrel with her. She\nallegedly poured kerosene oil from the lamp on her, due to which she caught\nfire and suffered burn injuries. Her brother-in-law put out the fire by pouring\nwater. In the meantime, her husband had also come and the deceased was taken\nto a hospital. Hospital record indicated that she was brought to the hospital\nG with burn injuries on her body. Special Judicial Magistrate, PW5, was called\nby the police and dying declaration of the deceased was recorded by him.\nAccording to the dying declaration, she caught fire accidentally when came\ninto contact with the lamp and absolved all the inmates of her husband's family\nof any wrong-doing. On the next day, however, Special Judicial Magistrate,\nH\n354\nSAYARABANO@SULTANABEGUM v. STATE OF MAHARASHTRA\n355\nwas again called up for the purpose of recording dying declaration of deceased A\nsecond time. In the said dying declaration, she stated that her mother-in-law\nhad sprinkled kerosene oil on her and set her on fire with the result she\nsuffered burn injuries and also stated about her torturing by her mother-in-\nlaw, and at her instance, by her husband. Later, she succumbed to the burn\ninjuries. On the basis of the second dying declaration recorded by the Special\nJudicial Magistrate, a case was registered against the mother-in-law of the\ndeceased. Initially, the case was registered for an offence punishable under\nSection 307 IPC but after her death, it was converted into an offence\npunishable under Section 302 IPC and mother-in-law of the deceased was\narr√©sted. The matter was committed to the Court of Sessions and charges\nwere framed against the accused under Section 302 IPC.\nB\nC\nThe Trial Court observed that it was true that in the first dying\ndeclaration the deceased did not involve her mother-in-law, but it was because\nof the fact that she was asked by her mother-in-law not to implicate any member\nof the family of her in-laws. The Trial Court noted that after recording of the\nfirst dying declaration, the parents and inmates of deceased had reached the D\nhospital. The deceased could get courage to state true facts and again the\nSpecial Judicial Magistrate was called and the second dying declaration was\nrecorded in which she disclosed true and correct facts. The Trial Court held\nthe conduct of deceased as natural and the second dying declaration reliable\nwhich could be treated as basis for holding the appellant guilty for committing\nthe offence punishable under Section 302 IPC and sentenced her accordingly.\nAppeal preferred against the order of the Trial Court was dismissed by the\nHigh Court. Hence the present appeal.\nE\nAccused-appellant contended that both the Courts below have committed\nan error of law in relying upon the second dying declaration; that the first F\ndying declaration was correct and the deceased had stated true facts in the\nsaid declaration; that after parents of the deceased had come to the hospital,\nthey persuaded the deceased to involve and implicate the appellant and that is\nhow the second dying declaration was recorded which could not have been\nrelied upon; and that no motive was established by the prosecution.\nDismissing the appeal, the Court\nHELD: 1. The Trial Court as well as the High Court considered both\nthe dying declarations of the deceased and both the Courts held the second\ndying declaration true and inspiring confidence having disclosed true facts\nso far as the incident was concerned. Ill-treatment towards the deceased was\nG\nH\n356\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS [2007] 2 S.C.R.\nA clearly established and completely proved. The evidence of PW2-father as well\nas PW3-mother of the deceased was clinching on the point. Both the Courts\nwere right in holding that nothing could be elicited from the cross-examination\nof those witnesses. It, therefore, cannot successfully be contended that the\nonly cause of throwing burning lamp on the deceased by the appellant was\ngetting up late in the morning by the deceased and not performing Namaz.\nEven prior to that incident, the appellant used to beat the deceased and on the\nfateful day, it was an excuse to kill the daughter-in-law by the mother-in-law.\n[Para 14] [361-F-H; 362-A]\nB\n2. Criminal cases are decided on facts and on evidence rather than on\nC case law and precedents. In the case on hand, there is ample evidence to show\nthat even prior to the incident in question, the appellant used to beat the\ndeceased and ill-treat her. It is in the light of the said fact that other evidence\nrequires to be considered. Both the Courts were right in relying upon the\nsecond dying declaration of the deceased treating it as true disclosure of facts\nby the deceased. In the light of the evidence of parents of the deceased (PW2\nD and PW3), Doctor (PW6) and Special Judicial Magistrate (PW5), it cannot\nbe said that the Courts below had committed any error and the conviction\ndeserves to be set aside.

This appeal is filed by the appellant who was\nconvicted by the Sessions Judge, Beed in Sessions Case No. 17 of 1999\ndecided on July 25, 2000 and confirmed by the High Court of Judicature at\nBombay (Aurangabad Bench) on October 17, 2005 in Criminal Appeal No. 348\nof 2000 for an offence punishable under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code\n('IPC' for short).\nr\nSAYARABANO @SULTANABEGUM 1. STATE OF MAHARASHTRA [THAKKER, J.] 357\n2. The prosecution case against the appellant was that Halimabi, daughter A\nof PW 2-Shaikh Bademiyan, resident of Mandula, Taluka Georai was married\nto one Shaikh Latif of Beed one year prior to the incident which took place\non August 13, 1998. After the marriage, the deceased Halimabi came to reside\nat her matrimonial home situated at Mominpura of village Beed. She was\nresiding in the said house with her husband Shaikh Latif, the appellant-\naccused Sayarabano-her mother-in-law, Shaikh Rafiq-her father-in-law, Shaikh\nShakil-her younger brother-in-law and his wife Taslim.\nB\n3. According to the prosecution case, the deceased Halimabi was being\nill-treated by her mother-in-law-appellant herein. At the instance of the appellant,\nhusband of the deceased Halimabi used to beat her. About a month prior to C\nthe incident, the accused had beaten the deceased on two occasions, once\nwith a stick and again with a steel instrument. The deceased disclosed the\nfact about the said beating to her parents as well as her uncle. Resultantly,\nPW3-Bismillahbi-mother of the deceased Halimabi had come to Beed and had\ntaken deceased to her house at Mandula. About eight days prior to the\nincident, the brother of deceased Halimabi had again brought the deceased D\nback to her husband's place and had returned to the village.\nE\n4. On August 13, 1998, the appellant-accused started a quarrel with the\ndeceased Halimabi and abused her over the fact that she had not got up early\nin the morning for Namaz. At that time, the deceased Halimabi was standing\nat a place where a burning lamp was hung on the nail in the wall. The husband\nas well as father-in-law of the deceased had gone to the Masjid for Namaz.\nIn the house, apart from the deceased and the appellant-accused, brother-in-\nlaw of the deceased-Shaikh Shakil and his wife Taslim were present. During\nthe course of quarrel, the appellant-accused poured kerosene from the lamp\non the deceased, due to which, the deceased caught fire and suffered burn F\ninjuries on her back, stomach and breast. She started screaming in pain. Her\nbrother-in-law Shaikh Shakil put out the fire by pouring water and removed\nher clothes. Meanwhile, her husband had come and the deceased was taken\nto hospital.\n5. The record indicates that when Halimabi was brought to the hospital, G\nthe history recorded accidental burns. She was taken to the hospital at 10.30\na.m. on August 13, 1998. Between 1.30 and 1.50 p.m. on the same day, Abdul\nRashid Special Judicial Magistrate. Beed (PW5) was called by the police and\ndying declaration of deceased Halimabi was recorded by him. In that dying\ndeclaration, deceased Halimabi stated that while opening the door, her hand\nH\n358\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS [2007] 2 S.C.R.\nX\n.\nB\nA hit the kerosene lamp which was kept on the pillow and fell on her and she\nsustained injuries. In other words, according to the said dying declaration, the\ndeceased caught fire accidentally when she came into contact with the lamp.\nShe absolved all the inmates of her husband's family of any wrong-doing or\nconnecting with her catching fire. On the next day i.e., on August 14, 1998,\nat about 1.45 p.m., however, again PW5-Special Judicial Magistrate was called\nfor the purpose of recording dying declaration of deceased Halimabi. In the\nsaid dying declaration, she stated that on the previous day i.e. on August\n13, 1998, her mother-in-law (appellant) started abusing her for not going for\nNamaz by getting up late. At that time, in the house, kerosene lamp was hung\non the wall near which the deceased was standing. Her husband as well as\nC her father-in-law had gone for Namaz and in the house, deceased Halimabi,\nher mother-in-law (appellant), her sister-in-law Taslim and her brother-in-law\nShaikh Shakil were present. According to the deceased, her mother-in-law\n(appellant) threw the kerosene lamp on her, with the result both of her hands,\nentire back, stomach and both sides of her chest were burnt and she started\nscreaming and crying. Her brother-in-law Shaikh Shakil poured water on her\nand extinguished fire and removed her clothes. She was then taken to the\nhospital. She also stated that her marriage took place before 8 to 10 months\nand had no child. Her husband used to beat after listening to his mother. She\nwas asked to do entire household work. In case she did not do work, her\nmother-in-law used to abuse her.\nD\nE\n6. In the light of the fact that in the previous dying declaration, the\ndeceased had not involved her mother-in-law and had described the incident\nas 'accidental', the Special Judicial Magistrate asked the deceased that when\nhe recorded her dying declaration on August 13, 1998, in the said statement,\nthe deceased had stated that she was hit by the kerosene lamp which fell on\nF her and she was burnt. The Special Judicial Magistrate, therefore, asked her\nas to why she was changing her statement. The deceased replied that her\nmother-in-law (appellant) told her not to give any statement against the family\nmembers of her in-laws and that was the reason why she had given the earlier\nstatement. But in fact, it was her mother-in-law who threw kerosene lamp on\nher and thus she was burnt. She also stated that her mother-in-law was\nG\nharassing her.\n7. Ultimately, Halimabi died on August 20, 1998 at about 7.00 p.m. On\nthe basis of the second dying declaration recorded by the Special Judicial\nMagistrate, a case was registered by PW7PS! Sampat Shinde under C.R.\nH No.60 of 1998 at Peth-Beed Police Station. Initially, the case was registered\nSAYARABANO@SULTANABEGUM v. STATE OF MAHARASHTRA [THAKKER, J.] 359\nfor an offence punishable under Section 307 IPC but after the death of A\nHalimabi it was converted into an offence punishable under Section 302 IPC.\nThe appellant was arrested on August 15, 1998. The matter was committed\nto the Court of Session and a charge was framed against the accused under\nSection 302 IPC.\n8. To establish the case against the appellant, the prosecution inter alia B\nexamined PW1-Kisan Masruti Golhar, Medical Officer, Civil Hospital, Beed,\nPW2 -Bademiyafather of the deceased, PW3-Bismillabi-mother of the deceased,\nPW5-Abdul Rashid, Special Judicial Magistrate, Beed, PW6-Dr. Kirshore\nSirpurkar, PW7-PSI Sampat Shinde. The case of the appellant was of total\ndenial.\nC\nE\n9. The Trial Court, on the basis of medical evidence held that death of\nHalimabi was homicidal. As to the culpability of the accused for an offence\nunder Section 302, the Court held that in the light of the evidence of father\nand mother of deceased Halimabi, it was clearly established that the appellant-\nmother-in-law of the deceased was harassing Halimabi. The Trial Court also D\nobserved that it was true that in the first dying declaration, on August 13,\n1998, the deceased did not involve her mother-in-law but it was because of\nthe fact that she was asked by her mother-in-law not to implicate any member\nof the family of the appellant. The Trial Court noted that after the first dying\ndeclaration was recorded, the parents and inmates of deceased Halimabi had\nreached the hospital. The deceased could get courage to state true facts and\nagain the Special Judicial Magistrate was called and the second dying\ndeclaration was recorded on August 14, 1998 in which she disclosed true and\ncorrect facts. The Trial Court also noted that the Special Judicial Magistrate\nwas conscious of the fact that in the first dying declaration, she had not\ninvolved any family members of her in-laws. A specific question was, therefore, F\nput by him as to the reason why she had done so and the deceased had\nreplied that it was because of her mother-in-law who asked the deceased to\ndo so. The Trial Court, therefore, held the conduct of deceased Halimabi as\nnatural and the second dying declaration reliable which could be treated as\nbasis for holding the appellant guilty. The Trial Court also observed that from\nthe evidence of PW2-father of the deceased and PW3-mother of the deceased, G\nit was proved that Halimabi was ill-treated by her in-laws, and particularly the\nappellant-mother-in-law. The Court also observed that PW5-Abdul Rashid\n(Special Judicial Magistrate) had no axe to grind against the appellant. PW5\nstated that on being questioned, Halimabi stated on August 14, 1998 that she\nwas burnt by her mother-in-law (appellant) by throwing burning kerosene H\n360\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS [2007] 2 S.C.R.\nA lamp on her but she had not stated so in the previous dying declaration\nbecause of the insistence of her mother-in-law. On the basis of evidence of\nparents of deceased Halimabi and the second drying declaration, the Trial\nCourt convicted the appellant.\n10. The appellant preferred an appeal and the High Court confirmed the\nB decision of the Trial Court observing that on August 13, 1998, Halimabi could\nnot name her mother-in-law (appellant) as the deceased Halimabi was brought\nto hospital by her in-laws; viz. the accused-mother-in-law and her sons. But,\non the next day, she was in a position to state correct fact and on being\nsatisfied about her physical condition as stated by PW6-Dr. Kishore, PW5-\nAbdul Rashid (Special Judicial Magistrate) again recorded the dying declaration\nwhich inspired confidence. Accordingly, the High Court dismissed the appeal\nfiled by the appellant. The appellant has come to this Court against the said\norder.\nC\nD\n11. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties.\n12. The learned counsel for the appellant contended that both the\nCourts have committed an error of law in relying upon the second dying\ndeclaration. It was contended that the first dying declaration was correct and\nthe deceased had stated true facts in the said declaration. It was also stated\nthat after parents of the deceased had come to the hospital, they had persuaded\nE the deceased to involve and implicate the appellant and that is how the\nsecond dying declaration was recorded which could not have been relied\nupon. It was also submitted that no motive was established by the prosecution\ninasmuch as only thing stated by the deceased in her dying declaration was\nthat she had got up late in the morning and could not go for Namaz. For such\na trivial matter, no person would kill another person. It was, therefore, submitted\nthat the appeal deserves to be allowed by setting aside the order passed by\nthe Trial Court and confirmed by the High Court.\nF\n13. The Pubic Prosecutor for the State, on the other hand, supported\nthe order of conviction and sentence passed by the Trial Court and confirmed\nG by the High Court. He submitted that the conduct of the deceased Halimabi\nwas natural. She was believed by both the Courts. It was obvious that on\nAugust 13, 1998, she was pressurised by her mother-in-law for not giving\nname of her assailant. Moreover, she was surrounded by her in-laws and\nnobody from her parental family was present. It was only after her family\nmembers had come that she got courage to narrate true facts and that is how\non August 14, 1998, second dying declaration was given by her which\nH\nSAYARABANO@SULTANABEGUM 1. STATE OF MAHARASHTRA [THAKKER, J.) 361\ninspired confidence and both the Courts believed it. It was also submitted A\nthat from the evidence of parents of the deceased, it was clearly proved that\nshe was ill-treated and was frequently beaten by the appellant. Instances were\nalso cited which went to show that the appellant was cruel to the deceased.\nThe counsel also stated that both the Courts were right in observing that\nSpecial Judicial Magistrate was an independent witness and when on the\nB\nbasis of his evidence, a finding of guilt of the appellant was recorded, no\ninterference is called for. He, therefore, submitted that the appeal be dismissed.\nC\n(I)\nE\n14. Having heard the learned counsel for the parties, in our opinion, the\nCourts below were right in convicting the appellant. From the evidence, it is\nproved that on August 13, 1998, after the incident took place, the family\nmembers of the appellant took the deceased to the hospital. The record\nrevealed that before few days of the incident, the deceased had been brought\nto her marital home. Before that, she was beaten by the appellant. She left\nmarital home and went to parental home. It is also in the evidence that the\ndeceased was beaten by her mother-in-law and two instances had been cited.\nObviously, therefore, on August 13, 1998, when the deceased was taken to D\nhospital by her mother-in-law-appellant, who insisted not to give the name of\nany of the family members of the appellant, the deceased had no courage to\nname her. In the circumstances, she stated that it was merely an accident. But,\nafter her parents came, she could state true facts, the Special Judicial Magistrate\nwas called again and the second dying declaration was recorded. From the\nevidence of PW1-Dr. Kishan-Medical Officer, it was clear that total burns were\nabout 57%. It is also in evidence of PW6-Dr. Kishore that the deceased was\n\"in a position to make statement\". He, therefore, accompanied Special Judicial\nMagistrate to the ward of Halimabi and her dying declaration was recorded.\nHe also stated that he was present throughout till the statement of Halimabi\nwas recorded by the Special Judicial Magistrate and when it was over, he put F\nendorsement on the paper given by Special Judicial Magistrate. The Trial\nCourt as well as the High Court considered both the dying declarations of\nthe deceased Halimabi and both the Courts held the second dying declaration\ntrue and inspiring confidence having disclosed true facts so far as the incident\nwas concerned. Ill-treatment towards the deceased was clearly established\nand completely proved. The evidence of PW2-father as well as PW3-mother\nof the deceased was clinching on the point. Both the Courts were right in\nholding that nothing could be elicited from the cross-examination of those\nwitnesses. It, therefore, cannot successfully be contended that the only cause\nof throwing burning lamp on the deceased by the appellant was getting up\nlate in the morning by the deceased and not performing Namaz. Even prior H\nG\nT\n362\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS [2007] 2 S.C.R.\nA to that incident, the appellant used to beat the deceased and on the fateful\nday, it was an excuse to kill the daughter-in-law by the mother-in-law.\n15. The learned counsel for the appellant strongly relied upon a decision\nof this Court in Lella Srinivasa Rao v. State of A.P., [2004] 9 SCC 713. In that\ncase, the sole basis for recording the conviction was dying declarations. Two\nB dying declarations were recorded which were inconsistent. In absence of any\nother evidence, this Court held that it was not safe to act only on inconsistent\ndying declarations and convict the accused.\nC\n16. In our opinion, criminal cases are decided on facts and on evidence\nrather than on case law and precedents. In the case on hand, there is ample\nevidence to show that even prior to the incident in question, the appellant\nused to beat the deceased and ill-treat her. It is in the light of the said fact\nthat other evidence requires to be considered. In our view, both the Courts\nwere right in relying upon the second dying declaration of the deceased\ntreating it as true disclosure of facts by the deceased Halimabi. In the light\nD of the evidence of parents of the deceased (PW2 and PW3), Dr. Kishore\n(PW6) and Special Judicial Magistrate (PW5), it cannot be said that the\nCourts below had committed any error and the conviction deserves to be set\naside.\n17. For the foregoing reasons, in our opinion, the appeal deserves to\nE be dismissed and is accordingly dismissed.\nS.K.S.\nAppeal dismissed.\nMy\n"}
