BOMBAY CATHOLIC CO-OP\nHOUSING SOC. LTD. [JAGDISH SINGH KHEHAR, J.]\n907\nprayer was, that the Catholic Society should be restrained from A\ntaking steps in furtherance of the resolution passed by the\nCatholic Society dated 6.12.2009 (as also, the consequential\nconveyance deed dated 7.12.2009).\n24. In order to understand the nature of relief, sought by\nthe tenant-members in the civil suits filed by them, it would be\nappropriate to extract hereunder the prayers made in Suit\nno.144 of 2010:\n\"The plaintiffs therefore pray:\n(a) for a declaration that the said Resolution dated 6th\nDecember, 2009 (Exhibit 'K' hereto) and the said\nConveyance dated 7th December, 2009 (Exhibit 'M'\nhereto) are invalid, illegal and void ab initio and/or the\nsame are voidable as against the plaintiffs and the Tenant\nmembers of Defendant No.17 Association. That this\nHon'ble Court be pleased to pass order declaring section\n164 of Maharashtra Co-operative Societies Act, as\nviolation of Article 14 of the Constitution of India and the\nsame ought to be struck down;\n(b) for a Judgment and Decree directing Defendant No.20\nherein to deliver up the Conveyance dated 7th December,\n2009 Exhibit 'M' hereto for cancellation;\nB\nс\nD\nE\nLL\nF\n(c) that, pending the hearing and final disposal of the\npresent suit, this Hon'ble Court be pleased to issue an\nOrder and Injunction restraining the Defendant Nos.1 to 17\nand Defendant No.20 from taking any steps in furtherance\nof the said purported Resolution dated 6th December,\n2009 and/or Conveyance dated 7th December, 2009. (ii) G.\nto issue an Order and Injunction directing Defendant Nos.1\nto 16 to deposit in this Hon'ble Court the sum of Rs.70\ncrores received from Defendant No.20 under the\nResolution dated 6th December, 2009 and under the\nConveyance dated 7th December, 2009;\nH\n908\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2013] 5 S.C.R.\nA\nB\n(d) for ad-interim reliefs in terms of prayer clause (c) above;\n(e) for the costs of the present suit;\n(f) for such other and further reliefs as the nature and\ncircumstances of the present case may require.\"\nSince the interim prayers, as had been sought in the suits filed\nby the tenant-members, were not granted to them, they\npreferred Notice of Motion no. 172 of 2010 (arising out of Suit\nno.144 of 2010) before the High Court. By an order dated\nC 11.1.2010, a learned Single Judge of the High Court found\nfavour with the prayer made by the tenant-members. The\noperative part of the order granting interim relief to the tenant-\nmembers is being extracted hereunder:\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n\"47. Resultantly the following ad-interim order:\n(i)\n(ii)\nORDER\nNo further steps be taken by the concerned parties\nbased upon the Conveyance dated 07/12/2009.\nThe parties to maintain status-quo with respect to\nthe property in question i.e., Willingdon East.\n(iii) The earlier statements already recorded in the\norder dated 24th December, 2009 to continue till\nfurther order.\n(iv)\n(v)\nReply/rejoinder, if any to be filed within two weeks.\nS.O. to 25/1/2010, for hearing. However, the liberty\nis granted to the parties to settle the matter also.\n48. The learned counsel Mr.Chetan Kapadia, appearing\nfor some of the Defendants, makes statement that 18\ntenant/members have already surrendered possession\nand the tenancy to defendant No.72. However, in view of\nthe above common order, it is made clear that parties to\nMARGARET ALMEIDA v. BOMBAY CATHOLIC CO-OP\nHOUSING SOC. LTD. [JAGDISH SINGH KHEHAR, J.]\n909\nmaintain status-quo will cover any further steps to these\nsuits.\"\nA\nIt would also be relevant to mention that the High Court also\npassed a common order dated 5.5.2011 in Writ Petition\nno.1769 of 2010, Chamber Summons no.748 of 2011 and\nNotice of Motion no.172 of 2010 (arising out of Suit no.144 of\n2010) and in Suit no.144 of 2010. Thereby, the Notice of\nMotion was disposed of by making absolute the interim order\nearlier granted (on 11.1.2010) in favour of the tenant-members.\nRelevant extract of the order dated 5.5.2011 in the aforesaid\nmatters is being reproduced hereunder:\nB\nC\n\"112. In the circumstances, the Notice of Motion is\ndisposed of by making the same absolute in terms of\nprayer (a)(i) and by directing all the parties to maintain\nstatus quo in respect of the suit property pending the D\nhearing and final disposal of the suit. There, however, shall\nbe no order as to costs.\"\nF\nEven though the controversy, in the manner in which it has been\ndealt with hereinabove, seems to be in the nature of final E\ndetermination between the parties, yet the instant order, is only\na determination of the validity of the interim relief sought by the\ntenant-members. In so far as the instant aspect of the matter\nis concerned, it would be relevant to mention, that the order\nextracted above, dated 5.5.2011, was assailed by the Catholic\nSociety before a Division Bench of the High Court by filing\nAppeal no.413 of 2011 (in Notice of Motion no. 172 of 2010, in\nSuit no.144 of 2010). The aforesaid appeal was disposed of\nby a Division Bench of the High Court on 7.9.2012. By the\naforesaid order, the interim protection afforded to the tenant-\nmembers on 5.5.2001, by a learned Single Judge of the High\nCourt, was ordered to be vacated. It is the instant order dated\n7.9.2012, which is the subject matter of challenge (at the hands.\nof the tenant-members), before us.\nG\n25. While adjudicating upon the controversy in hand, and H\n910\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2013] 5 S.C.R.\nA while determining the validity of the impugned order passed by\nthe Division Bench of the High Court dated 7.9.2012, we shall\napply ourselves to issues relevant for granting or denying interim\nprayers, while disposing of the instant appeals.\nB\nC\nD\n26. As noticed above, the Catholic Society comprises of\nabout 745 members. Out of these members there were\noriginally 54 tenant-members and 15 tenants simplicitor (the\ntenants simplicitor, were not members of the Catholic Society).\nAfter the coming into force of the Cooperative Societies Act,\nall the tenants (including the tenant-members, as also, the\ntenants simplicitor) became members of the Catholic Society.\nIt is therefore, that the strength of the tenant-members at the\npresent juncture is 69. The relief sought in the two suits (i.e. Suit\nno.144 of 2010 and Suit no. 145 of 2010) is a claim for rights,on\naccount of being tenant-members. It is important to point out,\nthat the aforesaid suits were filed by only 15 tenant-members.\nIt is these 15 tenant-members, who had pursued their prayer\nfor interim relief, before the High Court. It is not a matter of\ndispute, that the suits referred to above, were not filed in a\nrepresentative capacity, and as such, it would be incorrect to\nE assume, that the aforesaid suits can be considered to have\nbeen filed by all the 69 tenant-members. The correct factual\nposition is, that out of 69 tenant-members only 15 tenant-\nmembers had filed the aforesaid suits. The number of tenant-\nmembers who were pursuing their remedy through the\nF aforesaid suits, has diminished further before this Court,\ninasmuch as Special Leave Petition (C) nos.30847-49 of 2012\ncomprises of 8 petitioners only. It is therefore apparent, that 7\nof the plaintiffs in the suits, have now not joined hands with\nthose who have approached this Court, (and are now\nG appellants, before this Court). The instant factual narration\nhowever proceeds further, inasmuch as, IA nos. 17-19 of 2012\n(arising out of SLP (C) nos.30847-49 of 2012) have been filed\nby three of the petitioners (now appellants) i.e., petitioner/\nappellant nos.2, 3 and 4, i.e., Jennifer Pegado, Elwyn D'cruz\nand Don Donato D'Silva, with a prayer for transposing them\nH\n"}
