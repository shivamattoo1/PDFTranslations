The B\nrequirement of the order made by the authority indicating\non the face of it that the authority has applied its mind to\nthe opinion submitted by the federation, will have to read\ninto the provisions in order to make the requirement of\nconsultation effective and meaningful. In the present case,\nadmittedly, the opinion expressed by the federation has not\nbeen considered by the Deputy Registrar while deciding\nto make the order of bifurcation. It therefore, suffers from\nviolation of mandatory requirement of consultation with the\nfederal society, and therefore, we have no alternative but\nto set aside that order. But because the proposal had been\nsubmitted as far back as in the year 1979 and the final\ndecision in that regard has not yet been taken, we propose\nto issue directions to the authority so that a decision can\nbe made by the authority as expeditiously as possible.\nC\nD\nE\n5. In the result, therefore, the appeal succeeds and is\nallowed.

The orders passed by\nthe Authorities under the Maharashtra Co-operative F\nSocieties Act and the learned Single Judge confirming that\norder are also set aside.

In compliance with the directions issued by the\nDivision Bench of the High Court on 4.8.2007, the issue of\nbifurcation of the Catholic Society came to be placed before\nthe Deputy Registrar, Co-operative Societies, Mumbai.

The Catholic Society raised a challenge to the order\npassed by the Deputy Registrar, Co-operative Societies, C\nMumbai, by filing an appeal before the Joint Registrar, Co-\noperative Societies, Mumbai. In fact, a separate appeal was\nalso filed by the tenant-members to assail the order passed by\nthe Deputy Registrar, Co-operative Societies dated\n28.11.2007. The Divisional Joint Registrar, Co-operative D\nSocieties, Mumbai disposed of appeal no.246 of 2007 (filed\nby the Catholic Society) and Appeal no.27 of 2008 (filed by the\ntenant-members) by a common order dated 29.9.2009.

All the same, yet again, the issue of\nbifurcation was remanded back for redetermination at the\nhands of the Deputy Registrar, Co-operative Societies,\nMumbai.\nD\nE\nF\nG\n21. It would be pertinent to mention, that a challenge to the\nappellate order passed by the Divisional Joint Registrar, Co-\noperative Societies, Mumbai, is permissible through a revision\npetition before the competent authority of the State\nGovernment. The tenant-members availed of the aforesaid\nremedy and by preferring Revision Application no.713 of 2009\nbefore the State Government, wherein the aforesaid order\ndated 29.9.2009 passed by the Divisional Joint Registrar, Co-\noperative Societies, Mumbai was assailed. It is however,\nrelevant to notice, that the aforesaid challenge raised by the\ntenant-members, through the aforesaid revision petition was\nwithdrawn.

In sum and substance, therefore, the State\nGovernment disposed of the revision petition by quashing the\nbifurcation proceedings. The order passed by the State\nGovernment dated 6.12.2009, brought to an end the claim\nraised by the tenant-members under Section 18 of the Co-\noperative Societies Act, praying for the bifurcation of the\nCatholic Society, with reference to the property known as\nWillingdon East.\nD\nE\nF\n22.
