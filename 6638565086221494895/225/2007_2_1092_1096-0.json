Bharat Singh, [2002] 6 Supreme Court 336, referred to.\nCIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION : Civil Appeal No. 896 of 2007.\nFrom the Judgment and final Order dated 3.5.2006 of the High Court of\nJudicature for Rajasthan at Jaipur Bench, Jaipur in SB Sales Tax Revision\nPetition No. 12 of 2006.\nSushil Kumar Jain, Puneet Jain, Chrishti Jain, Sarad Singhania, H.D.\nThanvi and Rani Maheshwari for the Appellant.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nDR. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. 1. Leave granted.\n2. Challenge in this appeal is to the order passed by a learned Single\nJudge of the Rajasthan High Court at Jaipur. By the impugned order the High\nCourt dismissed the revision petition, filed by the appellant, and imposed cost\nof Rs.5,000/- to be paid personally by the Commercial Tax Officer, Anti Evasion,\nBharatpur who passed the assessment order dated 14.9.2001.\n3. Background facts in a nutshell are as follows:\nPenalty under Section 78(5) of the Rajasthan Sales Tax Act, 1994\n(hereinafter referred to as the 'Act') was imposed on the respondent (hereinafter\nreferred to as the ‘assessee') on the ground that at the time of checking of\nvehicle on 7.9.2001, the documents produced showed that bill No.155 dated\n29.9.2000 of M/s. Georg Fischer Disa Limited, Satyamangala Industrial Area,\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n1094\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 2 S.C.R.\nA Tumkur, Karnataka raised on the respondent-assessee M/s. Amtek India Ltd.,\nBiwadi along with delivery challan No. 5259 dated 3.9.2001 form No. ST-18A\nin which invoice No.155 was also mentioned and form No.ST -39 prescribed\nunder Karnataka Sales Tax Act and bilty of North Eastern Carrying Corporation\naccompanying the said goods were produced for verification. However, date\nof the said invoice No. 155 dated 16.2.2000, was held to be of an earlier point\nof time than the date mentioned in the delivery challan of 3.9.2001. Therefore,\nthe Assessing Authority held that said document was doubtful and there was\nnon-compliance with Section 78(2)(a) of the Act, and imposed the penalty of\nRs. 1,36,200/- @30% of value of goods on the respondent-assessee, the\nconsignee or purchaser.\nB\nC\nᎠ\n4. According to the assessee, plant and machinery and equipments\npurchased by respondent-assessee from the consignor though purchased\nunder invoice No.155 dated 16.2.2000 in which due excise duty and Central\nSales Tax @ 4% against C-Form was charged by the seller, but the goods were\nconsigned and received after the lapse of about one year.\n5. But that cannot mean that invoice raised by seller-company was not\ngenuine and, therefore, the penalty was not justified.\n6. Both the Appellate Authorities i.e. D.C. (Appeals) as well as Tax\nBoard found the said explanation of the assessee satisfactory and correct\nE and, therefore, set aside the penalty under Sec. 78(5) of the Act. The revenue\nF\nfiled a revision petition before the High Court under Section 86 of the Act\non the supposed question of law arising in the matter. The High Court found\nthat as a matter of fact none arises.\n7. In the Revision Petition filed, the correctness of views expressed by\nthe Appellate Authority i.e. the DC (Appeals) and the Tax Board were\nquestioned. The High Court found that all relevant documents were produced,\nthe declarations issued by the Sales Tax Authorities of both the States clearly\nestablished that transit and transactions were perfectly genuine and there was\nno reason for the Assessing Authority to hold the document to be non-\nG genuine so as to attract levy of penalty at the rate of 30% of the value of\ngoods under Section 38(5) of the Act. The High Court felt that the action of\nthe authorities cannot be countenanced and they cannot take the plea of\ngood faith. The alleged good faith was not established and on the contrary\nthe action clearly indicated that the assessing officer was bent upon levying\nthe demand overlooking the genuine documents. Accordingly, the revision\nH\nASSISTANT COMMNR. ANTI EVASION COMMERCIAL TAXES. BHARATPUR v. AMTEK INDIA LTD. ĮPASAYAT. J. 1095\npetition was dismissed and costs were imposed.\n8. Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that an error of judgment\nshould not be treated as a mala fide action so as to warrant the severe\ncriticism as done by the High Court and also to warrant imposition of cost.\nA\n9. There is no appearance on behalf of the respondent in spite of notice. B\n10. Whether an act has been done in good faith would depend upon\nthe factual scenario. In order to establish \"good faith\", it has to be established\nthat what has been imputed concerning the person claiming it to be so, is true.\n11. “Good Faith” according to the definition in Section 3(22) of the C\nGeneral Clauses Act, 1897 means a thing, which is in fact done honestly\nwhether it is done negligently or not.\n12. Anything done with due care and attention, which is not mala fide\nis presumed to have been done in 'good faith'.\n13. \"Good Faith” is defined under Section 2(h) of the Limitation Act, as\n'good faith' nothing shall be deemed to be done in good faith which is not\ndone with due care and attention\"\n14. Dealing with a case under the Indian Limitation Act, 1963, this Court\nD\nheld that the expression 'good faith' as used in Section 14 means “exercise E\nof due care and attention”. In the context of Section 14, the expression 'good\nfaith' qualifies prosecuting the proceeding in the court, which ultimately is\nfound to have no jurisdiction. The finding as to good faith or the absence\nof it is a finding of fact. [See Deena v. Bharat Singh, [2002] 6 SC 336]\n15. Section 52 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short 'IPC') emphasizes\ndue care and attention in relation to \"good faith\".\n16. In this case though the action of the concerned assessing officer,\nin overlooking the documents produced coming to the conclusion about\nmanipulation appears to be totally uncalled for and without any reasonable\nbasis. This is a case where the officer should have been more careful and\nshould not have acted in a manner as if he was a bloodhound and not a\nwatchdog of revenue. It is unfortunate that in large number of cases, orders\ntotally bereft of rationality are being passed. They do not in any manner serve\npublic interest, much less the interest of revenue.\nF\nG\nH\n1096\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 2 S.C.R.\nA\nB\n17. Therefore, while holding that the action of the Assessing Authority\nwas clearly unjustified, we direct deletion of the direction for imposition of\ncost. We, however, make it clear that in future if any such action comes to\nthe notice of the Courts/Authorities, appropriate action shall be taken in\naccordance with law and the observations made in this case about lack of\nbona fide shall also be a factor to be taken note of.\nN.J.\n18. The appeal is accordingly disposed of.\nAppeal disposed of.\nL\n"}
