These two connected appeals have been\nfiled against the impugned judgment of the Allahabad High Court dated\n14.12.2005 in Government Appeal No.2083 of 1981.\n2. Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record.\n3. The incident in question took place on the night of 28/29th March,\n1980 in village Gaayghat, Police Station Kalwari, District Basti. There were\nfour accused in the case. The appellants Ram Charittar and Kishori Lal, who\nare the brothers of one Ram Chet, are two of the accused.

[MARKANDEY KATJU, J.] 775\nacid on them.\ni\n4. The trial court acquitted all the accused by its judgment dated\n12.5.1981 but in appeal the High Court convicted the appellants Ram Charittar\nand Kishori Lal under Section 302/34 IPC, and sentenced them to life\nimprisonment, but gave the benefit of doubt to the other co-accused Ram\nKumar and Chandrawati and thus affirmed their acquittal.\n5. We have carefully gone through the material on record. It is alleged\nthat the motive for killing Sushila and her children was to grab her property.\nA\nB\n6. The prosecution case is that in between the eventful night at about\n3 o'clock, cries and shrieks emanating from the house of Sushila attracted her C\nneighbours Bhagwati PW-2, Ram Din PW-3, Mangroo PW-4, Prem Narain\nPW-5 and several others to the scene. They saw the accused Ram Charittar,\nKishori Lal, Ram Kumar and Chandrawati coming out of the house of the\ndeceased which was near their own houses. Ram Charittar had in his hand\na bottle of acid. Seeing the witnesses, Ram Charittar dropped the bottle of\nD\nacid in the verandah of the deceased. The bottle was broken and the acid\nsplashed on the floor. The witnesses succeeded in apprehending the accused\nRam Charittar, Kishori Lal and Chandrawati at the spot, but Ram Kumar made\ngood his escape. Ram Charittar applied some acid to his face and some acid\nfell on the face of his wife accused Chandrawati. In the meantime, Sushila\ncame out with her younger daughter Nandini rolling on the floor and both of E\nthem died near her door. Bindu elder daughter of Sushila was also badly burnt\nwith acid. While crying she said that 'Badka Dada' had thrown acid on them.\nBeing badly burnt with acid she was taken to the District Hospital, where she\ndied.\n7. The post mortem report of the deceased shows that there are acid\nburn injuries on large parts of their bodies including their face, chest, neck,\netc. According to the Doctor the death was due to the corrosive acid burns\nand shock.\nF\n8. Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that there were no eye- G\nwitnesses to the incident. It is true that there were no eye-witnesses to the\nincident but there were as many as four witnesses being Bhagwati PW-2, Ram\nDin PW-3, Mangroo PW-4, Prem Narain PW-5, who have stated in their\nevidence that they saw the accused coming out of the house of Sushila. The\nappellant Ram Charittar had an acid bottle in his hand. These witnesses and\nother people got hold of Ram Charittar, Kishori Lal and Chandrawati but Ram H\n776\nA Kumar fled away.\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 4 S.C.R.\n9. The evidence of these four witnesses is consistent. Thus there is\nstrong circumstantial evidence against the appellants. We see no reason to\ndisbelieve these evidences and hence we agree with the view taken by the\nHigh Court. The medical evidence corroborates the evidence of these witnesses\nB and there is also the dying declaration of Bindu the elder daughter of Sushila.\nC\n10. In the present case, there was strong motive for the accused to\nliquidate the deceased to grab the property. On killing them the accused\nbecame the immediate beneficiary to the estate left by the husband of deceased\nSushila. No enmity with the accused could be proved by the evidence against\nthe witnesses, and hence we agree with the High Court that some minor\ncontradictions will not shake their testimony. Thus we dismiss the appeal of\nRam Charittar and Kishori Lal.\nh\n11. As regards the State's appeal against the acquittal of Ram Kumar\nD\nand Chandrawati, the High Court has given these accused the benefit of\ndoubt. We see no reason to disagree with the view taken by the High Court.\nE\nR.P.\n12. Thus, there is no force in both these appeals and both are dismissed.\nAppeals dismissed.\n1.\n1\n"}
