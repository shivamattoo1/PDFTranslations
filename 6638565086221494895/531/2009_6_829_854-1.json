STATE OF KERALA 839\n[DR. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J.]\n(h) Judicial Confession;\n(i)\nExtra-Judicial Confession\n10. Stand of the accused-appellant is essentially as\nfollows:\n(a) Line of investigation not pursued deliberately\nby the police and leads missed by the police\nwhich would have shown innocence of the\nappellant:\nThe records of the case disclosed that at the very outset\nthere are no circumstances which clearly showed that the\naccused was involved in the crime. However, this line of\ninvestigation was not pursued by the investigating agency. For\nsome strange reason they wanted to show that the case had\nbeen solved and the appellant has been made a scapegoat in\nthe process.\n(b) Presence of spermatozoa in the pubic hair and\nvaginal swab of Kochurani:\nIt has come in evidence of PW-53 that human\nspermatozoa was detected in the pubic hair and vaginal swab.\nThese swabs were subjected to DNA test after taking the blood\nsamples of the appellant. Ext. 90 dated 27.12.2002 completely\nabsolved the appellant as being a source of the male DNA.\nThe Inquest report prepared on the body of Kochurani\nstated that her skirt was rolled up and white fluid was found on\nthe private parts. It was a fresh intercourse. When pursuing the\nline of investigation the prosecution attempts to explain it away\nby saying that it could be an old consensual intercourse\nforgetting that if it was an old intercourse, stains would not be\navailable in the pubic hair after so many days.\nThe other line of investigation deliberately not pursued is\nthe presence of blood stained foot prints atleast 10 in number\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n840\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2009] 6 S.C.R.\nA inside the house. It is sought to be argued by the prosecution\nthat the footprints were not clear enough for arriving at any\nconclusion. In fact to get over this aspect they claim that the\naccused was wearing socks and also show as if socks was\nrecovered. It is an absolutely false story of the prosecution in\nB order to cover up their conduct of not pursuing the footprint\ntheory.\nC\nD\nFurther, in this case the weapons used were axe, two\nknives, a chopper and a double knife. No finger print is sought\nto be lifted from any of these weapons and sent for\ncomparison. The prosecution claims that nine finger prints were\nlifted from the house of which they say five were not clear for\ncomparison, two remained untallied and of the remaining two\nare tallied with PW-14 Tintu Joseph, a nephew of Augustine and\nthe other tallied with accused appellant. As to why no finger\nprints were lifted from the weapons and as to whose finger\nprints were present in such large number has not at all been\npursued by the prosecution.\nMost importantly, according to the prosecution the finger\nE prints on the door post which tallied with the accused had blood\nstain. However, according to the expert, from the blood stains\nit was not possible to decipher as to the group of the blood\nstain.\nF\nAnother important circumstance is the so called pledge of\ntwo chains and one anklet of the deceased by PW-74 Suresh\nin the shop of T.V. Gangadharan (PW-25). The police set up a\ncase that the accused had entrusted the jewellery to Suresh on\n9.1.2001 at Bombay and that Suresh came to Kerala on\n16.1.2001 and pledged the jewellery on 31.1.2001 when he had\nG full knowledge that the appellant was suspected for the\ncommission of offence. Police to support it marked Ext.P-22\nthrough PW-25. Ext.P-22 was a pledge register\ncontemporaneously seized on 20.2.2001 from the shop of PW-\n25. However PW-25 confessed that the register was\nH subsequently got written and was recovered two months after.\n;\nM.A. ANTONY @ ANTAPPAN v. STATE OF KERALA 841\n[DR. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J.]\nWhat was recovered on the day of seizure was the pledge bond A\nand the token. Abraham Cherian (PW-59) the Investigating\nOfficer admits that the bonds were recovered but that was not\nproduced in court. By the impugned order, the High Court has\ndisbelieved recovery of ornaments, namely two chains and one\nanklet. However, what is surprising is if the police did not B\nactually recover, did they pursue the line of investigation against\nSuresh (PW-74) and if not, why not? There are several other\nconcoction and embellishment resorted to by the police for\nreasons best known to them.\nC\nD\n(c) Recovery of finger print of the accused from the\nhouse.- M.T. Jose (PW-14), own brother of Augustine states\nthat accused is brother by relation with Augustine who used to\nfrequently visit the house of Augustine and also house of Jose,\nthe witness and that the accused had full freedom in the\n'tharavad' since mother had son-like relation with him. Similarly,\nMT George (PW-15), another brother of deceased Augustine\nalso states that the accused used to regularly visit Augustine's\nhouse. In view of this assuming that the finger prints of the door\nstep tallied with that of accused just as PW-14, Tintu Joseph's\nfinger print also tallied this is no circumstance against the E\nappellant, the appellant admittedly being a frequent visitor.\nThe finger print was tallied by K. Yogendra Sakhya (PW-\n7) and the report was marked as Ext.P-11. The report reveals\nthat the comparison of the finger print was done with the finger F\nprint of the arrest slip. Apart from that this report says that there\nwere 7 other finger prints, five of which were unclear and two\ncould not be tallied. This shows that there were strangers who\nentered the premises for commission of offence. Further, the\nreport does not disclose the age of the finger print of the\naccused. Accused admittedly visited the house several times\nand definitely on 5.1.2001 and 6.1.2001 he had visited the\nhouse. Secondly, the specimen finger print ought to have been\ntaken before the Judicial Magistrate as per identification of\nPrisoners Act and this procedure having not been followed, no\nG\nH\n842 SUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2009] 6 S.C.R.\nA reliance can be placed on this circumstance as held by this\nCourt in Mohd. Aman and Anr. v. State of Rajasthan (1997(10)\nSCC 44).\nB\nC\nD\nE\nÂ·\nThirdly, the blood group of the so called finger prints\nspecimen could not be detected and particularly the group could\nnot be found as is clear from Ex.P-39. No reason is given.\nHence, finger print is not a circumstance and cannot form a\nbasis or link in the chain of circumstances.\n(d) Recovery of hair:\nParameswaran Nair (PW-53) states in the report Ex.D-12\nprepared by him that one black hair was located by him on the\nbody of Jesmon, that he entrusted it to the Investigating Officer,\nthat he did not seal it, that it was a scalp hair and a pulled out\nhair. What is significant is that no information about the unsealed\nhair allegedly recovered on 8.1.2001 nor the recovered item\nwere sent to the Court earlier to the examination of the accused\nby police i.e. it was not sent till atleast 18.2.2001. Nowhere it\nwas mentioned about the actual date of sending of the said\ninformation. This was adversely commented by the High Court\nwhile ordering a CBI investigation. What is important is in the\nreport Ex.P-36 of PW-53 it is seen that when it was forwarded\nby the Judicial First Class Magistrate it had the seal of Judicial\nFirst Class Magistrate but that packet contained two unsealed\npackets which were the hairs (there is a contradiction as to\nwhether one hair was seized or three hairs were seized from\nthe body of Jesmon but keeping that aside for the time being)\nallegedly recovered from the body of Jesmon. What is important\nto note is PW-53 says he did not seal it and what went from\nthe Court was an unsealed packet put inside a sealed packet\nG of the Court. What is important to note is it is not clear as to\nwhether what was sent for examination or what was seized.\nThis coupled with the fact that contemporaneous report was not\nmade to the Judicial First Class Magistrate on 8.1.2001 throws\na serious doubt as to what was sent to the Magistrate was what\nH was really seized or was it something else. It appears that after\nF\n;\nM.A. ANTONY @ ANTAPPAN v. STATE OF KERALA 843\n[DR. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J.]\nB\nC\nthe accused was examined then only a report was made. There A\nagain Anita Kumar (PW-60) states that she cut the hair of the\naccused and sent for chemical examination. A perusal of Ext.P-\n36 shows that this specimen hair was in closed bottle which\nwas kept in a plastic container. There is no evidence of sealing.\nPW-60 says she did not state in Ex.P-48 that she sealed the\npack but she kept the hair in a glass bottle and after sealing it\nhanded it over to the Investigating Officer. Ex.P-36 does not say\nthat the specimen bottle was sealed. It was just a closed bottle\nkept in a plastic container. What is significant to note in Ex.P-\n36 it is mentioned that both the specimen hair and the seized\nhair had roots. PW-60 says that she cut the hair and while\ncutting there would not be roots. The fact that the seized hairs\nwere not sealed, the fact that the specimen hair was not sealed\nand most importantly the fact that the seized hair on 8.1.2001\nand forwarded only after questioning accused i.e. on or after\n18.2.2001 throws a serious suspicion on the prosecution story\nand it cannot for a basis or a link in the circumstance against\nthe appellant. PW-51 who prepared Ex.P-3 inquest of Jesmon\nhas admitted in cross examination that the hairs recovered from\nthe dead body were sealed then and there and taken to the\npolice station. But admittedly those sealed hairs were seen\nunsealed when it reached in the hands of PW-53 as is clear\nfrom the report. If PW-51 sealed it how they are unsealed is a\nquestion which the prosecution has not answered.\n(e)\nD\nE\nRecovery of the so called pant shirt, kerchief F\nand socks:\nThis theory of recovery is completely bogus. According to\nthe prosecution the accused after the incident went in the early\nmorning to his house and without the knowledge of wife\nchanged the clothes, deposited them in a plastic kit and after\ndepositing it in the compound from where they were recovered\ncame back to the house. What is crucial is CBI investigating\nofficer (PW-77) says that only the handkerchief and socks were\nthrown by the accused. Apart from this, the recovery witnessed\nG\nH\nC\nD\n844\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2009] 6 S.C.R.\nA by PW-68 and PW-73 contradict each other in material\nparticular. While PW-68 says that four items were recovered\nand that time accused was sitting in the jeep, that blood was\nseen in the kerchief and no any other items, PW-73 states that\nthe accused entered the gate and that there were blood stains\nB in all the four items. Obviously, police realized that their theory\nthat the accused came home without knowledge of his wife\nwould fall flat came forward with a case that only handkerchief\nand socks were recovered. In view of these serious\ncontradictions between the police theory and the mahazar\nwitnesses no reliance can be placed on the recovery as a\ncircumstance. Further, if pant and shirt were not recovered how\nit was sent for forensic examination to PW-54 whose report\nstates that the pant and shirt contained blood of âO'.group. CBI\ninvestigating officer says only socks and handkerchief were\nrecovered. PW-68 says blood stains only in the handkerchief.\nPW-73 says that all the cloths had blood stains. PW-73 says\naccused took out the items while PW-68 says accused was\nsitting in the jeep. If PW-68 has come after the items were taken\nout then he is not a recovery witness. If actually handkerchief\nand socks were recovered what has been sent to forensic lab\nis something which has not been seized. There is a serious\nattempt by the prosecution to falsely show recovery of blood\nstained clothes to implicate the appellant. PWs 15, 16 and 17\nsaw the accused in the morning. They introduced the theory that\nthe accused changing the clothes without the knowledge of wife\nF PW-19. All these throw serious suspicion on the theory of\nrecovery from a public place 45 days after the incident.\nMoreover, the recovery itself was organized as a big show that\n500 people having gathered there. The police are supposed\nto have made a theater show by showing clothes from the\nG recovery place. All these show that it was a stage managed\nrecovery on which basis no circumstance and conviction can\nbe imposed on the appellant.\nE\nH\nPW-19 who is the wife of the accused states that the\naccused came in the morning on 7.1.2001 wearing a pant and\nM.A. ANTONY @ ANTAPPAN v. STATE OF KERALA 845\n[DR. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J.]\nshirt. She did not speak of any blood stain.\nThe so called motive for the offence is that the accused\nwas in need of money to go to Saudi Arabia and for that\npurpose he killed the six members. As explained earlier, the\nmotive theory stands exploded in view of recovery of large\namount of cash and jewellery from the scene of crime as is\nspoken to by PW-1 Joseph, PW-45 and Investigating Officer\n(PW-59). If the accused had money as motive, he would have\ndecamped with the booty. Subsequently PWs 23 and 24\ndeposed that accused repaid the loan on the morning of\n7.1.2001 in part to Yohannan (PW-23) and promising to send\nbalance and in full to Raman Nair (PW-24). When the accused\nis a conscientious person who repaid the debts is spoken to\nby PW-14 and PW-24. The accused own case is that on the\nevening of 6.1.2001 Augustine gave him Rs.35,000/- so that\nhe could repay Yohannan and Raman Nair and repay Augustine\nby betting his chitty with DW-1 or after going to Gulf. PW-19\nand PW-23 spoke about the accused having told them that the\nmoney was arranged and mentioned \"Chettathis house\" to PW-\n23 and PW-24. It is enough to show that the accused had\nreturned the money before going abroad. PW-23 only wanted\na signed stamp paper and unsigned cheque leaf which also\ngot on the morning of 6.1.2001 and gave it to him. Accused\nhad a running chitty with DW-1 and spoken to by the said\ndefence witness. It is the accused who having got the money\nfrom Augustine from his shop went and paid to PWs 23 and\n24 and from there with PW-23 came back, went by bus to\nTrichur and from there by train to Bombay. In view of this, motive\ntheory falls to the ground and in the case of circumstantial\nevidence the prosecution has come forward with a motive theory\nthere is an onus on them to prove the same beyond reasonable\ndoubt. The prosecution has miserably failed in its endeavor. It\nis also to be noted that the final report of CBI is not in conformity\nwith that of Crime Branch.\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n846\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2009] 6 S.C.R.\n\u003e\u003e\nA\nB\nC\n(f)\nEvidence of PWs 15, 16 17 saw the accused\nnear the house of Augustine on 7.1.2001 in the\nmorning:\nThe evidence of PWs 15, 16 and 17 has been discarded\nby the High Court. PW-17 discloses this fact to the Court on\n8.4.2003 when her statement was recorded for the first time\nas to how the police came to know that she was passing on\nthe road was not explained. Similarly, PWs 15 and 16 having\nnot disclosed to the police when they were examined under\nsection 161 of the Code. In any case the accused himself came\nback to the house on 7.1.2001 in the morning, no blood stain\nwas noticed by any of the witnesses. The accused's house is\n20 meters away from the house of the deceased. In view of this,\nthese witnesses have been made to utter falsehood and even\notherwise there is no other statement which establishes that\nD merely because the accused was seen he is guilty of committing\nthe murder.\nAccording to PW-15 when he met the accused in the road\nleads to railway station he asked the accused where he was\nE going but he has not replied. This version of PW-15 has been\ncontradicted by his statement recorded under Section 161 of\nCode. PW-17 has also stated that on 7.1.2001 at 5.45 a.m.\nshe saw the accused walking through a road lies in front of the\nplace of occurrence and leads to railway station. According to\nher she was on the way to Hospital to see the mother of her\nmother-in-law. This statement is also contradictory to her\nstatement given to crime branch. According to her she was\nnever questioned by the Crime Branch but was questioned by\nCBI twice. This is utter falsehood.\nF\nG\nH\n(g) So called extra judicial confession to PW-60 as\nrecorded in Ex.P-48.\nA perusal of Ex.P-48 shows that the so called extra judicial\nconfession in the wound certificate is in three lines. It purports\nto say the following:\nM\nM.A. ANTONY @ ANTAPPAN v. STATE OF KERALA 847\n[DR. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J.]\n\"On 6th January at about 9 O' clock while beating A\nKochurani with a stool certain injury on finger by\ncontracting with a knife. No objection to take blood and\nscalp hair for examination.\"\nThis is no extra judicial confession. An extra judicial\nconfession has to be inculpatory and must give substantial\ndetails of the manner of commission. The above two lines\ninserted in a document which itself has certain interpolation in\nthe original. In any event, this is not enough to implicate the\naccused. Further the Dy. S.P. was also there at the time of the\nsaid alleged statement and hence the same is not at all\nbelievable.\n(h)\nSo called confession under Section 164 of Code\nB\nC\nE\nThe accused was arrested on 18.2.2001. He was on illegal\nD\ncustody from 9.2.2001 onwards. The matter was first given to\nCrime Branch CID on 5.4.2001 whereafter it was transferred\nto the CBI on 9.4.2001. This confession under Section 164 of\ncode is recorded in October, 2002. A perusal of confession\nshows that PW-65, Metropolitan Magistrate in the State of Tamil\nNadu is supposed to have recorded the same. The reason\ngiven by the Investigating agency is that the accused desired\nto have the confession recorded in a place outside Kerala. No\nrequest in writing is produced nor the accused is taken to the\nconcerned court and to state the fact that he wanted to record\nthe confession outside Kerala was recorded. In fact from\n25.1.2002 the accused was on bail with the condition that he\nwill not leave the jurisdiction of Alua. Without obtaining any\nrelaxation he was taken to Madras and after torture a confession\nwas recorded in the Metropolitan Magistrate Court, Chennai.\nJayanthi (PW-65) the Magistrate admits that she does not know G\nto read and write Malayalam. The translator was produced by\nCBI but his name was not mentioned anywhere and he was also\ncited as a witness who has not been examined by the\nprosecution. It is suggested that accused gave the confession\nin Malayalam which was translated by the translator to Tamil and H\nF\nà¼\nB\nC\n848\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2009] 6 S.C.R.\nA the recording was made in Tamil. The confession document\nEx.P-59 was not prepared after following the mandatory\nprocedures. The accused was not informed that he was not\nbound to give the statement and if he gives it will be used\nagainst him. Even in the oral deposition PW-65 only says that\nshe explained to him that he is not bound to give evidence and\nlater it may go against him. This is not what is contemplated\nunder Section 164(2) of Code. She should have told him that\nhe is not bound to make a confession and that the confession\ncan be used as evidence against him. Further, a Tamil version\nof the confession was translated by PW-76 who says he cannot\nread or write Tamil. So appellant has a case where PW-65\ncannot read or write Malayalam, PW-76 cannot read or write\nTamil but they can understand Malayalam and Tamil. PW-76\nwas helped by a subordinate Muthukumar who is not examined.\nSo the real translators have not been examined, mandatory\nprocedure has not been followed, the accused had not legally\nbeen taken outside jurisdiction. When the so called confession\nso sought to be relied upon, the accused in his statement filed\nunder Section 232(2) of Code flatly denied the same. This\nconfession cannot be used as a substantial evidence against\nE the accused. In any case, in the absence of any corroborative\nmaterial this is no circumstance against the accused. The\naccused has no knowledge of Tamil and he knows only\nMalayalam.\nD\nF\nG\nÐ\n11. The appellant was in dire need of money as\nestablished by the testimony of PW-67. The Accused/appellant\nknew that his visa had come on 23rd December and that a large\namount of money was required before 10th January 2001. He\nhad also tried to arrange for loan as per the statement of I'W-\n19. She mentions the amount which he could arrange by 5th\nJanuary 2001 and a meager amount of 10,000/- was left with\nhim. From the statement of Yohannan (PW-23) and\nRamachandran Nair (PW-24), the factum of payment of money\namounting to Rs 35,000/- on 7/1/2001 is clearly proved. The\naccused/appellant who was in need of money and who did not\n"}
