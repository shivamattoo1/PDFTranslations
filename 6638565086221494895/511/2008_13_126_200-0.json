DISTRICT 127\nCOLLECTOR, RANGA REDDY DISTT. \u0026 ORS.\nIntegrated Project to be implemented through its nodal A\nagency Andhra Pradesh Infrastructure and Investment\nCorporation (APIIC) to make the city a world class\nbusiness destination. The State Government acquired\nland for the purported development of 'Financial District\nand Allied Projects'. It also invoked urgency clause u/s 17 B\nof Land Acquisition Act dispensing with procedure u/s\n5A of the Act.\nAppellants filed writ petitions challenging the\nacquisition on the grounds that the acquisition was not\nfor public purpose, but the same was with malafide C\nintention to transfer the same to a foreign company and\nfew persons with vested interest; that the action has been\ntaken in colourable exercise of power and in violation of\nthe Act as well as several other statutes. High Court\nupheld the acquisition. However, it held the urgency D\nclause as illegal and hence directed to proceed by\nfollowing the procedure u/s 5A. Wirt appeals were also\nfiled which was dismissed by Division Bench of High\nCourt. Hence the present appeals.\nDismissing the appeals, the Court\nHELD: 1.1 The proceedings initiated by the State for\nacquisition of land under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894\nare not illegal, unlawful, unwarranted, mala fide, fraud on\nstatute or taken in colourable exercise of power. On the\nfacts and in the circumstances of the present case, the\nGovernment was right in forming an opinion and reaching\na satisfaction as to 'public purpose' and in initiating\nproceedings u/s 4 and 6 and in invoking Part II of the Act.\n[Paras 166 and 167] [198 C-F]\nE\nF\nU-\nG\n1.2 Section 4 of the Act expressly authorizes the\nappropriate Government to issue preliminary notification\nfor acquisition of land likely to be needed for any public\npurpose or 'for a company'. Likewise, Section 6 declares\nthat when the appropriate Government is satisfied that a H.\n128\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2008] 13 S.C.R.\nA particular land is needed for a public purpose or 'for a\ncompany', a declaration shall be made to that effect. It is\nthus clear that appropriate Government may acquire land\nif such land is needed for any public purpose or 'for a\ncompany'. If it is so, acquisition will be governed by Part\nB II of the Act and the procedure laid down in the said Part\nhas to be followed. Part VII, on the other hand, deals with\nacquisition of land for companies. [Para 106] [176-C-E]\nBabu Barkya Thakur v.

The\ninclusive definition does not restrict its ambit and scope.\nThe expression is incapable of precise and comprehensive\ndefinition. And it is neither desirable nor advisable to attempt\nSOORARAM PRATAP REDDY \u0026 ORS. v. DISTRICT 129\nCOLLECTOR, RANGA REDDY DISTT. \u0026 ORS.\nto define it. It is used in a generic sense of including any A\npurpose wherein even a fraction of the community may be\ninterested or by which it may be benefited. A 'public\npurpose' is thus wider than a 'public necessity'. Purpose\nis more pervasive than urgency. That which one sets\nbefore him to accomplish, an end, intention, aim, object, B\nplan or project, is purpose. A need or necessity, on the\nother hand, is urgent, unavoidable, compulsive. Public\npurpose should be liberally construed, not whittled down\nby logomachy. [Paras 67, 86] [163-H; 164-A-B 169-A-B]\nState of Bombay v.

'Eminent domain' may be defined as the right\nor power of a sovereign State to take private property for\nG\nH\n130\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2008] 13 S.C.R.\nA public use without the owner's consent upon the payment\nof just compensation. It means nothing more or less than\nan inherent political right, founded on a common necessity\nand interest of appropriating the property of individual\nmembers of the community to the great necessities and\nB common good of the whole society. The power of eminent\ndomain is merely a means to an end; viz. larger public\ninterest. The power does not depend for its existence on\na specific grant. It is inherent and exists in every sovereign\nState without any recognition thereof in the Constitution\nor in any statute. It is founded on the law of necessity.\nThe power is inalienable. No Legislature can bind itself or\nits successors not to exercise this power when public\nnecessity demands it. Nor it can be abridged or restricted\nby agreement or contract.

Simply because a Company has been chosen\nfor fulfillment of such public purpose does not mean that\nthe larger public interest has been sacrificed, ignored or\ndisregarded. It will also not make exercise of power bad,\nmala fide or for collateral purpose vitiating the C\nproceedings. [Para 168] [199-B-C]\n1.6 In case of integrated and indivisible project, the\nproject has to be taken as a whole and must be judged\nwhether it is in the larger public interest. It cannot be split\ninto different components and to consider whether each\nand every component will serve public good. A holistic\napproach has to be adopted in such matters. If the project\ntaken as a whole is an attempt in the direction of bringing\nforeign exchange, generating employment opportunities\nand securing economic benefits to the State and the public\nat large, it will serve public purpose. [Para 169] [199-C-E]\nD\nE\n1.7 It is established in this case that the present\nInfrastructure Development Project conceived by the\nState and executed under the auspices of its F\ninstrumentality (APIIC) is one covered by the Act. The\nJoint Venture Mechanism for implementing the policy,\nexecuting the project and achieving lawful public purpose\nfor realizing the goal of larger public good would neither\ndestroy the object nor vitiate the exercise of power of\npublic purpose for development of infrastructure. [Para\n170] [199-E-F]\nG\n2. Normally, a writ Court will not propel into the\nunchartered ocean of Governmental Policy. In the instant\ncase, in deciding whether acquisition is for 'public H\n132\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2008] 13 S.C.R.\nA purpose' or not, prima facie, Government is the best judge.\nThe entire amount of compensation is to be paid by State\nagency (APIIC) which also works as nodal agency for\nexecution of the project. It is primarily for the State to\ndecide whether there exists public purpose or not.\nB Undoubtedly, the decision of the State is not beyond\njudicial scrutiny. In appropriate cases, where such power\nis exercised mala fide or for collateral purposes or the\npurported action is de hors the Act, irrational or otherwise\nunreasonable or the so-called purpose is 'no public\npurpose' at all and fraud on statute is apparent, a writ-\ncourt can undoubtedly interfere. But except in such cases,\nthe declaration of the Government is not subject to judicial\nreview. A writ court, while exercising powers under Articles\n32, 226 or 136 of the Constitution, cannot substitute its\nown judgment for the judgment of the Government as to\nwhat constitutes 'public purpose'.
