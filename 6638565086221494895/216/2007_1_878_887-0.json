His application was dealt with and considered under\nnon-statutory scheme namely 'Appointment of Dependents of Employees\nRetiring Voluntarily on Medical Grounds'. He was retired w.e.f. 1.11.1993.\nE His dependant was also given employment.\nF\nAppellant-Bank framed Union Bank of India (Employees') Pension\nRegulations 1995, whereunder pension option was made available to the\nemployees of the appellant. Bank called for option to be exercised by the\nemployees who had retired between 1.1.1986 and 31.10.1993. Respondent\nNo. 1 submitted an application for pension under the Regulations, but his\nclaim was rejected by the Competent Authority on the ground that he was\nnot eligible as he was an award staff and was retired under different\nscheme. Indian Bank's association also advised the Bank that the concept\nof voluntary retirement for the purpose of receiving pension on voluntary\nG retirement under Regulation 29 was not available to the award staff.\nRespondent filed Writ Petition seeking grant of pension and the same was\nallowed by Division Bench of High Court.

The respondent A\nNo.1 has not denied his status as an award staff when he sought retirement\non medical grounds. Thus, respondent No.1 cannot take the benefit of the\nletter received by him from the Chief Manager of the appellant-bank,\ntreating him as voluntarily retired from the service of the bank w.e.f.\n01.11.1993 under the Pension Regulations as nomenclature of the words\n*voluntarily retired' used in the said letter will not change the status of the\nrespondent No.1 from award staff to any other category of the employee of\nthe appellant-bank. Thus, Regulation 29, upon which reliance is placed by\nrespondent No.1, is not attracted in his case and his claim for pension is\nnot covered thereunder.

This appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated\n02.04.2002 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Bombay in Writ\nPetition No.567 of 2002 whereby and whereunder Venkatesh Gopal Mahishi\nhas been held entitled for pension under the Union Bank of India (Employees')\nPension Regulations, 1995.\n2. The facts, in brief, are that Venkatesh Gopal Mahishi, respondent\nNo.1 herein, joined the services of the Union Bank of India (hereinafter\nreferred to as 'the appellant-bank') as a Peon on 02.05.1960. On 19.02.1991,\nF\nG\nthe respondent No.1 had submitted an application to the authority seeking H\n880\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 1 S.C.R.\nA retirement on medical grounds with further request to give employment to\nhis dependent son on compassionate ground. The request of the respondent\nNo.1 was accepted by the appellant-bank and he was retired as Daftary from\nthe service w.e.f. 01.11.1993 and later on his son has been given employment.\n3. The appellant-bank, in exercise of the powers conferred by clause\nB (f) of sub-section (2) of Section 19 of the Banking Companies (Acquisition\nand Transfer of Undertakings) Act, 1970 (5 of 1970), after consultation with\nthe Reserve Bank of India and with the previous sanction of the Central\nGovernment, framed regulations called Union Bank of India (Employees')\nPension Regulations, 1995 (for short \"Pension Regulations\"), whereunder\nC pension option was made available to the employees of the appellant-bank\nin lieu of the employer's contribution in the Provident Fund on the employees\nsurrendering the same to the bank. The appellant-bank called for option to\nbe exercised by the employees who had retired from service between\n01.01.1986 and 31.10.1993. The respondent No.1 accordingly submitted an\napplication on 28.06.1994 for pension under the Pension Regulations, but his\nD claim was rejected by the competent authority on 12.11.1994 inter alia on\nE\nthe ground that the respondent No.1 was not eligible to the pension scheme\nas he was retired under different scheme prior to the date of enforcement\nof the Pension Regulations.\n4. The respondent No.1, after about seven years from the date of the\nrejection of his claim for the grant of the benefits of the pension scheme to\nhim, filed Civil Writ Petition No.567 of 2002 before the High Court of\nJudicature at Bombay seeking grant of pension. A Division Bench of the\nHigh Court allowed the writ petition primarily relying on an earlier decision\nof learned Single Judge in the case of Madhav K. Kirtikar v. Bank of India,\nF (1997) 2 Bom. C. R. 524. Now, the appellant-bank is before us in this appeal.\nG\nH\n5. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties at length and have\ngone through the judgment of the Division Bench of the High Court and\nother material on record.\n6. Mr. Raju Ramachandran, learned senior Advocate appearing on\nbehalf of the appellant-bank, has broadly made threefold submissions: (i)\nthat Pension Regulations do not apply to the respondent No.1 as he is an\naward staff; (ii) that the respondent No.1 has sought retirement on medical\ngrounds covered by the non-statutory scheme, which is different scheme\nand on his request his son was appointed on compassionate grounds, thus,\n+\n-\nUNION BANK OF INDIA v. VENKATESH GOPAL MAHISHI [PANTA, J.] 881\nthe respondent No.1 is not entitled to take two benefits under different\nschemes; and (3) that even if the respondent No.1 is held eligible for\npension, the Pension Regulations will not be applicable to him as the\nrespondent No.1 was retired on 01.11.1993 and the Pension Regulations are\nmade applicable to those employees only who have voluntarily retired w.e.f.\n01.01.1986 to 31.10.1993 under the statutory scheme/rules of retirement.\n7. Per contra, Mr. Nitin S. Tambwekar, learned counsel appearing on\nbehalf of respondent No.1, contended that the claim of the respondent No.1\nfor the grant of pension is fully covered by the Pension Regulations and the\nstand of the appellant-bank that the Pension Regulations are not applicable\nto the respondent No.1 as he had sought voluntary retirement on medical\ngrounds, is not tenable and justified. According to the learned counsel,\nthe appellant-bank cannot classify its employees into separate and different\ncategories who have retired on medical grounds or sought voluntary\nretirement on any other ground as per the scheme/rules. The learned\ncounsel also submitted that the claim of the respondent No.1 is covered by\nRegulation 29 of the Pension Regulations and the Chief Manager of the\nappellant-bank vide communication dated 20.09.1993, addressed to the\nrespondent No.1, has categorically admitted that the respondent No.1 has\nbeen treated as voluntarily retiree from the services of the Bank w.e.f.\n01.10.1993. The learned counsel lastly contended that this Court, in exercise\nof the jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution of India, should not\nlightly interfere with the well-reasoned judgment and order of the Division\nBench granting beneficial reliefs to the respondent No.1 - retiree of the\nappellant-bank.\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\n8. We have duly considered the respective contentions of the learned\ncounsel for the parties. It is not in dispute that the appellant-bank framed\nthe above-said Pension Regulations for the grant of pension to its employees.\nUnder Chapter III of the Pension Regulations, Bank shall constitute a Fund\nto be called the Union Bank of India (Employees') Pension Fund. The\nProvident Fund Trust shall, immediately after the constitution of the Fund,\ntransfer to the Union Bank of India (Employees') Pension Fund the\naccumulated balance of the contribution of the Bank to the Provident Fund G\nand interest accrued thereon upto the date of such transfer in respect of\nevery employee.\n9. Regulation 2 (k) defines 'date of retirement' to mean the last date of\nthe month in which an employee attains the age of superannuation or the\ndate on which he is retired by the Bank or the date on which the employee H\n882\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 1 S.C.R.\nA voluntarily retires; or the date on which the officer is deemed to have retired.\n10. Under Clause (n) 'Employee' means any person employed in the\nservice of the bank on full time work on permanent basis or on part-time\nwork on permanent basis on scale wages and who opts and is governed by\nthese regulations, but does not include a person employed either on\nB contract basis or daily-wage basis or on consolidated wages.\n11. Clause (x) deals with the definition of ‘retired' to include ‘'deemed\nto have retired' under Clause (1), whereas under Clause (1) 'deemed to have\nretired' means cessation from service of the Bank on appointment by Central\nGovernment as a whole-time Director or Managing Director or Chairman in\nC the Bank or in any other Bank specified in column 2 of the First Schedule\nof the Act or Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings)\nAct, 1970 (5. of 1970).\n12. ‘Retirement' is defined in Clause (y), which reads as under:-\n\"(a) on attaining the age of superannuation specified in Service\nRegulations or Settlements;\nD\n+\n(b) on voluntary retirement in accordance with provisions contained\nin Regulation 29 of these regulations; and\nE\n(c) on premature retirement by the Bank before attaining the age of\nsuperannuation specified in Service Regulations or Settlements.\"\n13. Chapter II of the Pension Regulations deals with 'Application and\nEligibility'. Regulation 3(1)(a) envisages that the Pension Regulations shall\napply to employees who were in the service of the Bank on or after the 1st\nF day of January, 1986 but had retired before the 1st day of November, 1993;\n(b) exercise an option in writing within one hundred and twenty days from\nthe notified date to become member of the Fund; and (c) refund within sixty\ndays after the expiry of the said period of one hundred and twenty days\nspecified in clause (b) the entire amount of the Bank's contribution to the\nProvident Fund including interest accrued thereon together with further\nsimple interest at the rate of six per cent per annum on the said amount from\nthe date of settlement of the Provident Fund account till the date of refund\nof the aforesaid amount to the Bank.\nG\nH\n14. Chapter V deals with 'Classes of Pension'. Under Clause 28, an\nemployee who has retired on his attaining the age of superannuation\ni\nUNION BANK OF INDIA v. VENKATESH GOPAL MAHISHI [PANTA, J.] 883\nspecified in the Service Regulations or Settlements, is entitled to the\nsuperannuation pension.\n15. Clause 29 to the extent it is relevant and relied upon by the\nrespondent No.1 reads as under:-\nA\n\"Pension on Voluntary Retirement:- (1) On or after the 1st day of B\nNovember, 1993, at any time after an employee has completed\ntwenty years of qualifying service he may, by giving notice of not\nless than three months in writing to the appointing authority retire\nfrom service;\nProvided\nProvided further.......\nProvided that this sub-regulation shall not apply to an employee\nwho is deemed to have retired in accordance with clause (1) of\nregulation 2.\"\n16. An employee is entitled to Invalid Pension under Regulation 30,\nPremature Retirement Pension under Regulation 32 and Compulsory\nRetirement Pension under Regulation 33 of the Pension Regulations.\n17. The respondent No.1, admittedly, gave his option for the benefits\nof the Union Bank of India Employees' Pension Scheme 1993 on 28.05.1994.\nHe undertook to refund the bank's contribution to the provident fund,\namounting to Rs.46,464.33, including interest accrued thereon together with\nfurther simple interest at the rate of 6% p.a., paid to the respondent No. 1\non his retirement. The request of the respondent No.1 was rejected by the\ncompetent authority of the appellant-bank on the ground that the respondent\nNo.1 had sought voluntary retirement from the services of the appellant-\nbank as Daftary w.e.f. 01.11.1993 vide his application dated 19.02.1991 on\nmedical grounds under a non-statutory scheme and with further request to\ngive appointment to his son on compassionate grounds. The appellant-\nbank accepted the request of the respondent No. 1 and he was paid all his\nlegal dues including provident fund and gratuity, etc. on his retirement and\nhis son was also taken into services of the bank as Clerk/Typist. The\nappellant-bank, in its counter affidavit filed in the High Court in opposition\nto the writ petition of the respondent No. 1, has categorically stated that the\nclaim of the respondent No.1 for the grant of pension under the Pension\nC\nᎠ\nE\n☑☑\nF\nG\nH\nB\n884\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 1 S.C.R.\nA Regulations is not covered by the Pension Regulations as Pension\nRegulations came into force from the date of its publication in the Official\nGazette, i.e. 29.09.1995, and were made applicable to the employees, who\nwere in the service of the bank on or after the 1st day of January 1986, but\nhad retired before 1st day of November, 1993 as per terms of Regulation 3(1).\nIt has also been stated that one category of employees, who sought\nvoluntary retirement from the services of the bank in terms of a scheme\nformulated by the bank under the provisions of Regulation 19(1) of the\nUnion Bank of India Officers' Service Regulations, 1979 (hereinafter referred\nto as 'the Service Regulations') made a demand to consider the claims of\nthose employees, who had retired under this scheme between the period\nC 01.01.1986 and 01.11.1993 to be treated as pension optees as was done in\nthe case of those who had retired on superannuation, voluntary retirement\nor premature retirement.\n18. We find from the reading of the counter affidavit of the appellant-\nbank that several writ petitions were filed before the Karnataka High Court\nD and Bombay High Court in regard to the benefits of the Pension Regulations.\nE\nF\nG\nThe matters were later on carried to this Court by the Indian Banks'\nAssociation and the concerned Banks in Special Leave Petitions. The\nSpecial Leave Petitions were finally decided by this Court by an order dated\n05.04.2000 in favour of the voluntarily retired officers of the concerned\nBanks. The benefits of pension were granted to those officers of the Bank\nwho had voluntarily retired between 01.01.1986 and 01.11.1993 as per the\njudgment of this Court. It appears that the appellant-bank thereafter\nreceived a number of representations from its employees, both officers as\nwell as the award staff including the respondent No.1, claiming to be treated\nas pension optees and be given the benefits of pension having voluntarily\nretired between 01.01.1986 and 01.11.1993 under the non-statutory scheme.\nj\n19. The appellant-bank wrote a letter dated 09.11.2000 to the Under\nSecretary, Government of India, Ministry of Finance, Banking Division,\nseeking clarification of the claims of those officers who had voluntarily\nretired during the period between 01.01.1986 and 31.10.1993 on medical\ngrounds and sought appointment of dependents on compassionate grounds\nas well, as per the Bank's own scheme. In response to the said\ncommunication, the Director (IR), Government of India, Ministry of Finance,\nDepartment of Economic Affairs, Banking Division, IR Section, vide letter\ndated 17.05.2001 informed the appellant-bank that the officers, who had\nH retired with simultaneous appointment of the dependents on compassionate\nD\n1\nUNION BANK OF INDIA v. VENKATESH GOPAL MAHISHI [PANTA, J.] 885\ngrounds, will constitute a separate class and hence cannot be extended the\nbenefit of exercising option for pension as has been granted to the incumbents\nwho had voluntarily retired under the scheme formulated by the Bank under\nRegulation 19(1) of the Officers' Service Regulations.\n20. The appellant-bank again sought clarification from the Indian\nBanks' Association on the subject in issue. The Indian Banks' Association\nvide its letter No. PD/GSN/UNION/G2/814 dated 01.10.2001 advised the\nappellant-bank as under:-\n\"1. Voluntary retirement as a concept and as a form of retirement\nwas not available to award staff under the Bipartite Settlement prior\nto the introduction of the Pension Scheme. Even after introduction\nof the Pension Scheme, it is only those who have opted for pension\nwho can retire voluntarily, under Regulation 29 of Bank Employees'\nPension Regulations, 1995.\nA\nB\nC\n2. The decision of the Government of India, as conveyed to the\nBank in case of officer, will equally hold good in the case of\nworkmen also.\"\nD\n21. As noticed earlier, the respondent No.1 submitted an application\ndated 19.02.1991 to the Chief Manager of the appellant-bank making request\nfor voluntary retirement on medical grounds and appointment of his son on\ncompassionate grounds. His application was dealt with and considered\nunder non-statutory scheme, known as Scheme for 'Appointment of\nDependents of Employees Retiring Voluntarily on Medical Grounds'.\nE\nF\n22. Having gone through the judgment of the High Court impugned in\nthis appeal, we find that the High Court has allowed the writ petition of the\nrespondent No.1 simply relying upon the decision of the learned Single\nJudge in Madav Kirtikar (supra) in which the learned Single Judge found\nthe officers of the bank who had voluntarily retired between 01.01.1986 and\n31.10.1993 eligible for pension, irrespective of their retirement on attaining\nthe age of superannuation or under the scheme of voluntary retirement.\nThe High Court has not given any finding on the fundamental issue whether\nthe claim of the respondent No.1 who, admittedly, was an award staff at the\ntime of retirement on medical grounds in the year 1993, is covered under the\nPension Regulations 1995 or not. In our view, the decision of the learned\nSingle Judge in Madav Kirtikar (supra), as relied upon by the Division H\nG\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\n886\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 1 S.C.R.\nBench in its impugned order, is not of any help or assistance either on facts\nor on law to the case of the respondent No.1. In that case, the employee\nof the bank was an officer who sought voluntary retirement under the\nprovisions of the Officers' Service Regulation governing the terms and\nconditions of voluntary retirement under the scheme in the normal\ncircumstances and not on medical ground. Secondly, in that case there was\nno question of appointment of dependent of the retiree on compassionate\nground.\n23. In the normal course, we could have remitted the case back to the\nHigh Court for recording decision on the fundamental issue raised by the\nappellant-bank in relation to the entitlement of pension to the respondent\nNo.1, who had retired as an award staff, but looking to the time-gap between\nthe date of retirement of respondent No.1 w.e.f. 01.11.1993 and pendency of\nthe writ petition in the High Court and Civil Appeal in this Court and with\nthe consent of the learned counsel for the parties, we propose to deal with\nand decide this fundamental issue in this appeal.\n24. The appellant-bank in its affidavit filed before the High Court has\ncategorically stated and pleaded that as per the advise of the Director (IR),\nGovernment of India, Ministry of Finance, Department of Economic Affairs,\nBanking Division, IR Section, the benefit of exercising option for pension\ncannot be extended to the employees who had retired on medica! grounds\nwith simultaneous appointment of the dependents on compassionate grounds.\nThe Indian Banks' Association also advised the appellant-bank that the\nconcept of voluntary retirement for the purpose of receiving pension on\nvoluntary retirement under Regulation 29 is not available to the award staff.\nThe respondent No.1 has not denied his status as an award staff when he\nF sought retirement on medical grounds. Thus, the respondent No.1 cannot\ntake the benefit of the letter dated 20.09.1993 received by him from the Chief\nManager of the appellant-bank, treating him as voluntarily retiree from the\nservice of the bank w.e.f. 01.11.1993 under the Pension Regulations as\nnomenclature of the words 'voluntarily retired' used in the said letter will not\nchange the status of the respondent No.1 from award staff to any other\nG category of the employee of the appellant-bank. Thus, Regulation 29, upon\nwhich reliance is placed by the respondent No.1, is not attracted in his case\nand his claim for pension is not covered thereunder.\n25. This Court in its order dated 03.12.2001 titled as Union of India v.\nB. M. Ramachandra Rao \u0026 Ors., observed as under:-\nH\nUNION BANK OF INDIA v. VENKATESH GOPAL MAHISHI [PANTA, J.] 887\n\"Leaving the question of law open, inasmuch as connected appeals\n(C. A. Nos.6959 of 1997 and batch) have been dismissed, we see\nno reason to interfere.\nThe appeals are dismissed. No costs.\"\n26. It becomes clear from the reading of the above extracted order that\nthe question of law, i.e. imposition of the cut-off date for the grant of\nbenefits of pension to the employees of the banks who have voluntarily\nretired between 01.01.1986 and 31.10.1993, was left open.\n27. This Court in Bank of India v. Indu Rajagopalan \u0026 Ors., [2001]\n9 SCC 318 in Civil Appeal No. 6959 of 1997 and batch, which were the\nsubject matter in Civil Appeal Nos. 1177-1411 of 2000 before this Court in\nUnion of India v. B.M. Ramachandra Rao \u0026 Ors., did not consider it\nnecessary to go into the arbitrariness, validity or illegality of fixation of the\ncut-off date for the grant of pension to those employees who had retired\nbetween 01.01.1086 and 31.10.1993. In this case, this Court simply observed\n\"the number of employees who have retired in this manner and financial\nimplications being small, no interference was called for in the teeth of the\nBank (Employees') Pension Regulations, 1995, Regulations 2(y), 29, 2(t),\n2(u), 3 and 5.”\n28. As we have held that the respondent No.1, having retired as award\nstaff, is not entitled to the grant of pension under the Pension Regulations.\n1995, we do not consider it necessary and expedient to go into the other\nabove-mentioned points raised by the learned counsel for the parties.\n29. In the result, for the afore-said reasons, the appeal is allowed to the\nextent indicated above. The impugned judgment dated 02.04.2002 of the\nDivision Bench of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay allowing the Writ\nPetition No.567 of 2002 filed by the respondent No.1 cannot be sustained\nand it is accordingly set aside and the Writ Petition shall stand dismissed.\nK.K.T.\n30. The parties are left to bear their own costs.\nAppeal allowed.\nt\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\n"}
