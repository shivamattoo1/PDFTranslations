Two criminal cases were initiated against C\nthem arising out FIR No. R.C. No. 8(S)/2001 to R.C. No. 12(S) of 2001/CBI,\nLucknow dated 6.7.2001 and R.C. No. 15(S)/2001 to R.C.

M/s Century Consultants Ltd. has since been directed to be\nwound up in a winding up proceeding by the learned Company Judge.\nD\nIn the aforementioned criminal proceedings, the Appellants prayed for\ngrant of bail which was rejected whereagainst these appeals were preferred.\nThe Appellants before us had contended that they would have no objection\nif the assets held and possessed by them are sold for payment to the depositors E\nof M/s Century Consultants and M/s City Cooperative Bank Ltd. It was\ncontended that the amounts of Rs. 17 Crores and Rs. 13 Crores were lying\nwith the Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange respectively.\nIt was further urged that the amounts lying with the Stock Exchanges stand\nadmitted in their written statements filed in Civil Suit No. 312 of 2002.\nThe Bombay Stock Exchange now contends that the aforementioned\ntwo contentions raised on behalf of the Appellants herein were not correct.\nIn this behalf, our attention has been drawn by Mr. Dushyant A. Dave,\nlearned senior counsel appearing on behalf of Bombay Stock Exchange, to\nthe following statements: :\nF\nG\n\"(ii) That in the instant case, the Century Consultant Ltd., during the\nperiod from 15th March 2001 to 23rd March 2001 had failed to make\npayments to the Exchange towards their settlement obligations in\nrespect of the Rolling as well as Weekly settlement on the respective\npay-in dates.

As at the relevant time,\nthe securities and margin deposits furnished by Century Consultants\nLtd., to avail the trading facility, was sufficient to meet their liabilities\nin the aforesaid settlements, the Exchange completed the Pay-out in\nthe aforesaid Settlements by utilizing same as provided in its Rules,\nBye-laws and Regulations. As these aforesaid Pay-out was to be made/\ncompleted on their respective Pay-out dates and as the realization/\nliquidation of the collateral Securities/guarantees would take some\ntime to receive the payment, the Exchange fulfilled the above\nobligations of the Century Consultants Ltd. initially from the funds of\nthe Exchange. Thereafter the collateral securities/guarantees provided\nby the Century Consultants Ltd. were liquidated in accordance with\npink\nARVIND MOHAN JOHARI v. STATE OF U.P.\n30\nB\n1207\nthe Rules, Bye-laws and regulations of the Exchange and recouped A\nthe same. Accordingly, the Exchange fulfill the Pay-in obligations of\nthe Century Consultant Ltd., in the aforesaid Settlements amounting\nto Rs. 21,06,72,837.00 including the value of short delivery of shares\nby the Century Consultants Ltd., in the above Settlements out of the\ncollateral securities/guarantees provided by the Century Consultants\nLtd. As such, there are no assets of the Century Consultant Ltd., lying\nwith the Applicant Exchange by way of bank guarantee, security\nmargin money etc. amounting to Rs. 17 crores as alleged before this\nHon'ble Court. The Exchange respectfully says and submits that on\nthe other hand Century Consultant Ltd., are required to pay to the\nExchange an amount of approximately Rs. 18.14 crores towards their C\nliabilities on account of non-payment of arbitration awards obtained\nby other members/clients, arbitration fees, debit balance with Clearing\nHouse, Transaction Guarantee Fund (TGF) etc. as per Rules, Bye-\nlaws and Regulations of the Exchange. The Exchange has also from\ntime to time apprised SEBI about default of Century Consultants Ltd.\nD\nin making Pay-in obligations in the aforesaid settlements and\ncompletion of settlements as stated herein above.\"\nIt is urged that the Appellants herein were aware of the said proceedings\nas in relation thereto show cause notices had been served upon M/s Century\nConsultants Ltd. Mr. Dave would further contend that in the said suit even\nno written statement was filed by the Bombay Stock Exchange, as alleged by\nthe Appellants.\nE\nMr. J.L. Gupta, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the\nNational Stock Exchange, would submit that although written statement had\nbeen filed by the National Stock Exchange in the aforementioned suit but it F\nhad categorically been contended therein :\n\"The Defendant No. 1 traded on the Defendant No. 3 and had\ncleared all its settlement dues up to Settlement No. W 2001045 (pay\nin date March 13, 2001). It is submitted that the Defendant No. 1 did\nnot pay subsequent settlement and other obligations to Defendant No. G\n3 and National Securities Clearing Corporation of India Ltd. (NSCCL),\na subsidiary company of Defendant No. 3 amounting Rs.\n18,94,80,836.52. Out of the said sum, an amount of Rs.\n10,80,74,719.54 was adjusted against from the security deposits, bank\nguarantee invocation amounts, sale of securities and release of margins\nH\n1208\nA\nB\nC\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2005] 3 S.C.R.\nand other amounts lying to the credit of Defendant No. 1 still leaving\na balance liability of Rs. 8,14,06,116.98 due from Defendant No. 1\nto Defendant No. 3 and NSCCL. Therefore, it is clear from the above\nthat the claim of the Plaintiff in para 8 of the plaint that the Defendant\nNo. 1 paid Rs. 30 crores towards purchase of shares and that Rs. 30\ncrores is lying with the Defendant No. 3 is completely false. Thus,\nthe very basis of the claim of the Plaintiff is false and there is no\ncause of action in favour of the Plaintiff.\"\nIn the counter affidavit filed by the Appellants to the said applications,\nthe said contentions raised in the said applications were denied and disputed,\nMr. Swaraj Kaushal and Mr. D.K. Gupta, learned counsel appearing on behalf\nof the Appellants would contend that the question as to whether the respective\nStock Exchanges were entitled to debit the amounts of Rs. 21 Crores and 17\nCrores respectively towards their purported claim should be directed to be\nscrutinized by us by a Chartered Accountant. According to the learned counsel,\nthe Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange have raised\nD frivolous pleas in support of the applications and in that view of the matter,\nit would be proper to determine the dispute between the parties.\nE\nF\nG\nH\nIt is not in dispute that this Court passed the aforementioned order\ndated 3.11.2004 granting bail to the Appellants herein relying on or on the\nbasis of the representation made by them that all endeavours would be made\nto disburse to the claimants realise as much amount as possible from the\npersonal and other assets of the Appellants by putting them on sale or\notherwise. It was with that end in view, this Court directed :\n\"The National Stock Exchange and the Bombay Stock Exchange\nare directed to deposit the money lying in the credit of the Company/\nAppellants as early as possible subject to the determination of the\npending enquiry by SEBI. If any enquiry is pending, SEBI shall\ndispose of the same as expeditiously as possible.\"\nThis Court directed release of the Appellants herein on bail on the\nconditions mentioned therein and issued several directives in exercise of its\njurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution of India to do complete\njustice to all the parties. While considering application for grant of bail in a\ncriminal case, this Court ordinarily cannot determine a dispute between the\nparties wherefor forums have been created under the statutes.\nIt appears that the recoveries have been directed to be made by the\n-\n}\nARVIND MOHAN JOHARI v. STATE OF U.P.\n1209\nStock Exchanges in exercise of their power conferred upon them under the A\nbye-laws governing the parties. Furthermore, several arbitration awards are\nsaid to have been passed in favour of the clients/investors and the members\nof the Stock Exchanges. The parties, therefore, must get their disputes\ndetermined in an appropriate forum.\nThe fact, however, remains that no amount as such is admittedly payable B\nby the applicants Stock Exchanges. In their respective applications, as indicated\nhereinbefore, the Applicants had stated that they, in fact, would be entitled\nto realize a huge amount from the Appellants. In that view of the matter, we\nare of the opinion that the Appellants misled this Court in passing the said\norder dated 3.11.2004 by raising contention to the effect that a sum of Rs. C\n17 Crores and 13 Crores are admittedly lying with the Bombay Stock Exchange\nand National Stock Exchange in the shape of bank guarantee money and\nsecurities margin money etc.\nE\nIt is true that the prayers made by the Applicants herein in their\napplications are confined to the directions issued against them but we are of D\nthe opinion, having regard to the peculiar facts and circumstances of this\ncase, that if a substantial sum lying with them are not available for disbursement\nto the claimants, the very purpose for enlarging the Appellants herein on bail\nwould not be subserved and in that view of the matter the order dated 3.4.2004\ngranting bail to the Appellants herein should be recalled. Accordingly, the\nAppellants, Arvind Mohan Johari and Anand Krishna Johari are hereby\ndirected to surrender before the Trial Court within one week from date\nwhereupon they may be taken into custody. If and when the disputes between\nthe Stock Exchanges and the Appellants are adjudicated upon by a competent\nforum and/or court of law, as a result whereof the Appellants would be in a\nposition to repay the outstanding dues of the claimants, namely, M/s City F\nCooperative Bank Ltd. and M/s Century Consultants Ltd., they may apply for\ngrant of bail afresh.\nThese applications are disposed of with the aforementioned observations\nand directions.\nR.P.\nG\nApplications disposed of.\n"}
