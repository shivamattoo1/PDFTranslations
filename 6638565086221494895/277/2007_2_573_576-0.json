Desai, Bhaskar P. Gupta, S. Sukumaran and K. Rajeev for the\nD Appellant.\nE\nR.F. Nariman, C. Mukund, Neeraj, Pankaj Jain, Ashok Kumar Jain and\nBijoy Kumar Jain for the Respondents.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nALTAMAS KABIR, J. 1. Certain shares of the appellant-company were\nbeing held by Poddar Udyog Limited. Under a scheme of arrangement\nsanctioned by the Calcutta High Court on 19th August, 1997, a part of the\nbusiness division of Poddar Udyog Limited was transferred to the respondent\nNo.1 herein. On 3rd September, 1999, the respondent No.1, Poddar Projects\nF Limited, sold the shares to the respondent No.2, Vijaya Finance Corporation\nLimited. The said respondent lodged the shares with the appellant-company\nherein for registration on 12th November, 2001. The appellant-company refused\nto register the said shares on 9th January, 2002 and intimated the advocate\nfor the respondent No.2 of its said decision.\nG\n2. On 16th May, 2002, the shares were again lodged for registration on\nbehalf of the respondent No.1-Poddar Projects Limited, but once again the\nappellant-company refused to register the same.\n3. Such refusal led to the filing of an application by the respondents\nherein under Section 111 A of the Companies Act, 1956 on 28th October, 2002.\nH\n7\n+\n1\nPEERLESS GENERAL FINANCE \u0026 INVESTMENT CO. LTD. 1. PODDAR PROJECTS LTD. [ALTMAS KABIR, J.] 575\nB\nThe Company Law Board allowed the application filed by the respondent A\nNo.1 herein by directing the appellant-company to register the original shares\nin favour of the respondent No.1, but declined to grant any relief to the\nrespondent No.2. The respondent No.2 accepted the order and did not prefer\nany appeal. The appellant-company being dissatisfied with the decision of the\nCompany Law Board filed an appeal before the Calcutta High Court under\nSection 10F of the Companies Act, 1956. Before the Calcutta High Court, it was\nsubmitted on behalf of the appellant-company that since no transfer deed was\ndelivered in terms of Section 108 (1A) of the Companies Act, the lodgment\nfor registration was itself defective and could not, therefore, be acted upon.\nIt was further submitted that till such time as the shares were not registered\nin favour of the respondent No.1-company, the same could not be registered C\nin the name of the subsequent transferee, namely, the respondent No.2 herein.\nCertain other objections were also taken regarding cancellation of stamps and\nthe fact that the transferee was not a desirable person.\n4. The Calcutta High Court negated the submissions made on behalf of\nthe appellant-company and affirmed those of the Company Law Board. It is D\nagainst the said order of the Calcutta High Court that the instant appeal has\nbeen filed.\nE\n5. Although, in the appeal a question was raised as to whether for\nregistration of transfer of shares effected under a scheme of arrangement or\ncompromise or amalgamation sanctioned by a competent court under Sections\n391 and 394 of the Companies Act, it is necessary to execute a further\ninstrument of transfer as contemplated by Section 108 of the said Act, at the\ntime of the hearing of the appeal, it was submitted on behalf of the appellant-\ncompany that the said question had been rendered academic. It was submitted\nthat during the pendency of the appeal, the appellant-company had complied F\nwith the direction of the Calcutta High Court and had registered the original\nshares in the name of the respondent No.1-compnay. Since the respondent\nNo.2 had not preferred any appeal against the order of the Company Law\nBoard, the same became final as far as the respondent No.2 is concerned.\nAlthough, on behalf of respondent No.2, it was submitted that the decision\nof the Company Law Board, as applicable to the respondent No.1, would also\noperate in its favour, such a submission is not acceptable since the respondent\nNo.2 stands on a different footing. Till such time as the shares were not\nregistered in the name of the respondent No.1, the application of the respondent\nNo.2 for subsequent registration of the same shares in its name could not be\nconsidered. Accordingly, the direction given by the Company Law Board in\nG\nH\n576\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 2 S.C.R.\nA respect of the respondent No.1 could not apply to the respondent No.2 and\nthat is why the said respondent No.2 did not prefer any separate appeal\nagainst the order of the Company Law Board.\n6. As pointed out by Mr. Ashok Desai, learned senior counsel, appearing\non behalf of the appellant-company, the questions raised in the appeal have\nB been rendered academic having regard to the fact that the appellant-company\nhas since registered the shares in question in the name of the respondent\nNo.1-company.\nC\n7. The appeal is, therefore, disposed of as having become infructuous\nand the questions raised therein are left open for decision in an appropriate\ncase.\nN.J.\n8. There will be no order as to costs.\n1\nAppeal disposed of.\nj\n"}
