Since a Division Bench of this Court in\nModern Industries' case* has already approved the\ndictum of the Full Bench of the High Court with regard\nto the maintainability of a suit only for interest, that\nquestion is no longer res integra. Therefore, the suppliers\nmay file a suit only for a higher rate of interest on delayed\npayments made by the buyer from the commencement\nof the Act. [para 12] [923-H; 924-A]\n*Modern Industries v. Steel Authority of India Limited\n2010 (4) SCR 560 = (2010) 5 SCC 44 - relied on\n2.1 The fundamental rule of construction is the same\nfor all statutes whether fiscal or otherwise. The under-\nlying principle is that the meaning and intention of a\nPURBANCHAL CABLES \u0026 CONDUCTORS PVT. LTD. v. 907\nASSAM STATE ELECTRICITY BOARD\nstatute must be collected from the plain and A\nunambiguous expression used therein rather from any\nnotion. To arrive at the real meaning, it is always\nnecessary to get an exact conception, scope and object\nof the whole Act. [para 22] [929-B-C]\nZile Singh v. State of Haryana 2004 (5) Suppl. SCR 272\n= (2004) 8 SCC 1 - relied on\nB\n2.2 The remedy sought to be applied by the Act is\nmade clear in the Statement of Objects and Reasons, in\nwhich, it is stated that due to the delayed payments by C\nbuyers to the small scale industries, their working capital\nwas being affected, causing great harm to the small scale\nindustries in general. The Act was passed by Parliament\nto impose a heavy interest on the buyers who delayed\nthe payments of the small scale industries, in order to D\ndeter the buyers from delaying the payments after\naccepting the supplies made by the suppliers. Keeping\nin view the said object, the Act was enacted by\nParliament. Before such enactment, the supplier whose\npayment was delayed by the buyer prior to the E\ncommencement of the Act, could file a suit for payment\nof the principal amount along with the interest. The\nsupplier, thus, had the vested right to claim the principal\namount along with interest thereon in case of a delay in\npayment by the buyer and it was the discretion of the\ncourt to award such interest. The court has the discretion\nto award interest along with the principal amount and the\nsame is clear from the use of the word 'may' in all the\nthree provisions, namely s.34 of the CPC, s. 61 of the Sale\nof Goods Act, 1930 and s. 3 of the Interest Act, 1978. [para\n24-26] [929-F-H; 930-C-D, F-G]\nF\nG\n2.3 With the commencement of the Act, a new vested\nright exists with the supplier, that being, if there is delay\nin payment after the acceptance of the goods by the\nbuyer, the supplier can file a suit for claiming interest at H\n1\nA\n908 SUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2012] 6 S.C.R.\na higher rate, as prescribed by the Act. This position has\nbeen approved by this Court in the case of Modern\nIndustries. Thus, if there is a delayed payment by the\nbuyer, then a right to claim a higher rate of interest as\nprescribed by the Act accrues to the supplier. A statute\nB creating vested rights is a substantive statute. There is\nno doubt about the fact that the Act is a substantive law\nas vested right of entitlement to a higher rate of interest\nin case of delayed payment accrues in favour of the\nsupplier and a corresponding liability is imposed on the\nC buyer. This Court, time and again, has observed that any\nsubstantive law shall operate prospectively unless\nretrospective operation is clearly made out in the\nlanguage of the statute. Only a procedural or declaratory\nlaw operates retrospectively as there is no vested right\nin procedure. [para 27, 29 and 39] [931-A-D; 932-B; 938-\nH; 939-A-B]\nD\nBibi Sayeeda Vs.

The Act, though\nenacted on 2nd April 1993, by a legal fiction is deemed to B\nhave come into effect from the date of promulgation of the\nOrdinance, i.e. 23rd September 1992. Since the Act\nenvisages that the supplier has an accrued right to claim\na higher rate of interest in terms of the Act, the same can\nonly be said to accrue for sale agreements after the date c\nof commencement of the Act, i.e. 23.9.1992 and not any\ntime prior. [para 8 and 40] [918-D-E; 939-B-D]\n2.5 On a careful perusal of the judgment of this Court\nin Assam Small Scale Industries,** even the question\nregarding the applicability of the Act to contracts\nconcluded prior to coming into force of the Act is no\nlonger res integra.

In that case, the H\n910 SUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2012] 6 S.C.R.\nA question of retrospective operation of the Act or whether\npast contracts were governed by the Act, was argued.\nFurther, in the case of Shakti Tubes Ltd., this issue was\ncanvassed due to which, this Court referred to the\nprecedent in the case of Assam Small Scale Industries.\nB This Court, in Shakti Tubes Ltd. expressly rejected the\nargument that the Act should be given retrospective\neffect because it was a beneficial legislation. In the case\nof Rampur Fertilizers Limited, this Court again examined\nthe entire scheme of the Act before following the dicta of\nthis Court in the case of Assam Small Scale Industries.\nEven in Modern Industries, this Court did not differ from\nthe dicta of this Court in Assam Small Scale Industries\nand Shakti Tubes.

LTD. v. 911\nASSAM STATE ELECTRICITY BOARD\nwas rejected by a Division Bench of this Court in Shakti A\nTubes. It cannot be said that the provisions of the Act\nwere not considered in its entirety. In fact, the entire\nscheme of the Act has been considered in the case of\nRampur Fertilizers and specific issue under consideration\nwas answered. In light of the dictum of this Court in B\nAmbika Prasad Mishra and the factum that no case has\nbeen made out for reconsideration, there is no reason\nmuch less good reason to doubt the correctness of the\ndecision in Assam Small Scale Industries or Shakti Tubes,\nand it would be against the spirit of the doctrine of stare C\ndecisis to take any view in divergence with same.

As regards the plea that the extension of date of\nsupply order, from time to time by the Board, amounts to\na novation of contract or supply order in terms of s. 62\nof the Indian Contract Act and, therefore, the new\ncontract or supply order would be governed by the Act,\nsuffice it to say that the ground or issue of novation of\ncontract is a mixed question of fact and law and it is being\nraised, for the first time, at the time of hearing of the case\nwhich cannot be permitted to be raised. The said fact of\nnovation or alteration of contract is required to be urged\nevidentially and scrutinised by the courts below. In\nabsence of such factual findings, it is not possible to\ndecide such a mixed question of law and facts. In Shakti\nTubes Ltd., the issue of novation of contract was raised\nbefore this Court for the first time at the time of hearing.\nThis Court declined to entertain such ground as being a\nmixed question of law and fact.
