At that time, accused nos.1 to 3 were\nsitting in the tractor shed. The mother of the deceased was in the kitchen.\nAccused no.4 decided to finish off the deceased since he had threatened him.\nSuddenly accused no.1 chased the deceased and caught hold of him and\naccused no.4 instructed accused no. 3 to bring a rope. There was a streetlight\nburning at that time.Accused nos. 1 to 3 tied the deceased with the rope. On\nseeing that, PW.1 shouted and the deceased also asked to leave him.

They were also warned by the accused not to\ninterfere, since it was their family affairs. Thereafterm they also left th place.\nEven after the attack, since the deceased did not breathe his last, accused\nno.3 brought a rope and accused nos. land 2 tied it on the neck of the\nE deceased and strangled him. Further, accused no.3 brought pesticide at the\nD\nF\ninstance of accused no.4. Accused no. 1 held the head of the deceased and\naccused no.2 poured the pesticide into the mouth of the deceased.

On receipt of the information,\nthe villegers came to the scene of occurence. The accused threatened PW.\n1 that she will also meet the same fate as the deceased if she told the truth.\nHence before the village Administrative Officer, PW.1 stated everything by\nthe accused, which was reduced into writing and the same was marked as\nEx.P.1.

Against that judgment an appeal was filed before the High Court\nwhich was dismissed. however, it was observed in the judgment that since\nacscused no.4 had died his appeal had abated.\n6. Having heard learned counsel for the appellants we see no reason to\nA\nB\nC\nᎠ\ninterfere with the impugned judgment of the High Court. We see no reason E\nto disbelieve PW.1 and PW.4. PW.1 was the wife of the deceased and her\nevidence inspires confidence. She was stated that accused no.4 instructed\naccused no.3 to bring a rope and then accused nos. 1, 2 and 3 tied the\ndeceased with the rope and brought him to a tractor shed and accused no.1\ntook a wooden reeper and beat the deceased on his forehead. When the\ndeceased cried PW.4 came there and questioned the accused as to why they F\nwere beating the deceased but he was told not to meddle in the family affairs\nand hence he left. Thereafter, accused no. I again attacked the deceased with\na wooden reeper. Accused no. 3 brought a rope and accused nos. 1 and 2\ntied it on the neck of the deceased and strangled him. Further accusedv no.3\nbrought pesticide at the instance of Accused no.4 Accused no.1 held the\nhead of the deceased and accused no.2 poured the pesticide into the mouth\nof the deceased. We see no reason to disbelieve the evidence of PW.1.\nG\n7. Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that PW.1 had earlier\ngiven a different version to the Village Administrative Officer stating that her\nhusband had fallen down from a bicycle. However, PW.1 has stated in her H\nT\n186\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 3 S.C.R.\nA evidence that the statement before the village Administrative Officer was\nmade at that time because she was terrified at that time and was told by the\naccused that they would kill her if she told the truth. At that time she had\nno support from anyone, and it was only after arrival of her father that she\ngot the courage to speak the truth. Hence we are of the opinion that her\nstatement made to the Village Administrative Officer was under duress and\nthreat, and her evidence given before the Trial Court is crediable and is\nsupported by the medical evidence as well as the evidence of PW.4 and other\nwitnesses.\nB\nC\n8. The accused have committed a heinous crime and we see no reason\nto interfere with the judgment of the High Court. The appeal is accordingly\ndismissed.\nK.K.T.\nAppeal dismissed.\n1 +\nA-\n"}
