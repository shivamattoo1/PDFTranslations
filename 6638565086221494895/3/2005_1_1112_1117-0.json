Trial Court held that only some\nof the accused persons were responsible for the act. Assault by one accused\nwas an individual act and he was guilty of offence punishable u/s. 304 Part\nII IPC; that the other two accused were liable to be convicted for offences\npunishable u/ss. 452 and 323 r/w Section 34 IPC; and that since the total\nnumber of persons proved to have committed the offences was only three,\nprovisions of Section 149 were not attracted. Rest of the accused were\nacquitted. Application of the State in terms of Section 378 Cr.P.C. was\ndismissed by High Court without giving any reasons thereto. Hence the\npresent appeal by the State inter alia questioning the manner of disposal\nof the application by the High Court.\nF\nG\nH\nPartly allowing the appeal, the Court\nHELD: 1. The trial Court was required to carefully appraise the\nentire evidence and then come to a conclusion. If the trial Court was at\nlapse in this regard the High Court was obliged to undertake such an\n1112\nSTATE OF HARYANA v. RAM PAL\n1113\nexercise by entertaining the appeal. The trial Court on the facts of this A\ncase did not perform its duties, as was enjoined on it by law. High Court\nought to have in such circumstances granted leave and thereafter as a first\ncourt of appeal, re-appreciated the entire evidence on the record\nindependently and returned its findings objectively as regards guilt or\notherwise of the accused. It has failed to do so. The questions involved\nwere not trivial. The question regarding application of Sections 302 and\n149 IPC as raised does require consideration, keeping in view the evidence\nadduced and conclusions of trial Court. [1115-H; 1116-A-B]\nB\n2.1. Reasons introduce clarity in an order. On plainest consideration\nof justice, the High Court ought to have set forth its reasons, howsoever C\nbrief, in its order, indicative of an application of its mind; all the more when\nits order is amenable to further avenue of challenge. The absence of reasons\nhas rendered the High Court order not sustainable. [1116-C-D]\nE\n2.2. Reason is the heartbeat of every conclusion, and without the\nsame it becomes lifeless. Reasons are live links between the mind of the D\ndecision-taker to the controversy in question and the decision or conclusion\narrived at. Reasons substitute subjectivity by objectivity. The emphasis\non recording reasons is that if the decision reveals the \"inscrutable face\nof the sphinx\", it can, by its silence, render it virtually impossible for the\nCourts to perform their appellate function or exercise the power of judicial\nreview in adjudging the validity of the decision. Right to reason is an\nindispensable part of a sound judicial system; reasons at least sufficient\nto indicate an application of mind to the matter before Court. Another\nrationale is that the affected party can know why the decision has gone\nagainst him. One of the salutary requirements of natural justice is spelling\nout reasons for the order made; in other words, a speaking out. The F\n\"inscrutable face of a sphinx\" is ordinarily incongruous with a judicial\nor quasi-judicial performance. [1116-F-H; 1117-A-C]\nState of U.P. v.

Dhanda, Mrs. Raj Rani Dhanda and Vineet Dhanda\nfor the Respondents.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nARIJIT PASAYAT, J. Leave granted.\nThe State of Haryana questions legality of the order passed by the\nDivision Bench of the Punjab and Haryana High Court dismissing its\napplication under Section 378(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 (in\nF short the 'Code').\nG\nRespondents faced trial for alleged commission of the offences\npunishable under Sections 148, 302, 452, 506, 323 read with Section 149 of\nthe Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short the ‘IPC'). The accusations against the\naccused persons were that they formed an unlawful assembly and being\nmembers of such unlawful assembly, they trespassed into the house of one\nDalel Singh (hereinafter referred to as the 'deceased') and inflicted injuries\non him and his son Nafe Singh (PW-5) by deadly weapons which they were\ncarrying. The date and time of occurrence was stated to be 23.2.1999 at about\n6.00 a.m. There were two eyewitnesses to the occurrence namely Parma\nH Nand (PW-4), the informant and Nafe Singh, the injured (PW-5). Accused\n4\nSTATE OF HARYANA v. RAM PAL [PASAYAT, J.]\n1115\ni\npersons took the plea of false implication and attributed assaults on the accused A\npersons by the deceased and Nefa Singh (PW-5). Three witnesses were\nexamined to further the defence version of false implication.\nThe trial Court found the evidence of witnesses to be credible and\ncogent and found that some of the accused persons were responsible for the\ninjuries on the deceased and the injured PW-5. It held that some of the B\naccused persons did not inflict any injury and the assault made by accused\nRam Chander was an individual act and the other two accused persons,\nnamely, Ram Pal and Palla Ram were to be convicted for offence punishable\nunder Sections 452 and 323 read with Section 34 IPC. It was held that since\nthe total number of persons proved to have committed the offences was only C\nthree, provisions of Section 149 were not attracted. Ultimately, accused Ram\nChander was found guilty of offence punishable under Section 304 Part II\nIPC and other two accused persons named above for the offences punishable\nunder Sections 452 and 323 read with Section 34 IPC. Other accused persons\nwere acquitted of the charges.\nThe State of Haryana filed an application in terms of Section 378(3) of\nthe Code taking the stand that for attracting Section 149 IPC it is not necessary\nto attribute any particular overt act. Further, merely because the accused Ram\nChander had assaulted by the blunt side of the Gandasa, it cannot mean that\nhe did not have the requisite intention to commit the offence of murder. The\ntrial Court having noticed that the blow was given with such great force that\nit caused multiple fractures and laceration of the brain, the alteration of the\nconviction from Section 302 IPC to Section 304 Part II was not correct.\nThe High Court dismissed the application with the following order:\n\"We find no good ground to interfere with the reasoned judgment\nof the trial Court. Dismissed.\"\nLearned counsel for the appellant-State submitted that the manner of\ndisposal of the application as done by the High Court is unsustainable.\nᎠ\nE\nF\nIn response, learned counsel for the accused persons submitted that the G\nHigh Court was justified in not interfering with the elaborate judgment of the\ntrial Court, by refusing grant of leave.\nThe trial Court was required to carefully appraise the entire evidence\nand then come to a conclusion. If the trial Court was at lapse in this regard\nH\nB\n1116\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2005] 1 S.C.R.\nA the High Court was obliged to undertake such an exercise by entertaining the\nappeal. The trial Court on the facts of this case did not perform its duties, as\nwas enjoined on it by law. The High Court ought to have in such circumstances\ngranted leave and thereafter as a first court of appeal, re-appreciated the\nentire evidence on the record independently and returned its findings\nobjectively as regards guilt or otherwise of the accused. It has failed to do so.\nThe questions involved were not trivial. The question regarding application\nof Sections 302 and 149 IPC as raised does require consideration, keeping in\nview the evidence adduced and conclusions of trial Court. The High Court\nhas not given any reasons for refusing to grant leave to file appeal against\nacquittal, and seems to have been completely oblivious to the fact that by\nC such refusal, a close scrutiny of the order of acquittal, by the appellate forum,\nhas been lost once and for all. The manner in which appeal against acquittal\nhas been dealt with by the High Court leaves much to be desired. Reasons\nintroduce clarity in an order. On plainest consideration of justice, the High\nCourt ought to have set forth its reasons, howsoever brief, in its order,\nindicative of an application of its mind; all the more when its order is amenable\nto further avenue of challenge. The absence of reasons has rendered the High\nCourt order not sustainable. Similar view has been expressed in State of U.P.\nv. Battan and Ors., [2001] 10 SCC 607. About two decades back in State of\nMaharashtra v. Vithal Rao Pritirao Chawan, AIR (1982) SC 1215 the\ndesirability of a speaking order while dealing with an application for grant\nE of leave was highlighted. The requirement of indicating reasons in such cases\nhas been judicially recognized as imperative. The view was re-iterated in\nJawahar Lal Singh v. Naresh Singh and Ors., [1987] 2 SCC 222. Judicial\ndiscipline to abide by declaration of law by this Court, cannot be forsaken,\nunder any pretext by any authority or Court, be it even the highest Court in\na State, oblivious to Article 141 of the Constitution of India, 1950 (in short\nthe 'Constitution').\nD\nF\nG\nReason is the heartbeat of every conclusion, and without the same it\nbecomes lifeless. (See Raj Kishore Jha v. State of Bihar and Ors., (2003) 7\nSupreme 152).\nEven in respect of administrative orders Lord Denning M.R. in Breen\nv. Amalgamated Engineering Union, [1971] 1 All E.R. 1148 observed \"The\ngiving of reasons is one of the fundamentals of good administration”. In\nAlexander Machinery (Dudley) Ltd. v. Crabtree, (1974) ICR 120 NIRC it\nwas observed: \"Failure to give reasons amounts to denial of justice\". Reasons\nH are live links between the mind of the decision-taker to the controversy in\nالا\nSTATE OF HARYANA v. RAM PAL [PASAYAT, J.]\n1117\nquestion and the decision or conclusion arrived at\". Reasons substitute A\nsubjectivity by objectivity. The emphasis on recording reasons is that if the\ndecision reveals the \"inscrutable face of the sphinx\", it can, by its silence,\nrender it virtually impossible for the Courts to perform their appellate function\nor exercise the power of judicial review in adjudging the validity of the\ndecision. Right to reason is an indispensable part of a sound judicial system;\nreasons at least sufficient to indicate an application of mind to the matter\nbefore Court. Another rationale is that the affected party can know why the\ndecision has gone against him. One of the salutary requirements of natural\njustice is spelling out reasons for the order made; in other words, a speaking\nout. The \"inscrutable face of a sphinx\" is ordinarily incongruous with a\njudicial or quasi-judicial performance.\nThe above position was highlighted in State of Punjab v. Bhag Singh,\n[2004] 1 SCC 547.\nB\nC\nIn view of the aforesaid legal position, the impugned judgment of the\nHigh Court is unsustainable and is set aside. We grant leave to the State to D\nfile the appeal. The High Court shall entertain the appeal and after requisite\nnotice to the respondents hear the appeal and dispose of it in accordance with\nlaw, uninfluenced by any observation made in the present appeal. The appeal\nis allowed to the extent indicated.\nK.K.T.\nAppeal partly allowed. E\n"}
