He made a representation, which was rejected by\nthe authority concerned. Against this rejection the first respondent filed an\nO.A. before the Central Administrative Tribunal, which was allowed by the\nTribunal. Against the order of the Tribunal the appellant, Union Public Service\nCommission, filed a writ petition before the High Court. Agreeing on the view\ntaken by the Tribunal, High Court dismissed the writ petition. Hence the\n724\n+\n'\nU.P.S.C. v. S. THIAGARAJAN\n725\npresent appeal.\nA\n;\nAllowing the appeal, the Court\nHELD:1.1. Both the High Court and the Tribunal overlooked the fact\nthat the selection of State Forest Services Officers for promotion to the Indian\nForest Service are governed by the IFS (Appointment by Promotion) B\nRegulations, which are statutory in nature. They did not also take into account\nthe fact that the IFS Promotion Regulations were amended vide notification\ndated 31.12.1997, effective from 1.1.1998 bringing about certain changes.\n[Para - 11] [728-E, F}\n1.2. Appellant conducted the selections strictly in accordance with the C\nstatutory regulations and orders issued by the Government of India, and hence\nthere was neither any infirmity nor arbitrariness involved in the selection,\nnor was the procedure adopted by the Selection Authority dubious and\nquestionable as held by the High Court. [Para -12] [728-G, H]\n2.1. Since the definition of the word 'year' underwent a change after D\nthe amendment of the Regulations, there was a transition period between the\nceasing of the effect of the old Regulations and the coming into effect of the\namended Regulations. Under the pre-amended Regulations, select lists were\nto be prepared on a financial year basis whereas after the amendment, select\nlists were to be prepared on a calendar year basis. In view of this, after\nE\npreparation of the selection list of 1996-97, the next selection list would be\nfor the year 1998. As such, there would not be any select list prepared for\nthe period April, 1997 to December, 1997. In order to safeguard the interest\nof those officers who would thus be adversely affected by the transition period\nfrom April, 1997 to December, 1997 during which no select list would be\nprepared, the Government of India issued special instructions. [Para -16]\n[730-C, D, E]\n2.2. As regards the inclusion of tainted officers in the select list of\n1998, the High Court and Tribunal did not notice that provisional inclusion\nof these officers in the select list was done as per the express provision of the\nPromotion Regulations i.e. Regulation 5(4). [Para - 18] [731-G]\nF\nG\n2.3. If an officer against whom disciplinary proceedings are pending is\nconsidered by the Selection Committee, his name is included in the select\nlist provisionally, if he is otherwise found suitable for inclusion. He cannot\nbe appointed to the IFS till his inclusion is declared as unconditional and final\nby the UPSC. In the instant case two officers were included provisionally in H\n| |\n726\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 2 S.C.R.\nA the select list of 1998 subject to their clearance in the pending disciplinary\ncases as such inclusion was in consonance with the Promotion Regulations.\nFurther, the courts below did not appreciate that under the Promotion\nRegulations, an officer who is included in the zone of consideration has to be\nconsidered by the Selection Committee even if disciplinary proceedings are\npending against him. The name of such an officer is included provisionally in\nthe select list, if he is otherwise found suitable for inclusion. The courts below\ntherefore erred in holding that the names of such officers should not be\nconsidered at all. Thus the findings of the High Court and Tribunal are without\nnoticing the express provisions of the statutory Regulations, in accordance\nwith which the Selection Committee prepared the select list. Hence, there\nC orders are vitiated. [Paras 19 and 20] [732-E, F, G, H; 733-A]\nB\n3.1. The Courts below erred in holding that merely because the\nrespondent no.1 was qualified and there was no case pending against him, his\nname should have been included in the select list. The fact that he was eligible\nand qualified only entitles him to be considered for selection under the\nD Promotion Regulations, but does not give him any preference over others who\nhave earned better grading than him. Respondent no.1 was duly considered\nby the Selection Committee at Sl.No.11 and was addressed as 'Good'. However,\nhe was not included in the select list as officers having better grading were\navailable and also due to the statutory limit on the size of the select list.\n[Para 21] [733-B, C]\nE\nF\nG\n3.2. Orders of the High Court and the Tribunal are also liable to be set\naside on the ground that the necessary parties have not been impleaded. Hence\nthe Original Application before the Tribunal was liable to be dismissed on\nthis ground alone. [Para 22] [733-D]\n11\nPrabodh Verma and Ors, etc., etc. v.

Nageshwar Rao, B. Datta, ASG, Binu Tamta for the Appellant.\nKailash Vasdev, P.N. Ramalingam and V. Balaji for the Respondents.\nX\nH\nU.P.S.C. v. S. THIAGARAJAN [MARKANDEY KATJU, J.]\n727\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nA\nMARKANDEY KATJU, J. 1. Leave granted.\n2. This appeal has been filed against the impugned judgment of the\nMadras High Court dated 23.12.2005 in Writ Petition No.30223 of 2002.\n3. Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record.\nB\n4. The first respondent was recruited as Forest Ranger and was promoted\nas Assistant Conservator of forest on 12.7.1982 and he was further promoted\nas Deputy Conservator of Forest on 20.9.1996. He was eligible for inclusion\nin the select list for promotion to the Indian Forest Service. Since his name C\nwas not included in the select list, he made a representation and that\nrepresentation was rejected. Against this rejection the first respondent filed\nan O.A. before the Central Administrative Tribunal, which allowed the said\napplication.\n5. The contentions of the first respondent before the said Tribunal were: D\n(a) Even though he was fully qualified and eligible for inclusion of his\nname in the select list for the year 1998, his name was not considered\nand included in the said year.\n(b) Though there were six vacancies, only two officers were selected. E\n(c) As far as the selection of one Mr. K.S. Krishnan is concerned, he\nhad already crossed the age limit of 54 years, yet his name was\nincluded in the select list for the year 1998 and no valid reasons have\nbeen assigned by the authority concerned for the same.\n(d) The selection committee selected two officers of the State Cadre\nagainst whom vigilance enquiry were already pending.\n6. The Tribunal, after careful consideration of the contentions of both\nthe sides, allowed the O.A. in favour of the first respondent, and passed the\nfollowing order in favour of the first respondent:\n\"(a) The impugned order dated 24.1.2000 is quashed.\nF\nG\n(b) The official respondents are directed to consider the case of the\napplicant by constituting a review DPC for inclusion in the select list\nand appointment of IFS. This exercise shall be completed within three H\n1\nA\n728\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 2 S.C.R.\nmonths of receipt of a copy of this order by the official respondents.\"\n7. Against the aforesaid order of the Tribunal dated 17.4.2002, the\nappellant Union Public Service Commission filed an appeal before the High\nCourt. It was contended by the appellant before the High Court that there\nwere only four vacancies available for consideration by the Selection Committee\nB and not six. Hence it was contended that the Selection Committee which met\non 16.9.1998 included only four officers in the select list for 1998 as the\navailable vacancies for Tamil Nadu at that time were only four.\n8. As far as inclusion of Shri K.S. Krishnan for the post of IFS officer\nfor the year 1998 was concerned, even though the said officer had completed\nC\n54 years on 3.5.1997, his case was considered by the selection committee as\nper the second proviso to Sub-Regulation (3) of Regulation 5 of the IFS\n(Appointment by Promotion) Regulations, 1966.\n9. With regard to the inclusion of 2 officers in the select list, who were\nfacing Vigilance Enquiry, the names of such officers were included in terms\nD\nof the proviso to Sub-Regulation (4) of Regulation 5 of Indian Forest Service\n(Appointment by Promotion) Regulations, 1966.\nE\n10. The High court, however, agreed with the view taken by the Tribunal\nand dismissed the writ petition. Hence this appeal.\n11. In our opinion both the High Court and the Tribunal overlooked the\nfact that the selection of State Forest Services officers for promotion to the\nIFS are governed by the IFS (Appointment by Promotion) Regulations, 1966,\nwhich are statutory in nature. They did not also take into account the fact\nthat the IFS Promotion Regulations were amended vide notification dated\nF 31.12.1997 effective from 1.1.1998 bringing about certain changes. There was\na transition period between April 1997 to December i.e. between the ceasing\nof the effect of the old Regulations and taking effect of the new Regulations\nfor which specific orders dated 27.2.1998 and 14.9.1998 were issued by the\nGovernment of India to safeguard the interest of those officers who would\notherwise have been adversely affected because of the said transition.\nG\nH\n12. We find that the appellant conducted the selections strictly in\naccordance with the statutory regulations and orders issued by the Government\nof India, and hence there was neither any infirmity nor arbitrariness involved\nin the selection, nor was the procedure adopted by the Selection Authority\ndubious and questionable as held by the High Court.\n☑\n1\nU.P.S.C. v. S. THIAGARAJAN [MARKANDEY KATJU, J.]\n729\n13. As regards the question whether there were six vacancies or four, A\nthe High Court and the Tribunal did not take into account the fact that the\nIFS Promotion Regulations and IFS (Fixation of Cadre Strength) Regulations\nwere amended by the notification dated 31.12.1997 which came into effect\nfrom 1.1.1998. The Government of India vide letter dated 27.2.1998 laid down\nthe follow up action to be taken in view of the amendment dated 31.12.1997,\nthe relevant part of which is as follows:\nB\nC\n\"It has been decided that the increase in promotion posts sanctioned\nunder notification No.11033/15/95-AIS(II)-C, dated the 31st December,\n1997, in respect of the Indian Forest Service Cadres are to be given\neffect in a phased manner. The recruitment to the promotion posts\nwhen made in each cadre during the year may be limited to the\npromotion posts as on 31.12.1997 plus one third of the net increase\nin the promotion posts as on 1.1.1998, ignoring the fractions, if any.\nSimilarly, the recruitment in 1999 will be enhanced by half of the\nbalance increase, ignoring the fractions, if any and the remaining\nincrease will be added to the recruitment in the year 2000. The D\nimmediate charge on the increase in the promotion posts in the\nrespective State Cadres will be the persons who stand included in the\nwaitlisted part of Select Lists prepared in 1997 and in force. The\nwaitlisted officers could accordingly be considered for promotion to\nthe IFS against the vacancies made available from 1.1.1998 in the first\ninstance.\"\n14. The Select List prepared in 1997 was for the year 1996-97 and it was\nin force till the meeting of the Selection Committee held on 16.9.1998. S/Sh.B.\nVenkataraman and M. Samuel Moses were the waitlisted officers in the said .\nE\nSelect List. These two officers were appointed to the IFS by the Government F\nof India vide notification dated 10.9.1998 in pursuance to the aforesaid letter\ndated 27.2.1998. Thus two of the six vacancies indicated by the State\nGovernment in their letter dated 6.7.1998 were utilized before the meeting of\nthe Selection Committee on 16.9.1998.\n15. The Tribunal, while reaching to the conclusion that the proposal to G\nselect six officers had been reduced to four in an arbitrary manner without\nassigning any reason, placed reliance on the State Government's notes for the\nSelection Committee indicating that there were six vacancies to be filled up.\nThe State Government's letter dated 2.9.1998 indicating that two of the said\nsix vacancies are to be filled up in terms of Government of India, Ministry of\n1\nH\n730\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 2 S.C.R.\nA Environment \u0026 Forests letter dated 27.2.1998 and only four vacancies would\nremain vacant thereafter for the year 1998 was not at all taken into account:\nby the Tribunal. This has been confirmed by the Government of India in paras\n5 to 8 of the reply filed by them in the writ petition filed before the High Court.\nAs per the amendment dated 31.12.1997 to the IFS (Appointment by Promotion)\nRegulations, 1966, the size of the select list is equal to the number of vacancies\navailable. In the instant case, the Selection Committee was informed that there\nwere four vacancies in the promotion quota of Tamil Nadu cadre for the select\nlist of 1998. Therefore, the committee took into account four vacancies and\nprepared a select list of four officers.\nB\nC\n16. As regards the inclusion of Sh. K.S. Krishnan in the select list of\n1998, since the definition of the word 'year' underwent a change after the\namendment of the Regulations, there was a transition period between the\nceasing of the effect of the old Regulations and the coming into effect of the\namended Regulations. Under the pre-amended Regulations, select lists were\nto be prepared on a financial year basis whereas after the amendment, select\nD lists were to be prepared on a calendar year basis. In view of this, after\nE\nF\nG\npreparation of the selection list of 1996-97, the next selection list would be\nfor the year 1998. As such, there would not be any select list prepared for\nthe period April, 1997 to December, 1997. In order to safeguard the interest\nof those officers who would thus be adversely affected by the transition\nperiod from April, 1997 to December, 1997 during which no select list would\nbe prepared, the Government of India issued special instructions vide letter\ndated 14.9.1998.\n17. The said letter of the Government of India dated 14.9.1998 was\nissued by way of clarification regarding the applicability of Regulation 5(3)\nof the Promotion Regulations in the context of the amendments dated 31.12.1997\nto the IAS/IPS/IFS Promotion Regulations. The relevant part of the said letter\nis reproduced here:\n\"It is observed that in terms of the amended Regulations, 1st January,\n1998 is the crucial date by which the eligibility criteria for consideration\nof the State Service Officers for consideration by the Selection\nCommittee are required to be satisfied. In terms of Regulation 5(3), as\namended, a State Civil Service Officer who has crossed 54 years\nbetween 1st April, 1997 and 31st December, 1997 and hence above 54\nyears as on the 1st January of the 1998 is not eligible to be considered\nby the 1998 selection committee, though he would have been eligible\nH\nU.P.S.C. v. S. THIAGARAJAN [MARKANDEY KATJU, J.]\n731\nto be considered by the 1997-98 selection committee scheduled to A\nmeet by March, 1998, had the Regulations not been amended.\nThe matter has been carefully considered. It is observed that in terms\nof the second proviso to Regulation 5(3) of the IAS (Appointment by\nPromotion) Regulations, 1955, those officers who had crossed 54\nyears of age on the crucial date and who were not considered in the B\nyear immediately preceding the year in which the meeting of the\nCommittee is held are entitled to be considered by the committee in\naddition to the normal zone of consideration placed before the\ncommittee. The 1997-98 select list in terms of the Promotion Regulations\nexisted as a legal fiction upto the 31st December, 1997 and it ceased\nto exist with the coming into force of the IAS (Appointment by\nPromotion) Second Amendment Regulations, 1997, w.e.f. 1.1.1998. In\nall the cases, where the Selection Committee for 1997-98 did not meet\nduring the period from 1.4.1997 to 31.12.1997, it has to be construed\nthat the Selection Committee for immediately preceding year did not\nmeet and those officers crossing the age of 54 years during this year D\nallowed the benefit of consideration by the 1998 Selection Committee\nas and when it meets in terms of the second proviso to sub-Regulation\n3 of Regulation 5 of the amended Regulations.\"\nC\nShri Krishnan who was confirmed on 19.1.1998 with retrospective effect\nfrom 1.6.1996 was entitled to be considered by the Selection Committee in E\naddition to the normal zone of consideration in terms of the second proviso\nto Regulation 5(3) of the IFS (Appointment by Promotion) Regulations, 1966\nas clarified by the Government of India, Department of Personnel \u0026 Training\nvide their letter dated 14.9.1998. This letter was issued by the Government of\nIndia especially in the context of the amendment dated 31.12.1997 to the IAS/\nIPS/IFS (Appointment by Promotion) Regulations in order to safeguard the\ninterests of those officers who would be adversely affected by the transition\nperiod from April, 1997 to December, 1997 for which period no select list was\nto be prepared.\nF\n18. As regards the inclusion of tainted officers in the select list of 1998, G\nin our opinion the High Court and Tribunal did not notice that provisional\ninclusion of these officers in the select list was done as per the express\nprovision of the Promotion Regulations i.e. Regulation 5(4) which is as follows:\n\"The list shall be prepared by including the required number of names\nfirst from amongst the officers finally classified as 'outstanding' then H\nL\n732\nA\nB\nC\nᎠ\nE\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 2 S.C.R.\nfrom amongst those similarly classified as 'Very Good' and thereafter\nfrom amongst those similarly classified as 'Good' and the order of\nnames inter-se within each category shall be in the order of their\nseniority in the State Forest Service.\nProvided that the name of an officer so included in the list shall be\ntreated as provisional if the State Government withholds the integrity\ncertificate in respect of such an officer or any proceedings, departmental\nor criminal are pending against him or anything adverse against him\nwhich renders him unsuitable for appointment to the service has come\nto the notice of the State Government.\nExplanation I: The proceedings shall be treated as pending only if\na charge-sheet has actually been issued to the officer or filed in a\ncourt as the case may be.\nExplanation II: The adverse thing which came to the notice of the\nState Government rendering his unsuitable for appointment to the\nservice shall be treated as having come to the notice of the State only\nif the details of the same have been communicated to the Central\nGovernment is satisfied that the details furnished by the State\nGovernment have a bearing on the suitability of the officers and\ninvestigation thereof is essential.\"\n19. Thus, if an officer against whom disciplinary proceedings are pending\nis considered by the Selection Committee, his name is included in the select\nlist provisionally, if he is otherwise found suitable for inclusion. He cannot\nbe appointed to the IFS till his inclusion is declared as unconditional and final\nby the UPSC. In the instant case Shri Shenabagamurthy and T. Srinivasan\nF were included provisionally in the select list of 1998 subject to their clearance\nin the pending disciplinary cases as such inclusion was in consonance with\nthe Promotion Regulations. Further, the courts below did not appreciate that\nunder the Promotion Regulations, an officer who is included in the zone of\nconsideration has to be considered by the Selection Committee even if\ndisciplinary proceedings are pending against him. The name of such an officer\nis included provisionally in the select list, if he is otherwise found suitable\nfor inclusion. The courts below therefore erred in hold that the names of such\nofficers should not be considered at all.\nG\nH\n20. Thus the findings of the High Court and Tribunal are without\nnoticing the expression provisions of the statutory Regulations, in accordance\n733\nU.P.S.C. v. S. THIAGARAJAN [MARKANDEY KATJU, J.]\nwith which the Selection Committee prepared the select list. Hence in our A\nopinion there orders are vitiated.\n21. The Selection Committee acted strictly in accordance with the\nprovisions of the Promotion Regulations, which are statutory in nature. The\ncourts below erred in holding that merely because the respondent no.1 was\nqualified and there was no case pending against him, his name should have B\nbeen included in the select list. The fact that he was eligible and qualified only\nentitles him to be considered for selection under the Promotion Regulations,\nbut does not give him any preference over others who have earned better\ngrading than him. Respondent no.1 was duly considered by the Selection\nCommittee at Sl.No.11 and was addressed as 'Good'. However, he was not\nincluded in the select list as officers having better grading were available and\nalso due to the statutory limit on the size of the select list.\nC\n22. Apart from the above we are also of the opinion that orders of the\nHigh Court and the Tribunal are liable to be set aside on the ground that the\nnecessary parties have not been impleaded. Hence the Original Application D\nbefore the Tribunal was liable to be dismissed on this ground alone vide\nPrabodh Verma and Ors., etc., etc. v. State of Uttar Pradesh and Ors. etc.,\nAIR (1985) SC 167.\n23. For the reasons given above, this appeal is allowed and the impugned\norder of the High Court as well as of the Tribunal are set aside.\nS.K.S.\n24. There shall be no order as to costs.\nAppeal allowed.\nE\n"}
