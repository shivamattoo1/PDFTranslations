Hence the present appeal.\nDisposing of the appeal, the Court\nC\nD\nHELD: 1.1. High Court has disposed of the First Appeal practically by E\na non-reasoned order. It did not even consider the plea of the defendants as to\nwhy there was non-appearance. Be that as it may, the course adopted by the\ntrial Court appears to be unusual. Therefore, it is proper to remit the matter\nto the trial Court for fresh adjudication. [Para 8] [1039-B]\n1.2. It is also proper that the appellants should pay cost to the respondent. F\nEven if the reason for non-appearance is accepted to be correct, the plaintiff\nwas certainly prejudiced.

The same has to be meted out by\ncosts which is fixed at Rs.20,000/-. [Para 9] [1039-C]\nCIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 876 of 2007.\nFrom the Judgment and final Order dated 29.9.2004 of the High Court\nof Delhi at New Delhi in F.A.O. No. 681 of 2003.\n1037\nG\nH\nA\n1038\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 2 S.C.R.\nM.L. Verma, K.K. Khurana, Sanjay Pal, Vaibhav Dang and Rajiv Nanda\nfor the Appellants.\nRespondent-In-Person through P.K. Aggarwal\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nB\nDR. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. 1. Leave granted.\n2. Challenge in this appeal is to the order passed by a learned Single\nJudge of the Delhi High Court dismissing the First Appeal No. 681/2003 and\nupholding the order passed by learned Additional District Judge in Suit No.54\nC of 2001.\n3. Detailed reference to the factual aspects would be unnecessary except\nnoting the vital aspects.\n4. Suit No.54/2001 was filed in the Court of District Judge, Delhi. The\nD same was for possession, recovery of damages and mesne profit and rent @\nRs.70,664/- p.m. i.e. On 26.2.2002 the learned Additional District Judge framed\nissues and the case was adjourned to 13.5.2002 for the evidence of the\nplaintiff. On 13.5.2002 the Presiding Officer was on leave and the case was\nadjourned to 29.5.2002 for the plaintiff's evidence. On 29.5.2002 none appeared\nfor the defendant and the matter was adjourned to be taken up on 31.5.2002\nfor final arguments and the matter was directed to be placed for orders after\nlunch. Finally, the suit was decreed. The appeal filed by the defendants was\ndismissed.\nE\nF\nG\nH\n5. Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the course adopted\nby the trial Court has no sanctity in law. The matter was listed on 13.5.2002\nfor plaintiff's evidence and was subsequently adjourned to 29.5.2002. Even\nif the defendants were not present the order could have been at the most to\nset the defendants ex parte and another date should have been fixed.\nInterestingly, the matter was taken up that very day and a long judgment\nrunning into several pages was delivered.\n6. It was submitted that the reason for non-appearance was indicated\nto be wrong noting of the date by learned counsel appearing for the defendants.\nThe High Court did not discuss any of the pleas and the submissions and\nby a cryptic order dismissed the appeal.\n7. Learned counsel for the respondent on the other hand submitted that\nSAHARA INDIA v. M.C. AGARWAL HUF [PASAYAT, J.] 1039\nthe appellants have not come with clean hands, and they have given a wrong A\nand distorted picture.\n8. We find that the High Court has disposed of the First Appeal\npractically by a non-reasoned order. It did not even consider the plea of the\ndefendants as to why there was non-appearance. Be that as it may, the course\nadopted by the trial Court appears to be unusual. Therefore, we deem it B\nproper to remit the matter to the trial Court for fresh adjudication. Since the\nmatter is pending the trial Court shall dispose of the matter within three\nmonths from the date of receipt of our order.\nC\n9. It is also proper that the appellants should pay cost to the respondent.\nEven if the reason for non-appearance is accepted to be correct, the plaintiff\nwas certainly prejudiced. Merely because the learned counsel appearing for\nthe defendants did not take proper care and caution that cannot be a ground\nto loose sight of the prejudice caused to the plaintiff-respondent. The same\nhas to be meted out by costs which we fix at Rs.20,000/-. The amount shall\nbe paid within 10 days from today. A receipt shall be filed before the trial D\nCourt immediately thereafter so that our directions for disposal within three\nmonths can be duly complied with.\n10. Parties are permitted to place copy of our order before the trial Court\nso that necessary directions can be issued.\nN.J.\n11. The appeal is disposed of.\nE\nAppeal disposed of.\n"}
