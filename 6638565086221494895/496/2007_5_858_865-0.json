However, VD expressed his inability and asked RK-his brother to\ncarry the accused since RK was going towards that place for getting the\nservicing of his car. U informed that two more persons would also come along\nwith him. On the way RK along with U picked up more persons and RK\nstopped near his house and informed his mother that he would be late.\nHowever, RK did not return home on the next day and his father asked VD to\nsearch for RK. VD enquired at the Police Station and was informed that the\npolice had taken possession of a car found lying abandoned. VD recognized\nthe car as owned by his brother and the number plate was found missing.\nFather of RK and VD lodged a missing report about RK. After few days on\nthe basis of the information by resident of the village, U was identified by VD\nand one more person as the one who had accompanied RK in his car on the\ndate of hiring taxi.

The judgment of the High Court cannot be sustained. No A\ndoubt, there is no direct evidence in the case and the prosecution case is based\non circumstantial evidence. However, a perusal of the judgment of the High\nCourt shows that High Court has not properly considered the evidence on\nrecord and based its findings an ipse dixit. The statements of the witnesses\nclearly identify U who travelled with the deceased. It seems that the High Court\nhas disregarded the said evidence on flimsy grounds. It appears to be clearly\nestablished that U was the person who travelled with the deceased in his car\non the date the taxi was hired. [Paras 13 and 15] [864-D, G, H; 865-A]\n1.2. The prosecution case is of the last seen evidence and is also based\non recoveries at the instance of the accused. [Para 16] [865-A-B]\n1.3.

It has also come in the\nevidence of other witnesses that the deceased was also seen subsequently in\nthe company of the other accused also. It is also the prosecution case that U\nB\nC\nwhile in police custody made disclosure statements leading to the recovery of D\nthe dead body of R under a culvert, and other disclosures were also said to\nhave been made by the other accused.

These appeals have been filed by the State\nof Himachal Pradesh against the judgment of the Himachal High Court dated\n11.5.2000 in Criminal Appeal Nos.199 of 1998, 25 of 1998, 50 of 1998 and 127\nof 1998 by which the conviction of the accused by the trial court was set\naside.\n2. Heard learned counsel of the parties and perused the record.\n3. The prosecution case is that Ramesh Kumar (deceased) resident of\nvillage Hat, Tehsil Theog, district Shimla, H.P, was owner of Car No.HP-09-\n1617. His brother Vasu Dev (PW-2) also owned a taxi (Maruti Van) No.HP-09-\n1214. Both of them were present at Chhaila on 1.4.1997. At about 4 p.m.\naccused Uttam Kumar approached Vasu Dev to hire his taxi for going to Kalka\nsaying that his brother had met with an accident near Surajpur and was in\na serious condition. Vasu Dev, however, expressed his inability to take his taxi\nto Kalka because his taxi was out of order. Accused Uttam Kumar implored\nhim that keeping in view the situation in which the accused was, some\nD arrangement might be made for taking him to Kalka. Since Ramesh Kumar was\ngoing to Solan for servicing of his car, Vasu Dev asked him to carry the\naccused upto Kalka. Uttam Kumar informed them that he wanted to carry two\nmore persons in the vehicle from Mori Kyar road and two more from Fagu.\nThereupon, Ramesh Kumar, deceased, along with accused Uttam Kumar took\nhis car to Mori Kyar and from there, they started towards Kalka. On the way,\nRamesh Kumar stopped near his house in village Hat and informed his mother\nthat he would be back late in the night or the next morning. Ramesh Kumar,\nhowever, did not return home even on the next day, and hence his father\nSitaram asked PW-2 Vasu Dev to search for Ramesh Kumar. PW-2 telephonically\ncontacted his relatives at Shimla and other places to find out the whereabouts\nof Ramesh Kumar and also went towards Kalka in his taxi. On his way to\nKalka, Vasu Dev on 5.4.1997, made enquiries at Police Station, Dharampur\nwhere he was informed that Spatu Police had taken in its possession a car\nunder Section 102 Cr.P.C. as the same was found lying abandoned. Vasu Dev\nthen went to Spatu and recognized the car owned by his brother Ramesh\nKumar with the help of a sticker as its number place was found missing. In\nthe meanwhile, on the same day, Sita Ram (PW-1), father of Ramesh Kumar\nand Vasu Dev, lodged a report about the missing of Ramesh Kumar since\n1.4.1997 at Police Station, Theog. In the evening on the same day, when Vasu\nDev returned home, he informed his father about taking in possession of the\nabandoned car of Ramesh Kumar by Spatu Police. This made Sita Ram\nH apprehensive of the safety of his son Ramesh Kumar. On 6.4.1997, when a\nF\nG\nSTATE OF HIMACHAL PRADESH v. UTTAM KUMAR (MARKANDEY KATJU, J.] 861\nB\nhead constable had gone to the village of the deceased to make enquiries A\nabout the report lodged by his father, PW-1 Sita Ram informed him that car\nof the deceased had been found at Spatu. Thereupon, the said head constable,\nnamely, Ram Singh (PW-15) recorded the statement of Sita Ram under Section\n154 Cr.P.C. Ex.PB and as a consequence, FIR No.50 of 1997 under Sections\n364/34 IPC was registered at Police Station, Theog. For almost a week, neither\nthe police nor the relatives of Ramesh could secure any information about the\nwhereabouts of Ramesh Kumar. On 12.4.1997, PW-2 Vasu Dev went to the\ntemple of the local Diety in village Guthan to get the blessings of the Diety\nin helping tracing out his brother. When he came out of the temple, a resident\nof the village informed him that a young man and a young woman had been\nstaying in the house of Mast Ram in village Guthan for 20 to 25 days prior C\nto 1.4.1997. Thereafter, Vasu Dev contacted Mast Ram who confirmed the said\ninformation given by the villager and it was also found that son of Mast Ram,\nnamely, accused Suresh Kumar had also left the village with the said young\nman and woman on 1.4.1997 but had not returned to the village. The villagers\nand Mast Ram further informed Vasu Dev that the said young man and\nwoman had come to the village in Taxi No.HPY-1992 which remained parked\noutside the house of Mast Ram even after they had left, but for the last two\nor three days, the taxi was not there. On the request of Vasu Dev, Mast Ram\nagreed to send his own son Mohinder Singh to Vasu Dev the next day so\nthat both of them could search for Ramesh Kumar and Suresh Kumar.\nD\nE\n4. On the next day i.e. 13.4.1997, Mohinder Singh came to Chhaila and\nmet Vasu Dev who was at that time accompanied by Inder Singh. He informed\nVasu Dev that the young man and young girl who had been staying in his\nhouse in village Guthan had given their address to him and that they were\nresidents of Jutogh cantonment. Thereafter, Vasu Dev, Inder Singh and\nMohinder Singh came to Jutogh where Mohinder Singh went to the house F\nwhose address was available with him while Vasu Dev and Inder Singh\nremained at some distance. On the call of Mohinder Singh, accused Uttam\nKumar came out of the house and was identified by Vasu Dev and Inder Singh\nas the person who had left Chhaila on 1.4.1997 in the car of Ramesh Kumar.\nThereafter, Mohinder Singh, Inder Singh Vasu Dev went to the Police Station.\nTheog and narrated the aforesaid facts to the Officer-In-Charge of the said\nPolice Station. On receipt of this information, the Officer-In-Charge, Police\nStation, Theog along with a few other police officials, Vasu Dev, Inder Singh,\nMohinder Singh and a few other persons of the locality came to Jutogh where\nthe house of accused Uttam Kumar was surrounded. At about 6 a.m. accused\nUttam Kumar came out of his house and was identified by Vasu Dev and Inder H\nG\n862\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 5 S.C.R.\nA Singh as the person who had accompanied the deceased in his car on 1.4.1997\nfrom Chhaila. Thereupon, accused Uttam Kumar was taken into custody by\nthe police and was taken to Police Station, Theog. During the course of\ninterrogation, accused Uttam Kumar allegedly made a disclosure statement\nthat he and accused Suresh Kumar and Praveen Sabarwal had hidden the\ndead body of Ramesh Kumar under a culvert near Ghana Hatti and he could\nget the same recovered. Pursuant to the said statement, accused Uttam Kumar\ngot recovered a badly defaced dead body in the presence of Inder Singh and\nShiv Dutt who identified the dead body so recovered to be that of deceased\nRamesh Kumar. A rope was tied around its neck. The doctor who conducted\nthe post mortem of the dead body noticed two ligature marks on the neck and\nC opined that the cause of death of the deceased was asphyxia resulting from\nB\nD\nE\nF\nG\nante mortem strangulation by ligature. Some other external and internal injuries\ni.e. fracture, contusions and abrasions were also notice on the dead body. On\nthe evening of 14.4.1997 accused Suresh Kumar and Parveen Sabarwal were\nalso arrested by the police. On 16.4.1997 while in police custody, accused\nSuresh Kumar allegedly made a disclosure statement in the presence of PWS\nOm Prakash and Sita Ram that he could point out the spots by visiting the\nsame where he along with Uttam Kumar and Parveen Sabarwal had murdered\nthe driver of Maruti Car No.HP-09-1617, removed the number plate of the car,\ntook off the wearing apparels etc. from the body of Ramesh Kumar and where\nthe dead body was thrown and concealed. He further disclosed that he had\nhidden the stone and sythe used for preparation of `kiltas' wherewith the face\nof the deceased was defaced by him and could get the same recovered. He\nfurther disclosed that he and accused Uttam Kumar knew the spots where the\nwearing apparels of the deceased, number plates of his vehicle and documents\netc. had been burnt. Pursuant to this statement, a stone and a drati were\nrecovered and taken in possession by the police at the instance of accused\nSuresh Kumar. Accused Suresh Kumar and Uttam Kumar also led the police\nparty to a spot in a forest near Hira Nagar and pointed out a place where some\nash, partly burnt pieces of wood and plastic articles were lying. Those were\nalso taken in possession by the police.\n5. On the same day i.e. 16.4.1997 it is alleged that accused Parveen\nSabarwal also made a disclosure statement stating that she had kept hidden\nthe wrist watch of the deceased in the house of the brother of her husband\nin Jutogh along with the clothes of the accused persons which they were\nwearing at the time of the commission of the offence and which she could\nget recovered. Pursuant to the said statement, accused Parveen Sabarwal got\nH recovered the wrist watch of the deceased and also some clothes from the\n-\n3\nSTATE OF HIMACHAL PRADESH v. UTTAM KUMAR (MARKANDEY KATJU, J.] 863\nresidential house of accused Rajesh Kumar at Jutogh Cantt which were also A\ntaken in possession by the police.\nB\n6. On 18.4.1997, Rajesh Kumar aforesaid who is brother of accused\nUttam Kumar was also arrested by the police along with his Maruti Van\nNo.HP-02-1111. A few tools were recovered from his said van which were\nidentified as belonging to the deceased. On the same day, accused Rajesh\nKumar made a disclosure statement that he had kept hidden four rims with\ntyres and some tools under a culvert near village Dhanda and some parts of\na Maruti Car had been kept by him under a culvert near Kachi Ghati which\nhe could get recovered. Pursuant to the said statement, accused Rajesh\nKumar got four rims and tyres and some parts of Maruti Car recovered which\nrims and parts were identified by Vasu Dev as those of the car of his deceased\nbrother Ramesh Kumar. On 20.4.1997, accused Uttam Kumar allegedly made\nyet another disclosure statement to the effect that he had kept hidden the\nnumber plate of Car No.HP-09-1617 in the house of his brother Rajesh Kumar.\nPursuant to such statement, he led the police party to the house of his brother\nRajesh Kumar and got the number plate recovered which was taken in D\npossession by the police.\n7. On conclusion of the investigation, the Officer-In-Charge of the\nconcerned police station submitted a charge-sheet against the accused persons\nunder Sections 302, 201, 212, 404, 414 and 120-B IPC.\nC\nE\n8. The learned Sessions Judge framed a charge under Sections 120-B\nread with Sections 302 and 382 IPC, 302 IPC, 382 IPC, 404 IPC and Section\n201 IPC read with Sections 302, 382, 404 and 120-B IPC against accused Uttam\nKumar, Suresh Kumar and Parveen Sabarwal and a charge under Sections 120-\nB read with Sections 382 and 302 IPC, 404 IPC and Section 201 IPC read with F\nSections 302 and 382 IPC and 120-B IPC was framed against accused Rajesh\nKumar. Accused pleaded not guilty to the said charges.\n9. To prove the charges against the accused, the prosecution examined\nas many as 19 witnesses.\nG\n10. Statements of the accused under Section 313 Cr.P.C. were recorded\nwherein accused persons denied the prosecution case. Accused Rajesh Kumar\nfurther claimed that, at the relevant time, many dead bodies were found in\nGhana Hatti area and the police could not apprehend the real culprits and\nfalsely implicated the accused persons. Accused Uttam Kumar and Parveen\nSabarwal further claimed that they were pressurized/tortured to make the H\n864\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 5 S.C.R.\nA disclosure statements. Accused Suresh Kumar claimed that he had gone to\nthe house of his maternal uncle in village Himri where he was informed that\nhis brother was arrested. Then he went to Police Station, Theog to find out\nas to why his brother was arrested and when he reached there, the police\narrested him too. The accused, however, did not lead any evidence in their\ndefence.\nB\n11. The learned Sessions Judge found the accused guilty of the\ncommission of the offences for which they were convicted and sentenced as\naforesaid.\n12. Against the judgment of the trial court four appeals were filed in the\nC\nHigh Court which have been allowed by the impugned judgment dated 11.5.2000\nand all the accused were acquitted. These appeals have been filed against the\nsaid judgment of the High Court.\nD\nE\nF\n13. We have carefully gone through the judgment of the High Court and\nwe are of the opinion that it cannot be sustained. No doubt, there is no direct\nevidence in the case and the prosecution case is based on circumstantial\nevidence. However, a perusal of the judgment of the High Court shows that\nHigh Court has not properly considered the evidence on record and based\nits findings an ipse dixit.\n14. For example, in para 49 of the impugned judgment it is mentioned\nthat the identity of the accused Uttam Kumar as one of the persons who\nallegedly travelled with the deceased, is not established. However, in this\nconnection, it seems to us that the identity of Uttam Kumar appears to be\nestablished by witness Vasu Dev-PW-2, who has stated in his statement that\nit was Uttam Kumar who had approached him to hire a taxi to go to Kalka.\nWe see no good reason to disbelieve the evidence of Vasu Dev in this\nconnection because there does not appear to be any enmity between Vasu\nDev and Uttam Kumar. Similarly, PW-7 Inder Singh Chauhan has also identified\nUttam Kumar as the person who went with the deceased Ramesh Kumar in\nthe latter's car. PW-9 Inder Singh son of Mathu Ram has also deposed to the\nG same effect and has identified Uttam Kumar as the person who went with\nRamesh Kumar in the latter's car.\n15. All the above statements of the witnesses clearly identify who have\nidentified Uttam Kumar who travelled with the deceased Ramesh Kumar. It\nseems to us that the High Court has disregarded the said evidence on flimsy\nH grounds. In our opinion it appears is clearly established that Uttam Kumar\nSTATE OF HIMACHAL PRADESH v. UTTAM KUMAR (MARKANDEY KATJU, J.] 865\nwas the person who travelled with the deceased Ramesh Kumar in his car on A\n1.4.1997.\n16. The prosecution case is of last seen evidence and is also based on\nrecoveries at the instance of the accused.\n17. Vasu Dev has clearly stated that it was Uttam Kumar who travelled B\nwith the deceased Ramesh Kumar in the latter's car on 1.4.1997. It has also\ncome in the evidence of other witnesses that the deceased was also seen\nsubsequently in the company of the other accused also. For instance, PW-\n3 Nek Ram has stated in his evidence on 1.4.1997 that the deceased Ramesh\nKumar was driving his car at Theog in the evening and at that time accused\nUttam Kumar, Suresh Kumar and Parveen Sabarwal were in his car. Ramesh\nKumar had a talk with the said Nek Ram for about five to seven minutes.\nC\n18. It is also the prosecution case that Uttam Kumar while in police\ncustody made disclosure statements leading to the recovery of the dead body\nof Ramesh Kumar under a culvert, and other disclosures were also said to D\nhave been made by the other accused.\n19. We are not commenting in detail about the veracity or otherwise of\nthe witnesses since we are remanding the case back to the High Court for\nreconsideration. Suffice it to say that the impugned judgment does not show\na proper consideration of the evidence and seems to be based on conjectures E\nand surmises, and hence it is not sustainable. In these circumstances we set\naside the impugned judgment of the High Court and remand the case to the\nHigh Court for a fresh consideration of the evidence and a fresh decision in\naccordance with law. We make it clear that we have not expressed any final\nopinion on any factual issue, and it will be open to the High Court to give\nF\nits fresh judgment uninfluenced by any observations made herein.\n20. Since the incident is around 10 years old, the High Court may\nconsider the feasibility of hearing the case expeditiously. The appeals are\nallowed. Impugned judgment is set aside. The matter is remanded to the High\nCourt for a fresh decision.\nN.J.\nAppeals allowed.\nG .\n"}
