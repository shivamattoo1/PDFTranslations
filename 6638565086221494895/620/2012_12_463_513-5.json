{"pages":[{"pageNumber":51}],"text":"ASHOK v. RAJENDRA BHAUSAHEB MULAK 513\nmaterially affected the result of the election so as to entertain A\na challenge to the same. To contend that the alleged breach of\nsecrecy would render the entire election result as void so as to\norder for a repoll in spite of absence of any objection by the\ndefeated candidates or his representative in this regard at the\ntime of polling would be an outrageous contention in my view B\nwhich is fit to rejected outright. Fortunately, this is not even the\ncontention of the petitioner and rightly so, as he has confined\nhis challenge only to the extent of challenging the validity of 5\nor 14 votes alleging breach of secrecy, which materially\naffected the election result. This contention is extremely fragile C\nand hence has no force for the reasoning recorded\nhereinbefore.\n22. I am, therefore, conclusively of the view that the\nimpugned judgment and order of the High Court is not required\nto be interfered with and the election petition was rightly held\nto be fit for rejection for want of material facts and material\nparticulars which could materially affect the result of the election.\nORDER\nIn view of conflicting views expressed by us, we refer this\nmatter to a three Judge Bench for resolving the conflict. The\nRegistry shall place the record before Hon'ble the Chief Justice\nof India for constituting an appopriate Bench.\nB.B.B.\nMatter referred to Larger Bench.\nD\nE\n"}
