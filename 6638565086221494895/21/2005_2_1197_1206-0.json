Resultantly consent awards were E\npassed and compensation was received by the landowners in full\nsatisfaction of their claim. Later, the landowners filed applications for\nreference to civil court in terms of s.18 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894,\nclaiming enhanced compensation. The Collector rejected the applications.\nSingle Judge of the High Court also dismissed the writ petitions of the\nlandowners. However, the Division Bench allowed their writ appeal.\nAggrieved, the State Government filed the present appeals.\nF\nAllowing the appeals, the Court\nHELD : 1.1. A right of a landholder to obtain an order of reference\nwould arise only when he has not accepted the award. Once such award\nis accepted, no legal right in him survives for claiming a reference to the\ncivil court. An agreement between the parties as regards the value of the\nlands acquired by the State is binding on the parties, unless it is set aside\nin an appropriate proceeding by a competent court. Even in the writ\n1197\nG\nH\n1198\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2005] 2 S.C.R.\nA petitions, the prayers made by the respondents were for quashing the order\npassed by the Collector declining to make a reference u/s. 18 and for\nissuance of a direction upon him to refer the matter to the civil court. The\nquestion as regards the validity of the agreements had not been raised\nbefore the High Court. The High Court while exercising its jurisdiction\nunder Article 226 of the Constitution of India, thus, could not have\nsubstituted the award passed by the Land Acquisition Officer by reason\nof the impugned judgment. [1202-F-H; 1203-A-B]\nB\n1.2. The respondents having accepted the award without any demur\nwere estopped and precluded from maintaining an application for\nC reference in terms of Section 18 of the Act. Besides, they also waived their\nright to file any application for enhancement of the amount of\ncompensation. It is also trite that by reason of such agreement, the right\nto receive amount by way of solatium or interest etc. can be waived.\nHowever, in the instant case, it is not in dispute that in terms of the consent\nawards, the amount of compensation included solatium and additional\nD market value. [1201-G-H; 1202-A; 1203-D-E]\nE\nF\nG\n1.3. Keeping in view the fact that the condition precedent for\nmaintaining application for reference under s.18 is non-acceptance of the\naward by the awardee, the Division Bench of the High Court acted illegally\nand without jurisdiction in passing the impugned judgment. The Single\nJudge was right in concluding that the writ petitions were not\nmaintainable. [1205-G-H]\nState of Gujarat and Ors. v.

The Collector of Lakhimpur and\nAnr., [1976] 3 SCC 24, held inapplicable.\n2. An award under the Act is passed either on consent of the parties\nor on adjudication of rival claims. For the purpose of passing a consent\naward, it was not necessary to comply with the provisions of Article 299\nof the Constitution of India. An agreement between the parties need not\nfurthermore be strictly in terms of a prescribed format. [1203-C-D]\nH 2005.\nCIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION : Civil Appeal No. 2266-2268 of\nL\nрно\nSTATE v. SANGAPPA DYAVAPPA BIRADAR [SINHA, J.] 1199\nFrom the Judgment and Order dated 18.2.2003 of the Karnataka High A\nCourt in W.A. No. 2501, 2500 and 1677 of 2000.\nSanjay R. Hegde for the Appellants.\nMs. Kiran Suri, Himanshu Hultan and Mali Santosh for the Respondents.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nS.B. SINHA, J. Leave granted.\nB\nThese appeals are directed against the judgment and order dated\n18.2.2003 passed by a Division Bench of the High Court of Karnataka, C\nBangalore in Writ Appeal Nos. 1677, 2500 and 2501 of 2000 whereby and\nwhereunder the writ appeals filed by the Respondents herein were allowed,\nreversing the judgment and order passed by a learned Single Judge of the\nsaid court dismissing the writ petitions filed by the Respondents herein.\nE\nKeeping in view the point involved in these appeals, it is not necessary D\nto state the fact of the matter in great details. Suffice it to point out that for\nthe purpose of submergence and construction of canal for the Upper Krishna\nProject, the Appellant State intended to acquire some lands including the\nlands belonging to the Respondents herein. The parties entered into\nnegotiations as regard the price of the lands; pursuant whereto and in\nfurtherance whereof consent awards were passed by the Special Land 1\nAcquisition Officer. The amount of compensation awarded in terms of the\nconsent award was also received by the Respondents in full satisfaction of\ntheir claim. The Respondents, however, filed applications for reference to the\nCivil Court in terms of Section 18 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894\n(hereinafter referred to as \"the Act\") claiming enhanced compensation. The F\nsaid prayer was rejected by the Collector by an order dated 23.8.1999. The\nRespondents thereafter filed writ petitions before the High Court which were\nmarked as Writ Petition Nos. 41354, 36840 and 36748 of 1999 praying\ntherein for quashing of the said order as also for a direction upon the\nRespondent No. 2 to refer the applications filed by them to the Civil Court\nfor determining the amount of compensation in respect of the acquired lands.\nBy reason of judgments and orders dated 6.1.2000 and 19.1.2000, the\nsaid writ petitions were dismissed on the ground that the parties having\nentered into settlement as regard the price of the lands acquired and as a\nconsent award had been passed pursuant thereto, recourse to Section 18 of\nG\nH\n1200\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2005] 2 S.C.R.\nA the Act was impermissible. The Respondents herein filed writ appeals against\nthe said judgments. The Division Bench of the High Court rejected the\ncontention of the Respondents herein to the effect that the agreement between\nthe parties had not been drawn up in terms of the form prescribed under Rule\n10(b) of the Land Acquisition Rules and furthermore did not conform to the\nrequirements of Article 299 of the Constitution of India. It, however, allowed\nthe said writ appeals on the premise that the amount of compensation was not\npaid to the Respondents herein in terms of the agreement entered into by and\nbetween the parties and in any event, the Respondents could not have been\ndeprived of their statutory right of obtaining solatium and interest in terms\nof the Act, directing :\nB\nC\nD\n(1)\nE\n66\n...... We direct the respondents to compute the balance amounts\npayable to the claimants within an outer limit of twelve weeks from\ntoday and to disburse the same to the claimants immediately thereafter.\nWith these directions, the appeals to stand disposed of. Parties to bear\ntheir own costs.\nWe clarify, that the claimants would be entitled to not only the\nstatutory benefits but whatever interest that they are lawfully entitled\nto.\"\nThe Appellants are, thus, before us.\nMr. Sanjay R. Hegde, the learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the\nAppellants, would submit that the Division Bench of the High Court committed\na gross error in passing the impugned judgment insofar as it failed to take\n` into consideration the scope, object and purport of Section 18 of the Act.\nRelying on the judgments of this Court in State of Gujarat and Ors. v. Daya\nF Shamji Bhai and Ors., [1995] 5 SCC 746 and Ishwarlal Premchand Shah and\nOrs. v. State of Gujarat and Ors., [1996] 4 SCC 174], the learned counsel\nwould contend that as the awards passed by the Land Acquisition Officer\nwere consent awards, reference to the Civil Court in terms of Section 18\nthereof was impermissible.\nG\nH\nMs. Kiran Suri, the learned counsel appearing on behalf the Respondents,\non the other hand, would contend that the reference in terms of Section 18\nof the Act was maintainable as the Respondents were made to sign certain\nforms which contained blank columns as regard the amount of compensation\npayable to them. The learned counsel would submit that the Respondents\nwere, in any event, entitled to the amount of solatium as also interest on the\nSTATE v. SANGAPPA DYAVAPPA BIRADAR [SINHA, J.] 1201\nawarded amount. Even in relation to a consent award, it was argued, the Land A\nAcquisition Officer is required to exercise a statutory power in terms of the\nprovisions of the Act and the same having not been done, the Appellant was\nentitled to obtain an order of reference to the Civil Court. Reliance, in this\nconnection, has been placed on Assam Railways \u0026 Trading Co. Ltd. v. The\nCollector of Lakhimpur and Anr., [1976] 3 SCC 24.\nBy reason of the Government Order No. Kam.E.140 AKW 98 dated\n19.6.1998, it was directed that the lands should be classified mainly into two\ncategories i.e. dry land and wet land, the amount of compensation payable\ntherefor were specified therein. The parties thereafter entered into agreements\nculminating in passing of the consent awards, the relevant stipulations whereof\nare as under :\nB\nC\n\"Whereas the S.L.A.O. has negotiated the market price of the\nland to be acquired with the owner of the above land and the owner\nhas agreed to the rate of Rs. 1,14,000 per acre for the land in question,\nincluding the other statutory benefits of 30% solatium and 12% D\nadditional market value which rate fixed as above and it does not\ninclude the compensation payable to the owner for the structures,\ntrees and other improvements made on the land in question. Which\ncompensation would be subsequently assessed by the competent\ntechnical authority and the value so arrived at would be added to the\nE\nprice of the land determined through this consent.\nThe above compensation has been arrived at by mutual consent\nand as a consequence the owner hereby agrees to execute an indemnity\nbond and also agrees with the Government as follows:\n1. The owner is agreeable to the rate of Rs. 1,14,000 inclusive of F\n30% Solatium and 12% Additional Market Value per acre which is\nfixed by mutual consent between the Government and the owner. The\nowner binds himself to this compensation and undertakes not to seek\nany enhancements hereafter.\"\nAfter the said consent awards were passed, statements were also made G\nby the respective villagers declaring that they would not approach 'any court\nfor enhancement of the compensation for any other reason'.\nIt is not in dispute that in terms of the said consent awards, the amount\nof compensation included solatium and additional market value. The\nH\n1202\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2005] 2 S.C.R.\nA landholders, as noticed hereinbefore, also waived their right to file any\napplication for enhancement of the amount of compensation.\nThe sole question, thus, which arose for consideration before the High\nCourt was as to whether the applications filed by the Respondents herein in\nterms of Section 18 of the Act before the Special Land Acquisition Officer\nB seeking reference to the Civil Court for determination of quantum of\ncompensation, were maintainable.\nC\nD\nE\nF\nSection 18 of the Act reads as under :\nтАЬ18. Reference to Court (1) Any person interested who has not\naccepted the award may, by written application to the Collector, require\nthat the matter be referred by the Collector for the determination of\nthe Court, whether his objection be to the measurement of the land,\nthe amount of compensation, the persons to whom it is payable, or\nthe apportionment of the compensation among the persons interested.\n(2) The application shall state the grounds on which objection to\nthe award is taken :\nProvided that every such application shall be made -\n(a) if the person making it was present or represented before the\nCollector at the time when he made his award, within six weeks from\nthe date of the Collector's award;\n(b) in other cases, within six weeks of the receipt of the notice\nfrom the Collector under section 12, sub-section (2); or within six\nmonths from the date of the Collector's award, whichever period\nshall first expire.\"\nA right of a landholder to obtain an order of reference would arise only\nwhen he has not accepted the award. Once such award is accepted, no legal\nright in him survives for claiming a reference to the Civil Court. An agreement\nbetween the parties as regard the value of the lands acquired by the State is\nG binding on the parties. So long as such agreement and consequently the\nconsent awards are not set aside in an appropriate proceeding by a court of\nlaw having jurisdiction in relation thereto, the same remain binding. It is one\nthing to say that agreements are void or voidable in terms of the provisions\nof the Indian Contract Act having been obtained by fraud, collusion, etc, or\nare against public policy but it is another thing to say that without questioning\nH\nSTATE v. SANGAPPA DYAVAPPA BIRADAR [SINHA, J.] 1203\nBтВБ\nthe validity thereof, the Respondents could have maintained their writ petitions. A\nWe have noticed hereinbefore that even in the writ petitions, the prayers\nmade by the Respondents were for quashing the order dated 23.8.1999 passed\nby the Special Land Acquisition Officer and for issuance of a direction upon\nhim to refer the matter to the Civil Court. The High Court while exercising\nits jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, thus, could not\nhave substituted the award passed by the Land Acquisition Officer by reason\nof the impugned judgment. Furthermore, the question as regard the validity\nof the agreements had not been raised before the High Court. As indicated\nhereinbefore, the Division Bench of the High Court had also rejected the\ncontention raised on behalf of the Respondents herein to the effect that the\nagreements did not conform to the requirements of Article 299 of the C\nConstitution of India or had not been drawn up in the prescribed proforma.\nAn award under the Act is passed either on consent of the parties or on\nadjudication of rival claims. For the purpose of passing a consent award, it\nwas not necessary to comply with the provisions of Article 299 of the\nConstitution of India. An agreement between the parties need not furthermore D\nbe strictly in terms of a prescribed format.\nThe Respondents having accepted the award without any demur were\nestopped and precluded from maintaining an application for reference in\nterms of Section 18 of the Act. It is also trite that by reason of such agreement,\nthe right to receive amount by way of solatium or interest etc. can be waived.\nIn Daya Shamji Bhai (supra), this Court held:\nE\n\"The right and entitlement to seek reference would, therefore,\narise when amount of compensation was received under protest in\nwriting which would manifest the intention of the owner of non- F\nacceptance of the award. Section 11(2) opens with a non-obstante\nclause \"notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1)тАЭ and\nprovides that \"if at any stage of the proceedings, the Collector is\nsatisfied that all the persons interested in the land who appeared\nbefore him have agreed in writing on the matters to be included in the\naward of the collector in the form prescribed by rules made by the\nappropriate Government, he may, without making further enquiry,\nmake an award according to the terms of such agreement. By virtue\nof sub-section (4), \"notwithstanding anything contained in the\nRegistration Act, 1908, no agreement made under sub-section (2)\nG\nH\n1\n1204\nA\nB\nC\nсОа .\nE\nF\nG\nH\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2005] 2 S.C.R.\nshall be liable to registration under that ActтАЭ. The award made under\nSection 11(2) in terms of the agreement is, therefore, an award with\nconsent obviating the necessity of reference under Sectin 18.\"\nIn Ishwarlal Premchand Shah (supra), it was held :\n\"8. It is true that on determination of compensation under sub-\nsection (1) for the land acquired, Section 23(2) enjoins to award, in\naddition to the market value, 30% solatium in consideration of\ncompulsory nature of acquisition. Equally, Parliament having taken\nnotice of the inordinate delay in making the award by the Land\nAcquisition Officer from the date of notification published under\nSection 4(1) till passing the award under Section 11, to offset the\nprice pegged during the interregnum, Section 23(1-A) was introduced\nto award an amount calculated @ 12% per annum on such market\nvalue, in addition to the market value of the land, for the period\ncommencing on and from the date of the publication of Section 4(1)\nnotification to the date of award of the Collector or date of taking\npossession of the land whichever is earlier. Under Section 28, interest\nwas directed to be paid on the excess compensation at the rate specified\ntherein from the date of taking possession of the land to the date of\ndeposit into court of such excess compensation. These three\ncomponents are in addition to the compensation determined under\nsub-section (1) of Section 23. They intended to operate in different\nperspectives. One for compulsory acquisition, the other for the delay\non the part of the Land Acquisition Officer in making the award and\nthe third one for deprivation of the enjoyment of the land from the\ndate of taking possession till determination of the compensation. The\nthree components are in addition to the determination of market value\nunder sub-section (1) of Section 23. They are not integral to\ndetermination of compensation under sub-section (1) of Section 23\nbut in addition to, for the circumstances enumerated hereinbefore. In\na private sale between a willing vendor and a willing vendee, parties\nwould arrive at consensus to pay and receive consolidated\nconsideration which would form the market value of the land conveyed\nto the vendee. For public purpose, compulsory acquisition under the\nAct gives absolute title under Section 16 free from all encumbrances.\nDetermination of the compensation would be done under Section\n23(1) on the basis of market value prevailing as on the date of the\npublication of the notification under Section 4(1). It would, therefore,\nL\nSTATE v. SANGAPPA DYAVAPPA BIRADAR [SINHA, J.] 1205\nbe open to the parties to enter into a contract under Section 11(2), A\nwithout the necessity to determine compensation under Section 23(1)\nand would receive market value at the rates incorporated in the contract\nsigned under Section 11(2) in which event the award need not be in\nForm 14.\n9. This Court in State of Gujarat v. Daya Shamji Bhail had B\nconsidered the similar contentions and held that once the parties have\nagreed under Section 11(2) of the Act, the Land Acquisition Officer\nhas power under Section 11(2) to pass the award in terms thereof and\nthat the award need not contain payment of interest, solatium and\nadditional amount unless it is also part of the contract between the\nparties. The same ratio applies to the facts in this case. In view of the\nabove clauses in the agreements the appellants are not entitled to the\npayment of additional amounts by way of solatium, interest and\nadditional amount under the provisions of the Act.тАЭ\nC\nD\nAssam Railways \u0026 Trading Co. Ltd. (supra) whereupon Ms. Suri placed\nreliance is not applicable to the fact of the present case. Therein negotiations\nhad taken place between the parties whereupon the Railway Administration\nbecame prepared to pay Rs. 2500 per bigha towards the sale price of the land\nbut the transaction was not completed, having regard to the fact that under\nthe State Railway Rules, land from private parties could be acquired only by\ntaking recourse to acquisition proceedings. Thereafter, in the land acquisition E\nproceedings, an award was made by the Land Acquisition Collector allowing\ncompensation at the rate of Rs. 1000 per bigha. It is in that situation, the\nnegotiation between the parties was highlighted stating that although the\nsame did not fructify into a binding contract, there was at least a тАЬgentleman's\nagreement\" regarding the price which indicated what a willing purchaser F\nwas ready to pay for the land. In the factual backdrop of that case this Court\nobserved:\n\"\n...Assuming this was an agreement which bound the parties,\nthe Collector had still the jurisdiction to determine the market value\nof the land...\"\nKeeping in view the fact that the condition precedent for maintaining\napplication for reference under Section 18 is non-acceptance of the award by\nthe awardee, in our considered opinion, the Division Bench acted illegally\nand without jurisdiction in passing the impugned judgment. The learned Single\nJudge was right in concluding that the writ petitions were not maintainable.\nG\nH\nA\n1206\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2005] 2 S.C.R.\nFor the reasons aforementioned, the impugned judgments cannot be\nsustained which are set aside accordingly. The appeals are allowed. However,\nin the facts and circumstances of the case, there shall be no order as to costs.\nR.P.\nAppeal allowed.\nL\n"}
