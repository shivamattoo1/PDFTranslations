However, the High Court allowed\nrespondent's writ petition holding that there was no requirement in\nColumn 12 of the Attestation Form to mention about any pending case or\narrest, and, therefore, the action of the authorities could not be sustained.\nAggrieved, the State Government filed the appeal.\nF\nG\nDismissing the appeal, the Court\nHELD: 1.1.

The question whether the respondent was a desirable person to\nbe appointed in Government service was not the subject matter of\nadjudication and the Tribunal was not justified in recording any finding\nin that regard. Whether a person is fit to be appointed or not is a matter\nwithin the special domain of the Government. For denying somebody\nappointment after he is selected, though he has no right to be appointed,\nhas to be governed by some statutory provisions. That was not the issue\nwhich was to be adjudicated in the present case. The only issue related\nto suppression of facts or mis-declaration. [1152-G-H; 1153-A]\nCIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 1014 of 2005.\nFrom the Judgment and Order dated 8.9.2003 of the Andhra Pradesh\nHigh Court in W.P.No. 17943 of 2003.\nManoj Saxena, S.K. Mittra, Debojit Borkakati and Mohanprasad Meharia\nSECY. DEPTT. OF HOME SECY. A.P. v. B. C. NAIDU [PASAYAT, J.] 1149\nfor the Appellants.\nMs. Asha Gopalan Nair for the Respondent.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nARIJIT PASAYAT, J. Leave granted.\nA\nB\nChallenge in this appeal is to legality of the judgment of a Division\nBench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court setting aside the order passed by\nthe Andhra Pradesh Administrative Tribunal (in short the 'Tribunal') and\nholding that authorities were not justified in denying appointment to the\nrespondent.\nA brief reference to the factual aspects would suffice :\nC\nE\nThe respondent appeared for the recruitment test conducted for the\nselection of Stipendiary Cadet Trainee Police Constable (Civil) in\nVisakhapatnam. He was successful in the test and thereafter he was subjected D\nto medical test. After the two tests were over, he was required to undergo\ntraining. But he was not sent for training on the ground that the Superintendent\nof Police, Visakhapatnam by order dated 5.5.2003 had directed that he was\nnot to be sent for training. Questioning legality of such order, the respondent\nfiled an Original Application before the Tribunal. The Tribunal noted that the\nexamination for selection was conducted on 16.3.2003. Subsequently, he\nunderwent the physical test and was successful. By order dated 28.4.2003 the\nSuperintendent of Police, Visakhapatnam informed the respondent about his\nselection and directed him to report at the District Police Office at\nVisakhapatnam for further medical test. He was also directed to carry with\nhim uniforms and other items necessary for training which was organized at F\nCentral Police Lines, Amberpet. Though, the respondent was subjected to\nmedical examination he was not allowed to join the training programme. He\nwas informed that since he had been arrested in crime No. 28/2000 on the\nfile of Police Station, Kukatpally, registered under various provisions of the\nIndian Penal Code, 1860 (in short the 'IPC') and Andhra Pradesh Public\nExamination Prevention of Malpractice and Unfair Means Act, 1997 he was\nnot eligible to be appointed. Before the Tribunal the respondent took the\nstand that since he had not been charged and had not been convicted and\nsince he had no connection with the crime, the order of the Superintendent\nof Police was not tenable. His further stand was that the case was registered\nin respect of the earlier recruitment test in the year 2000 and there was no H\nG\nB\n1150\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2005] 1 S.C.R.\nA reason to debar him since there was no conviction, and, therefore, the action\nof the authority is not proper. The present appellants filed counter-affidavit\nstating that before final verification the respondent was permitted to appear\nin the examination and the tests. Subsequently, it was noticed that the\nrespondent herein was arrested on 16.1.2000 and was sent to judicial custody\nin the case referred to above. That case was under investigation and Forensic\nScience Laboratory report was awaited. The applicant while submitting\nAttestation Form after completion of written examination did not mention\nabout his arrest and the pending case which he was required to do. Since he\nhad suppressed the truth in terms of the instructions laid down in Declaration\nat Cl. No. 3, the respondent had incurred disqualification and he was not a\nC fit person for employment under the Government. The Tribunal noted that\nagainst Col. No. 12 of the Attestation Form, the respondent had not mentioned\nabout the pending case and had not even indicated about his arrest. This\namounted to suppression of truth in the Attestation Form and Declaration at\ncolumn No.3. Therefore, in terms of the instructions he had incurred\ndisqualification and was unfit for employment under the Government. The\nTribunal held that the respondent was not a person of good conduct and\ncharacter since he had suppressed material information while filling up the\nAttestation Form. He did not deserve any relief. Accordingly the Original\nApplication was dismissed.\nD\nE\nF\nThe matter was challenged before the Andhra Pradesh High Court and\nby the impugned judgment it was held that there was no requirement under\nColumn No. 12 to mention about any pending case or arrest and, therefore,\nthe action of the authorities, in not permitting the respondent to join the\ntraining, cannot be sustained.\nIn support of the appeal the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the\nappellants submitted that the Tribunal had correctly held that the respondent\nwas guilty of suppression of material facts and taking into consideration the\nconduct and character the Tribunal had rightly held that he was not entitled\nto any relief, and High Court should not have interfered with the order.\nReference was made to some cases where this Court has held that giving of\nG incorrect reply and suppressing material facts while filling up the Application\nH\nForm or Attestation Form or Declaration disentitles the candidate for any\nrelief. Particular reference was made to the case of Kendriya Vidyalaya\nSangathan and Ors. v. Ram Ratan Yadav, [2003] 3 SCC 437.\nIn response, the learned counsel for the respondent submitted that there\nSECY. DEPTT. OF HOME SECY. A.P. v. B. C. NAIDU [PASAYAT. J.] 1151\nwas no requirement to mention about the arrest or the pending case, therefore, A\nHigh Court's order is perfectly justified.\nIn Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan's case (supra) the factual position\ncan be ascertained from paragraphs 8 and 9 which read as follows:\n\"8. The Attestation Form dated 26.6.1998 duly filled in by the B\nrespondent and attestation show that the respondent has taken BA\ndegree from St. Aloysius College, JBP and Bed and Med degrees\nfrom R. Durgavati Vishwavidyalaya, JBP. Columns 12 and 13 as\nfilled up read thus :\n“12. - Have you ever been prosecuted/kept under detention or bound C\ndown/fined, convicted by a court of law of any offence? - No.\"\n“13. - Is any case pending against you in any court of law at the time\nof filling up this Attestation Form?- No.\"\n\"9. - The respondent has also certified the information given in the\nD\nsaid Attestation Form as under :\n\"I certify that the foregoing information is correct and complete to\nthe best of my knowledge and belief. I am not aware of any\ncircumstances which might impair my fitness for employment under\nGovernment.\"\nE\nAs is noted in Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan's case (supra) the object of\nrequiring information in various columns like Column No. 12 of the Attestation\nForm and declaration thereafter by the candidate is to ascertain and verify the\ncharacter and antecedents to judge his suitability to enter into or continue in\nservice. When a candidate suppresses material information and/or gives false F\ninformation he cannot claim any right for appointment or continuance in\nservice. There can be no dispute to this position in law. But on the facts of\nthe case it cannot be said that the respondent had made false declaration or\nhad suppressed material information.\nIn order to appreciate the rival submissions it is necessary to take note G\nof Column No. 12 of the Attestation Form and Column No.3 of the declaration.\nThe relevant portions are quoted below :\n\"Column No.12 - Have you ever been convicted by a court of law or\ndetained under any State/Central preventive detention laws for any\noffence whether such conviction sustained in court of appeal or set\nH\n1152\nA\nB\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\naside by the appellate court if appealed against.\"\n[2005] 1 S.C.R.\n\"Column No.3 - I am fully aware that furnishing of false information\nor suppression of any actual information in the Attestation Form\nwould be a disqualification and is likely to render me unfit for\nemployment under the Government.\"\nA bare perusal of the extracted portions show that the candidate is\nrequired to indicate as to whether he has ever been convicted by a court of\nlaw or detained under any State/Central preventive detention laws for any\noffences whether such conviction is sustained or set aside by the appellate\ncourt, if appealed against. The candidate is not required to indicate as to\nC whether he had been arrested in any case or as to whether any case was\nD\npending. Conviction by a court or detention under any State/Central Preventive\nDetention Laws is different from arrest in any case or pendency of a case. By\nanswering that the respondent had not been convicted or detained under\nPreventive Detention Laws it cannot be said that he had suppressed any\nmaterial fact or had furnished any false information or suppressed any\ninformation in the Attestation Form to incur disqualification. The State\nGovernment and the Tribunal appeared to have proceeded on the basis that\nthe respondent ought to have indicated the fact of arrest or pendency of the\ncase, though column No. 12 of the Attestation Form did not require such\ninformation being furnished. The learned counsel for the appellants submitted\nE that such a requirement has to be read into an Attestation Form. We find no\nF\nreason to accept such contention. There was no specific requirement to mention\nas to whether any case is pending or whether the applicant had been arrested.\nIn view of the specific language so far as Column No. 12 is concerned the\nrespondent cannot be found guilty of any suppression.\nIn Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan's case (supra), the position was the\nreverse. There the candidate took the stand that as there was no conviction,\nhis negative answers to columns 12 to 13 were not wrong. This Court did not\naccept the stand that requirement was conviction and not prosecution in view\nof the information required under columns 12 and 13 as quoted above. The\nG requirement was \"prosecution\" and not \"conviction\". The logic has application\nhere. The requirement in the present case is \"conviction\" and not \"prosecution\".\nThe question whether he was a desirable person to be appointed in\nGovernment service was not the subject matter of adjudication and the Tribunal\nwas not justified in recording any finding in that regard. Whether a person\nH is fit to be appointed or not is a matter within the special domain of the\nSECY. DEPTT. OF HOME SECY. A.P. v. B. C. NAIDU [PASAYAT, J.} 1153\nGovernment. For denying somebody appointment after he is selected, though A\nhe has no right to be appointed, has to be governed by some statutory\nprovisions. That was not the issue which was to be adjudicated in the present\ncase. The only issue related to suppression of facts or mis-declaration.\nIn view of the aforesaid, we find no merit in this appeal which is\naccordingly dismissed with no order as to costs.\nR.P.\nAppeal dismissed.\nB\n"}
