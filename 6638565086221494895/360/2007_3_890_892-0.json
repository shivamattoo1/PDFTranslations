It is not in dispute that the\nappellant has purchased the property in question for Rs.4,90,000/- as could\nbe seen from the sale deed. According to the appellant, he was a bonafide\npurchaser. It is also not in dispute that against the dismissal of the Writ\nPetition filed by the appellant challenging the said assessment, the appellant\npreferred the Writ Appeal which is pending final disposal before the High\nCourt and during the pendency of the Writ Appeal, the Division Bench of the\nC High Court directed the appellant to deposit 50% of the total tax due to the\nrespondent within a period of eight weeks, failing which the stay granted shall\nstand automatically vacated.
