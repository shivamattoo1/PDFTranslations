DIOCESE OF MADURAI [PASAYAT, J.] 901\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nARIJIT PASAYAT, J. These two appeals are directed against the orders\nof a learned Single Judge of the Madras High Court. A Second Appeal was\ndismissed and the review petition filed was also dismissed.\nA\nC\nLearned Single Judge of the Madras High Court dismissed the Second B\nAppeal filed by the appellants under Section 100 of the Code of Civil\nProcedure, 1908 (in short the 'CPC'). The Second Appeal was filed by the\ndefendants 1 to 3 i.e. the present appellants against the judgment and decree\nmade in A.S. No.2 of 1993 on the file of Subordinate Judge, Periakulam\nconfirming the judgment and decree dated 18.3.1992 made in O.S. No.597\nof 1982 on the file of District Munsif Court, Periakulam. The respondent in\nthe Second Appeal filed the suit for possession of the suit property as well\ns the recovery of arrears of rent and damages. The learned District Munsif,\nPeriakulam, on consideration of the facts decreed the suit. Aggrieved by the\nsaid judgment and decree, the appellants herein preferred an appeal before\nthe Sub Court, Periakulam. The learned Sub Judge also confirmed the findings D\nof the learned District Munsif and dismissed the appeal. A Second Appeal\nwas filed before the High Court.\nAt the time of admission of the Second Appeal the following question\nwas framed for determination:\n\"Whether the lower appellate court is correct in deciding the appeal\nwithout any points for determination as contemplated under Order 41\nRule 31 of CPC?”\nE\nIt was contended before the High Court that Order 41 Rule 31, C.P.C.\nis mandatory and compliance is necessary. When the points of determination F\nhave not been specifically indicated the appellate judgment becomes\nvulnerable. Stand of the respondent before the High Court was that there has\nbeen a substantial compliance with the provisions of Order 41 Rule 31, CPC\nand, therefore, the appeal was without any merit.\nThe High Court accepted the stand of the respondent. Though some G\nquestions framed related to merits, as noted the dispute was restricted to the\nalleged non-compliance of Order 41 Rule 31 CPC. Accordingly, the Second\nAppeal was dismissed. Review Petition was also dismissed.\nIn support of the appeals, learned counsel for the appellants submitted\nH\n902\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2006] 2 S.C.R.\nA that the High Court did not keep in view the true scope and ambit of Order\n41 Rule 31 CPC. Points for determination were not specifically indicated by\nthe First appellate Court and, therefore, the judgment was non-est.\nB\nC\nD\nE\nLearned counsel for the respondents on the other hand supported the\nimpugned judgment.\nOrder 41 Rule 31 CPC reads as follows:\n\"Contents, date and signature of judgment- The judgment of the\nAppellate court shall be in writing and shall state-\n(a) the points for determination;\n(b) the decision thereon;\n(c) the reasons for the decision; and\n(d) where the decree appealed from is reversed or varied, the relief\nto which the appellant is entitled, and shall at the time that it is\npronounced be signed and dated by the Judge or by the Judges\nconcurring therein.\"\nThe question whether in a particular case there has been a substantial\ncompliance with the provisions of Order 41 Rule 31 CPC has to be determined\non the nature of the judgment delivered in each case. Non-compliance with\nthe provisions may not vitiate the judgment and make it wholly void, and may\nbe ignored if there has been substantial compliance with it and the second\nappellate Court is in a position to ascertain the findings of the lower appellate\nCourt. It is no doubt desirable that the appellate court should comply with\nall the requirements of Order 41 Rule 31 CPC. But if it is possible to make out\nF from the judgment that there is substantial compliance with the said\nrequirements and that justice has not thereby suffered, that would be sufficient.\nWhere the appellate court has considered the entire evidence on record and\ndiscussed the same in detail, come to any conclusion and its findings are\nsupported by reasons even though the point has not been framed by the\nappellate Court there is substantial compliance with the provisions of Order\n41 Rule 31 CPC and the judgment is not in any manner vitiated by the absence\nof a point of determination. Where there is an honest endeavour on the part\nof the lower appellate court to consider the controversy between the parties\nand there is proper appraisement of the respective cases and weighing and\nbalancing of the evidence, facts and the other considerations appearing on\nH both sides is clearly manifest by the perusal of the judgment of the lower\nG\n;\n+\nG. AMALORPAVAM v. R.C. DIOCESE OF MADURAI [PASAYAT, J.] 903\nappellate court, it would be a valid judgment even though it does not contain A\nthe points for determination. The object of the Rule in making it incumbent\nupon the appellate court to frame points for determination and to cite reasons\nfor the decision is to focus attention of the Court on the rival contentions\nwhich arise for determination and also to provide litigant parties opportunity\nin understanding the ground upon which the decision is founded with a view\nB\nto enable them to know the basis of the decision and if so considered\nappropriate and so advised to avail the remedy of Second Appeal conferred\nby Section 100 CPC.\nAt this juncture it would be relevant to note what this Court said in\nGirijanandini Devi and Ors. v. Bijendra Narain Choudhary AIR (1967) SC\n1124. In para 12 it was noted as follows:\n66\n……………..It is not the duty of the appellate court when it agrees with\nthe view of the Trial Court on the evidence either to restate the effect\nof the evidence or to reiterate the reasons given by the Trial Court.\nExpression of general agreement with reasons given by the Court\ndecision of which is under appeal would ordinarily suffice.\"\nThe view was reiterated in Santosh Hazari v. Purshottam Tiwari\n(Deceased) by Lrs. [2001] (3) SCC 179). In para 15 it was held with reference\nto Girijanandini Devi's case (supra) as follows:\nC\nD\nE\n\"The appellate court has jurisdiction to reverse or affirm the findings\nof the trial court. First appeal is a valuable right of the parties and\nunless restricted by law, the whole case is therein open for rehearing\nboth on questions of fact and law. The judgment of the appellate\ncourt must, therefore, reflect its conscious application of mind and\nrecord findings supported by reasons, on all the issues arising along F\nwith the contentions put forth, and pressed by the parties for decision\nof the appellate court. The task of an appellate court affirming the\nfindings of the trial court is an easier one. The appellate court agreeing\nwith the view of the trial court need not restate the effect of the\nevidence or reiterate the reasons given by the trial court; expression\nof general agreement with reasons given by the court, decision of\nwhich is under appeal, would ordinarily suffice (Girijanandini Devi\nv. Bijendra Narain Choudhary, AIR (1967) SC 1124). We would,\nhowever, like to sound a note of caution. Expression of general\nagreement with the findings recorded in the judgment under appeal\nshould not be a device or camouflage adopted by the appellate court H\nG\n904\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n-\n-\n[2006] 2 S.C.R.\nfor shirking the duty cast on it. While writing a judgment of reversal\nthe appellate court must remain conscious of two principles. Firstly,\nthe findings of fact based on conflicting evidence arrived at by the\ntrial court must weigh with the appellate court, more so when the\nfindings are based on oral evidence recorded by the same Presiding\nJudge who authors the judgment. This certainly does not mean that\nwhen an appeal lies on facts, the appellate court is not competent to\nreverse a finding of fact arrived at by the trial Judge. As a matter of\nlaw if the appraisal of the evidence by the trial Court suffers from a\nmaterial irregularity or is based on inadmissible evidence or on\nconjectures and surmises, the appellate court is entitled to interfere\nwith the finding of fact. (Madhusudan Das v. Narayanibai, [1983] 1\nSCC 35 AIR (1983) SC 114). The rule is and it is nothing more\nthan a rule of practice that when there is conflict of oral evidence\nof the parties on any matter in issue and the decision hinges upon the\ncredibility of witnesses, then unless there is some special feature\nabout the evidence of a particular witness which has escaped the trial\nJudge's notice or there is a sufficient balance of improbability to\ndisplace his opinion as to where the credibility lie, the appellate court\nshould not interfere with the finding of the trial Judge on a question\nof fact. (Sarju Pershad Ramdeo Sahu v. Jwaleshwari Pratap Narain\nSingh, AIR (1951) SC 120) Secondly, while reversing a finding of\nfact the appellate court must come into close quarters with the\nreasoning assigned by the trial court and then assign its own reasons\nfor arriving at a different finding. This would satisfy the court hearing\na further appeal that the first appellate court had discharged the duty\nexpected of it. We need only remind the first appellate courts of the\nadditional obligation cast on them by the scheme of the present Section\n100 substituted in the Code. The first appellate court continues, as\nbefore, to be a final court of facts; pure findings of fact remain\nimmune from challenge before the High Court in second appeal.\nNow the first appellate court is also a final court of law in the sense\nthat its decision on a question of law even if erroneous may not be\nvulnerable before the High Court in second appeal because the\njurisdiction of the High Court has now ceased to be available to\ncorrect the errors of law or the erroneous findings of the first appellate\ncourt even on questions of law unless such question of law be a\nsubstantial one.\"\nH It has been categorically recorded by the High Court that the First\n:\n7\nG. AMALORPAVAM v. R.C. DIOCESE OF MADURAI [PASAYAT, J.] 905\n00\nB\nappellate Court had considered the evidence led on behalf of the parties and A\nhas given finding to come to the conclusions arrived at. It noted that the\nlower appellate Court had independently considered the evidence and had\ngiven different findings on the issues framed by the trial Court and on the\nbasis of the arguments which were advanced before it. It was further noted\nthat there was detailed discussion giving reasons for affirming the order of\nthe trial Court. Learned counsel for the appellants had urged that the suit filed\nby the plaintiff was not maintainable as the plaintiff was the diocese represented\nby its procurator. It was submitted that the plaintiff is not entitled to any relief\nas was prayed for in the suit. This point was not urged before the High Court\nand, therefore, it would not consider necessary to go into that aspect. Judged\nin the background of legal principles set out above the judgment of the High C\nCourt does not suffer from any infirmity.\nIn that view of the matter the appeals are without merit and are dismissed.\nCosts made easy.\nS.K.S.\nAppeals dismissed.\nD\ni\n"}
