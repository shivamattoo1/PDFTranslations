After\nverification, as the respondents were found to be of overage, their services E\nwere terminated. The termination was challenged. On the direction of High\nCourt, respondents were given opportunity to be heard and thereafter again\ntermination order was passed. The same being challenged, High Court set\naside the order of termination and directed their reinstatement with back\nwages on the ground that on two earlier occasions, the employer had granted F\nexemption from age and qualifications and it was not explained by the employer\nas to why discretion could not be exercised in the present case. Writ Appeal\nwas dismissed summarily by the Division Bench of High Court. Hence the\npresent appeal.\nAllowing the appeal, the Court\nHELD: 1.1. Tirumala Tirupathi Devasthanams Employees Service Rules,\n1989 make complete provisions regarding qualification and age for direct\nrecruitment and also in respect of category of persons to whom relaxation\ncan be granted which would be in accordance with the Government Orders.\nI\nG\nH\n2\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 6 S.C.R.\nA The Rules do not mention anywhere that while making direct recruitment\nany services rendered as an NMR employees has to be taken into consideration\nor some relaxation in age is to be granted on its basis. The respondents had\nworked for a brief period as NMR employees. It was after a gap of more than\nsix years that they were appointed by way of direct recruitment.

The reasons given by the Single Judge of High Court for allowing\nthe writ petition are wholly untenable in law.

This appeal, by special leave, has been preferred\nagainst the judgment and order dated 21.1.2003 of a Division Bench of Andhra\nH Pradesh High Court by which the writ appeal preferred by the appellant was\n'\nI\n:\n་\nTIRUMALA TIRUPATI DEVASTHANAMS v. K JOTHEESWARA PILLAI (D) BY LRS. (G.P. MATHUR, J.] 3\ndismissed and the judgment and order dated 20.11.1997 of a learned Single A\nJudge by which the writ petition filed by the respondents was allowed with\ncertain directions, was affirmed.\n2. The original writ petitioners before the learned single Judge worked\nfor certain periods with the appellant Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams as\nB\nNominal Muster Rolls (for short 'NMR') employees. A circular was issued by\nthe appellant on 25.7.1990 wherein it was mentioned that in case of any\nvacancies, ex-employees should be appointed in order of seniority. The five\nwrit petitioners were temporarily appointed as Attenders by the appellant on\n17.8.1992 on the basis of aforesaid circular being ex-employees. After verification\nof the records and other documents it was found that all the five writ petitioners C\nwere overage and were not eligible for appointment and accordingly their\nservices were terminated on 16.4.1993. This order was challenged by the\nemployees by filing Writ Petition No. 5176 of 1993, which was allowed only\non the ground that the action had been taken against the writ petitioners\nwithout issuing any notice and without giving an opportunity of hearing. The\norder of termination dated 16.4.1993 was set aside leaving it open to the D\nappellant to take fresh action after giving notice to the concerned employees.\nThe appellant then issued notices to the concerned employees on 26.10.1993\nand after considering their reply, passed an order on 30.12.1993 terminating\ntheir services on the ground that they were over age and, therefore, ineligible\nfor appointment. The employees then filed writ petition No. 3885 of 1994\nchallenging the order of termination dated 30.12.1993. A learned Single Judge\nof the High Court allowed the writ petition and set aside the order of termination\nof service and directed the appellant to reinstate the employees (respondents\nherein) with continuity of service and full back wages. The main ground which\nweighed with the learned Single Judge was that though the writ petitioners\nwere appointed as direct recruits on 17.8.1992, but the fact that they had earlier F\nworked for some time on NMR could not be ignored. It was also held that the\nappellant had practiced invidious discrimination among persons belonging to\nthe same class inasmuch as by proceedings dated 6.4.1993 exemption had\nbeen granted to 51 persons from age and educational qualifications and on\nE\n4.5.1990 exemption had been granted to five persons who were under age. G\nAfter mentioning the said facts the learned Single Judge held as under: -\nc6\n..Nothing is placed before the Court to show as to\nwhy such a discretion could not be exercised by the board of trustees\nin the case of the petitioners. In fact, the decision of the Board of\nTrustees refusing to exercise the power of exemption is not laid before\nH\n4\nA\nB\nс\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 6 S.C.R.\nthe Court for perusal. There is only a reference to that effect in the\nimpugned order.\nIn the result, the writ petition is allowed. The impugned order is\nquashed. A writ of mandamus shall issue to the respondents to\nreinstate the petitioners 1 to 4 into service with continuity of service\nand with full back wages. Further, the respondent is directed to consider\nthe case of the petitioner No. 5 as to whether he is entitled to be\nexempted from the operation of age qualification vested in the trustees\nunder rule (I) of the general rules in G.O. Ms. No. 1060, Revenue,\n(Endt.I) department, dated 24.10.1989 within a period of one month\nfrom the date of receipt of a copy of this order. No costs.\nThe rule nisi has been made absolute as above.\"\nThe writ appeal filed by the appellant was summarily dismissed by the\nDivision Bench of the High Court by a brief order.\n3. Learned senior counsel for the appellant has submitted that the\nservice conditions of the employees working in Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam's\nare governed by the Tirumala Tirupathi Devasthanams Employees Service\nRules, 1989 (hereinafter referred to as \"the Rules\") and under Rule 11 no\nperson, who has completed the age of 28 years, is eligible for appointment by\nway of direct recruitment and in these circumstances the appointment order\nissued in favour of the contesting respondents (writ petitioners) was clearly\nillegal and the same was rightly set aside. Learned counsel has also submitted\nthat the High Court has clearly erred in directing the appellant to grant\nexemption from eligibility criterion in favour of the respondents as, in law, no\nsuch direction can be issued.\n4. Learned counsel for the respondents has supported the judgments of\nthe High Court and has submitted that in the facts and circumstances of the\ncase the view taken by the High Court is perfectly correct.\n5. Rules 1, 2, 3 and 11 of the Rules read as under:\n\"1.These rules may be called Tirumala Tirupathi Devasthanams\nEmployees Service Rules, 1989.\n2. They shall apply to every employee of Tirumala Tirupathi\nDevasthanams except to the Officers or Staff taken on contract\nbasis and officers or staff taken on deputation from the\nTIRUMALA TIRUPATI DEVASTHANAMS v. K. JOTHEESWARA PILLAI (D) BY LRS [G.P. MATHUR, J.] 5\nGovernment or other organizations.\n3. Unless the context otherwise requires: -\ni\n'Act' means the Andhra Pradesh Charitable and Hindu Religious\nInstitutions and Endowments Act, 1987.\nA\n(ii) Words and phrases used but not defined in these rules shall B\nhave the same meaning assigned to them in the Act, the rules.\nframed thereunder or in respect of rules specified under Rule 4.\n-\n11. Age. No person shall be eligible for appointment to the service\nby direct recruitment to any post in the service of Tirumala Tirupathi\nDevasthanams in Annexure-II if he has completed the age of 28 years C\nor the age prescribed therefor in the said Annexure as on the 1st July.\nof the year, in which the notification for recruitment is issued:\nProvided that the orders issued by Government from time to time\nregarding the general relaxation of the age and age relaxation in\nrespect of person belonging to reserved categories such as Scheduled D\nCaste, Scheduled Tribe and Backward Class shall apply.\"\nRule 4 gives a long list of rules made by the Government of Andhra\nPradesh in respect of the employees of the State Government which have\nbeen made applicable to Tirumala Tirupathi Devasthanams employees, which\nincludes Fundamental Rules and Subsidiary Rules issued thereunder, Andhra E\nPradesh Civil Services (Conduct) Rules, 1964, Andhra Pradesh Civil Services\n(Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 1963, etc. Rule 11 of the Rules\nclearly provides that no person shall be eligible for appointment to the service\nby direct recruitment to any post in the service of Tirumala Tirupathi\nDevasthanams in Annexure-II if he has completed the age of 28 years or the\nF\nage prescribed therefor in the said Annexure as on 1st July of the year\nin\nwhich the notification for recruitment is issued. It also provides for general\nrelaxation of age in accordance with the orders issued by the Government and\nalso in respect of persons belonging to reserved categories such as Scheduled\nCastes and Scheduled Tribes and backward classes. Thus the Rules make\ncomplete provisions regarding qualification and age for direct recruitment and G\nalso in respect of category of persons to whom relaxation can be granted\nwhich would be in accordance with the Government Orders. The Rules do not\nmention anywhere that while making direct recruitment any services rendered\nas an NMR employee has to be taken into consideration or some relaxation\nin age is to be granted on its basis. The writ petitioners had worked for a brief\nH\n6\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 6 S.C.R.\nA period as NMR employees in 1984-86. It was after a gap of more than six years\nthat they were appointed by way of direct recruitment on 17.8.1992. Under the\nRules they were clearly ineligible for being given any appointment as admittedly\nthey were over age.\n6. Learned Single Judge allowed the writ petition mainly on the ground\nB that on two earlier occasions the appellant had granted exemption from age\nand qualifications and no material was placed before the High Court as to why\nsuch a discretion could not be exercised by the appellant in favour of the\nconcerned employees, namely, the writ petitioners. The learned Single Judge\nhas also issued a writ of mandamus to the appellant to consider whether writ\npetitioner No. 5 was entitled for exemption from the requirement of age limit\nhaving regard to certain GOs issued by the Revenue Department of the State\nGovernments.\nC\n7. In our opinion the reasons given by the learned Single Judge for\nallowing the writ petition are wholly untenable in law. Merely because on two\nD earlier occasions the appellant granted exemption from eligibility criterion in\nrespect of some employees cannot be a ground to grant relief to the writ\npetitioners. Even if some concession had been shown to some employees in\nthe past it would not confer any right upon anyone seeking employment in\nfuture to claim exemption from eligibility criterion as a matter of right. In K.V.\nRajalakshmiah Setty and Anr. v. State of Mysore and Anr., AIR (1967) SC 993,\nit was held as under in paragraph 12 of the Report: -\nE\nF\nG\nH\n\"12. There is some force in some of the contentions put forward on\nbehalf of the State of Mysore. It is not necessary to test them as we\nfind ourselves unable to uphold the contention of the appellants. No\ndoubt some concession had been shown to the first batch of 41\npersons and the batches of persons who had come in after the batch\nof 73 persons also received some concession, but after all these were\nconcessions and not something which they could claim as of right.\nThe State of Mysore might have shown some indulgence to this batch\nof 63 persons but we cannot issue a writ of mandamus commanding\nit to do so. There was no service rule which the State had transgressed\nnor has the State evolved any principle to be followed in respect of\npersons who were promoted to the rank of Assistant Engineers from\nsurveyors. The indulgence shown to the different batches of persons\nwere really ad hoc and we are not in a position to say what, if any,\nad hoc indulgence should be meted out to the appellants before us.\"\nL\n:\nTIRUMALA TIRUPATI DEVASTHANAMS v. K. JOTHEESWARA PILLAI (D) BY LRS. [G.P. MATHUR, J.) 7\nTherefore, the view taken by the learned Single Judge that by not A\ngranting exemption from age criterion the appellant had indulged in invidious\ndiscrimination is clearly erroneous law.\n8. The learned Single Judge has also issued a writ of mandamus directing\nthe appellant to consider the case of writ petitioner No. 5 as to whether he\nwas entitled for exemption from age qualification. As already mentioned the B\nRules do not make any provision for granting exemption except to the limited\nextent as provided in the second para of Rule 11. The principles, on which\na writ of mandamus can be issued, are well settled and we will refer to only\none decision rendered in The Bihar Eastern Gangetic Fishermen Cooperative\nSociety Ltd. v. Sipahi Singh, AIR (1977) SC 2149, where this Court observed C\nas under: -\n\"A writ of mandamus can be granted only in a case where there is a\nstatutory duty imposed upon the officer concerned and there is a\nfailure on the part of that officer to discharge the statutory obligation.\nThe chief function of a writ is to compel performance of public duties Ꭰ\nprescribed by statute and to keep subordinate tribunals and officers\nexercising public functions within the limits of their jurisdiction. It\nfollows, therefore, that in order that mandamus may issue to compel\nthe authorities to do something, it must be shown that there is a\nstatute which imposes a legal duty and the aggrieved party has a legal\nright under the statute to enforce its performance.\"\nThere being no statutory provision or rule providing for exemption from\neligibility criterion, the learned Single Judge clearly erred in issuing a writ of\nmandamus against the appellant directing it to consider the case of writ\npetitioner No. 5 for granting him exemption from the rule providing for upper\nage limit for fresh appointment.\n9. In view of the discussion made above the impugned judgments of the\nHigh Court cannot be sustained and must be set aside. The appeal is accordingly\nallowed. The judgment and order dated 20.11.1997 passed by the learned\nSingle Judge and the judgment and order dated 21.1.2003 of the Division\nBench are set aside and the writ petition filed by the contesting respondents\nis dismissed.\n10. No order as to costs.\nE\nF\nG\nK.K.T.\nAppeal allowed.\nH\n"}
