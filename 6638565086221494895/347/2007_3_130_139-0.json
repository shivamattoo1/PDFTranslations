They had been put on guard duty in a hospital to keep a\nF watch on a 'convict', an eighty years old man. He was allegedly shackled to\nthe bed. At about 9 p.m. on the intervening night of 19th/20th May, 1984, the\nappellant-constables were found to be absent by the Inspector of Police. On\nenquiries, he came to know that all the three constables were absent from\nduty from 9 p.m. onwards. They were charge sheeted and a departmental\nG proceedings was initiated against them. The Enquiry Officer found them guilty.\nThe enquiry report was accepted by the Disciplinary Authority. The\nDisciplinary authority having found the cause shown by the delinquents to be\nunsatisfactory, passed orders of dismissal from service against them.\nAggrieved, all the three constables filed a suit, which was dismissed by the\nH\n130\n-1\nHARJIT SINGH v. STATE OF PUNJAB\n131\ntrial Court. Appeal filed against the order of trial Court was allowed by the A\nfirst appellate Court observing that absence from duty cannot be taken to be\nserious lapse which merits dismissal of the delinquents from service. A\nsecond appeal preferred by the State of Punjab as also the disciplinary\nAuthority was allowed by the High Court. Hence the present appeal.\nAppellants contended that from the impugned order passed by the B\nDisciplinary Authority, it appears that the authority had failed to consider\nthe implication as also the effect and purport of the provisions under Rule\n16.2 of the Punjab Police Rules.\nRespondent submitted that it was not necessary for the disciplinary\nauthority to specifically state in the order of dismissal of services that the\ndelinquents were guilty of gravest acts of misconduct.\nPartly allowing the appeal, the Court\nC\nD\nHELD: 1.1. A disciplinary proceeding was initiated against the\ndelinquents inter-alia on the premise that they were absent from duty from 9\np.m. till 2 a.m. on 19th/20th May, 1984. All the three constables were required\nto watch a convict. It is really a matter of surprise that the patient was shackled\nalthough he was 80 years old and a patient of tuberculosis. Why the human\nright of the prisoner was violated is not known. Absence from duty on the\npart of all the delinquent officers constitutes a grave misconduct particularly, E\nwhen the convict was placed on shackles as evidently they knew that he would\nnot be able to move from his bed. [Paras 9] [135-G-H]\n1.2. All the witnesses examined before the enquiry officer categorically\nstated that all the three delinquent officers had absented from duty together.\nTheir cross-examination was directed only towards the nature of guard duty F\nand the facilities and infrastructure available to those who were posted\ntherefor. The case of the State, however, all along been that the appellants\nhad not been put on guard duty. They never said that the delinquents were not\nabsent from duty. They were obligated to keep a watch over the convict,\nparticularly, when he was an aged patient suffering from tuberculosis. G\nHowever, despite the fact that the appellants might have committed a grave\nact of misconduct, the law requires the disciplinary authority to arrive at such\na finding. [Para 9] [135-H; 136-A-B]\n1.3. It is one thing to say that the disciplinary authority accepted the\nfinding of the enquiry officer, but, when a second show cause notice was issued H\n132\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 3 S.C.R.\nA as to why the appellants should not be dismissed, it was obligatory on the part\nof the disciplinary authority to arrive at such a positive finding that they have\ncommitted gravest acts of misconduct. The opinion formed by the disciplinary\nauthority is very relevant. Ordinarily a Civil Court would not interfere with\nthe findings of the disciplinary authority. First Appellate Court no doubt\nexceeded its jurisdiction in substituting its own opinion to that of the\ndisciplinary authority. [Para 11] [136-E, F, G]\nB\n1.4. Though, it is not necessary to repeat the wordings of the relevant\nprovisions of Law for the purpose of complying with the principles thereof in\nthe fact situation obtaining in a given case. But departmental proceeding is\nC quasi criminal in nature. The procedures laid down therefor wcre required\nto be complied with, embodying the principles of natural justice.

In the facts and circumstances of the case, ordinarily, the Disciplinary\nAuthority would have been asked to consider the matter afresh, but the\noccurrence has taken place in the year 1984. Appellants-constables had\nworked only for a few years, one of them is dead. In such a situation, it would\nF be justified to fix the quantum of punishment.

Sinha for the Respondents.\n133\nA\n1\nལཱ\nx\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nS.B. SINHA, J. 1. Leave granted.\nB\n2. Appellants were appointed as Constables in the Police Department\nof the State of Punjab. They had been put on a duty to keep a watch on\nBhagu Ram who was admitted in a hospital. He was allegedly shackled to the\nbed. At about 9 p.m. on the intervening night of 19th/20th May, 1984, the\nappellants alongwith one Parminder Singh (since deceased) were found to be\nabsent by the Inspector of Police. He made enquiries whereupon, he came to C\nknow that all the three constables were absent from duty from 9 p.m. onwards.\nOther constables from the police lines had to be requisitioned. They reported\nto Police Lines at about 3 a.m. on the same day. They were charge sheeted\nand a departmental proceedings was initiated against them. The Enquiry\nOfficer found them guilty. The enquiry report was accepted by the\nSuperintendent of Police, the Disciplinary Authority. A second Show Cause\nNotice was issued to which all the delinquent officers replied. By an Order\ndated 21.1.1985, the disciplinary authority, however, having found the cause\nshown by the delinquents to be unsatisfactory, passed orders of dismissal\nfrom service against them. Appellants and said Parminder Singh filed a suit.\nOne of the contentions raised in the said suit was that in passing the order E\nof punishment, the disciplinary authority had not complied with the provisions\nof Rule 16.2 of the Punjab Police Rules. It reads as under:-\nD\n“16.2 Dismissal - Dismissal shall be awarded only for the gravest acts\nof misconduct or as the cumulative effect of continued misconduct\nproving incorrigibility and complete unfitness for police service. In F\nmaking such an award regard shall be had to the length of service of\nthe offender and his claim to pension.\n(2) An enrolled police officer convicted and sentenced to imprisonment\non a criminal charge shall be dismissed :\n\"Provided that in case the conviction of a police officer is set\naside in appeal or revision, the officer empowered to appoint him\nshall review his case keeping in view the instructions issued by\nthe Government in this behalf.\"\nG\n3. Whereas the learned Trial Judge was of the opinion that the misconduct H\ncommitted by the delinquents was of grave nature, the first Appellate Court\n134\nA held:\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 3 S.C.R.\n\"....I find force in the contention of the learned counsel for the appellants\nbecause admittedly all the three constables, who are plaintiff-appellants\nbecause admittedly all the three constables, who are plaintiff-appellants\nbefore me were on duty in the T.B. Hospital, to escort and prisoner,\nwhere at least one person could have been present because as per\nRule 18.5 and 6 a constable can be on duty for three hours only and\nthe department had put three persons on duty and therefore, they\ncould not be present for 24 hours. So they had committed slight\ndelineation in duty. Thus we can say that one of them was atleast\nabsent, who was on duty at that time and it has been admitted that\nParminder Singh alias Bhola was on duty at that time when the\nabsence of the plaintiff-appellants was marked, but that absence cannot\nbe taken to be serious lapse which merits dismissal from service. It is\nwell settled that the punishment of dismissal is not proper in case of\nabsence from duty and I am supported on this point by a case State\nof Punjab v. Ahhar Singh, reported as (1991) 4 SLR 539 wherein it was\nheld as under:-\n\"Mere absence from duty for a few days does not amount to an\nact of gravest misconduct and the cumulative effort of which may\ngo to prove incorriginiety and complete unfitness of the employees\nfor police service and dismissal from service was held illegal.\"\nEven otherwise, I am of the considered view that if a person committed\nnegligence of being absent from duty that should not go to the root\nof his service because in that case it will be too harsh not only for\nhim, but for the children who are dependent on him.....\"\n4. A second appeal preferred by the State of Punjab as also the\nDisciplinary Authority was allowed by the High Court by reason of the\nimpugned judgment.\n5. The High Court in its judgment noticed some decisions of this Court\nG including Hombe Gowda Educational Trust v. State of Karnataka, [2006] 1\nSCC 430 where inter-alia it was held:-\nH\n\"This court has come a long way from its earlier view points. The\nrecent trend in the decisions of this court seek to strike a balance\nbetween the earlier approach to the industrial relation wherein only\nthe interest of the workmen was sought to be protected with the\n+\nx\n:\nHARJIT SINGH v. STATE OF PUNJAB [S.B. SINHA. J.]\n135\nT\n-1\navowed object of fast industrial growth of the country. In several A\ndecisions of this court it has been noticed how discipline at the\nworkplaces/industrial undertakings received a setback. In view of the\nchange in economic policy of the country, it may not now be proper\nto allow the employees to break the discipline with impunity. Our\ncountry is governed by rule of law. All actions, therefore must be\nB\ntaken in accordance with law.\"\n6. Hombe Gowda (supra) has been noticed by this Court in large\nnumber of cases including the following:-\nL.K. Verma v. HMT Ltd., [2006] 2 SCC 269, State of U.P. v. Sheo Shankar\nLal Srivastava, [2006] 3 SCC 276, Maharashtra State Seeds Corp. Ltd. v.\nHariprasad Srupadrai Jadhao, [2006] 3 SCC 690, A. Sudhakar v. Postmaster\nGeneral, [2006] 4 SCC 348, Anand Regional Coop. Oil Seedgrowers' Union\nLtd. v. Shaileshkumar Harshadbhai Shah, [2006] 6 SCC 548, North-Eastern\nKarnataka RTC v. Ashappa, [2006] 5 SCC 137].\n7. Mr. Jawaharlal Gupta, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of\nappellants took us through the impugned order passed by the Disciplinary\nAuthority and submitted that from a perusal thereof, it would appear that it\nhad failed to consider the implication as also the effect and purport of the\nprovisions of Rule 16.2 of the Punjab Police Rules.\n8. Mr. Swarup Singh, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the\nrespondent, on the other hand, submitted that it was not necessary for the\ndisciplinary authority to specifically state in the order of dismissal of services\nthat the delinquents were guilty of gravest acts of misconduct. Strong reliance\nin this behalf has been placed in State of Punjab \u0026 Ors. v. Sukhwinder Singh,\n[1999] SCC (L\u0026S) 1234].\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\n9. A disciplinary proceeding was initiated against the appellants herein\nas also against the said Parminder Singh inter-alia on the premise that they\nwere absent from duty from 9 p.m. till 2 a.m. on 19th/20th May, 1984. All the\nthree constables were required to watch a convict named 'Bhagu'. It is really\na matter of surprise that the patient was shackled although he was 80 years\nold and a patient of tuberculosis. Why the human right of the prisoner was\nviolated is not known. Absence from duty on the part of all the delinquent\nofficers constitutes a grave misconduct particularly, when the convict was\nplaced on shackles as evidently they knew that he would not be able to move\nfrom his bed. It furthermore appears that all the witnesses examined before H\n136\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 3 S.C.R.\nA the enquiry officer categorically stated that all the three delinquent officers *.\nhad absented from duty together. Their cross-examination was directed only\ntowards the nature of guard duty and the facilities and infrastructure available\nto those who were posted therefor. The case of the State, however, all along\nbeen the appellants had not been put on guard duty. They never said that\nthey were not absent from duty. They were obligated to keep a watch over\nthe convict, particularly, when he was an aged patient suffering from\ntuberculosis. However, despite the fact that the appellants might have committed\na grave act of misconduct, the law requires the disciplinary authority to arrive\nat such a finding. The disciplinary authority held:-\nB\nC\nᎠ\nE\nF\n\"....They were also asked to report in my office and submit their\nexplanation. The accused constables submitted their replies which is\non record. These accused constables for keeping a strict vigil and\nwatch on the prisoners which is a very important duty. But the said\naccused constables left the prisoners all alone in the night and remained\nabsent from their duties in the Hospital. Such an absence of important\nduty by the accused constables is a very big mistake.....'\n\"\n10. The decision of this Court in Sukhwinder Singh (supra) is an\nauthority for the proposition that it is not necessary to use the words\n\"gravest act of misconduct\" as it can be found out from the factual matrix\nobtaining in each case.\n11. It is one thing to say that the disciplinary authority accepted the\nfinding of the enquiry officer, but, when a second show cause notice was\nissued as to why the appellants and the said Parminder Singh should not be\ndismissed, it was obligatory on the part of the disciplinary authority to arrive\nat such a positive finding that the respondents have committed gravest acts\nof misconduct. The opinion formed by a disciplinary authority is very relevant.\nOrdinarily a Civil Court would not interfere with the findings of the disciplinary\nauthority. The jurisdiction of the Civil Court is limited. The Civil Court in a\nsuit would not ordinarily interfere with the findings of fact; its jurisdiction\ninter-alia being to find out as to whether the statutory rules respecting the\nG disciplinary enquiry were complied with or the principles of natural justice\nhave been followed or not. The First Appellate Court no doubt exceeded its\njurisdiction in substituting its own opinion to that of the disciplinary authority.\n12. We are not oblivious of the fact, that it is not necessary to repeat\nthe wordings of the Section for the purpose of complying with the principles\nH thereof in the fact situation obtaining in a given case. But departmental\n7\n137\nHARJIT SINGH v. STATE OF PUNJAB [S.B. SINHA. J.]\nproceeding is quasi criminal in nature. The procedures laid down therefor A\nwere required to be complied with, embodying the principles of natural justice.\n13. Justice Frankfurter in Vitarelli v. Seaton, [359 US 535] stated.\n\"An executive agency must be rigorously held to the standards by\nwhich it professes its action to be judged...... Accordingly, if dismissal B\nfrom employment is based on a defined procedure, even though\ngenerous beyond the requirements that bind such agency, that\nprocedure must be scrupulously observed. .....This judicially evolved\nrule of administrative law is now firmly established and, if I may add,\nrightly so. He that takes the procedural sword shall perish with the\nsword.\"\n(See Ramana Dayaram Shetty v. The International Airport Authority\nof India and Ors., AIR (1979) SC 1628)\nC\n14. It is also true as was submitted by Mr. Swarup Singh that in case\nD\nof habitual absence, a punishment of dismissal of service would be just. [See\nState of Punjab \u0026 Ors. v. Sukhwinder Singh, [1999] SCC (L\u0026S) 1234 and\nMaan Singh v. Union of India \u0026 Ors., [2003] 3 SCC 464]. We are furthermore\nnot oblivious of a decision of this Court in State of Punjab v. Ram Singh Ex-\nConstable, [1992] 4 SCC 54 wherein interpreting Rule 16.2, this Court stated\nthe law in the following terms:-\nE\n\"7. Rule 16.2(1) consists of two parts. The first part is referable to\ngravest acts of misconduct which entails awarding an order of\ndismissal. Undoubtedly there is distinction between gravest misconduct\nand grave misconduct. Before awarding an order of dismissal it shall\nbe mandatory that dismissal order should be made only when there F\nare gravest acts of misconduct, since it impinges upon the pensionary\nrights of the delinquent after putting long length of service. As stated\nthe first part relates to gravest acts of misconduct. Under General\nClauses Act singular includes plural, \"act\" includes acts. The\ncontention that there must be plurality of acts of misconduct to award\ndismissal is fastidious. The word \"acts\" would include singular \"act\"\nas well. It is not the repetition of the acts complained of but its quality,\ninsidious effect and gravity of situation that ensues from the offending\n\"act\". The colour of the gravest act must be gathered from the\nsurrounding or attending circumstances. Take for instance the\ndelinquent who put in 29 years of continuous length of service and H\nG\n138\nA\nB\nс\nᎠ\nE\nF\nG\nH\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 3 S.C.R.\nhad unblemished record; in thirtieth year he commits defalcation of\npublic money or fabricates false records to conceal misappropriation.\nHe only committed once. Does it men that he should not be inflicted\nwith the punishment of dismissal but be allowed to continue in service\nfor that year to enable him to get his full pension. The answer is\nobviously no. Therefore, a single act of corruption is sufficient to\naward an order of dismissal under the rule as gravest act of misconduct.\n8. The second part of the rule connotes the cumulative effect of\ncontinued misconduct proving incorrigibility and complete unfitness\nfor police service and that the length of service of the offender and\nhis claim for pension should be taken into account in an appropriate\ncase. The contention that both parts must be read together appears\nto us to be illogical. Second part is referable to a misconduct minor\nin character which does not by itself warrant an order of dismissal but\ndue to continued acts of misconduct would have insidious cumulative\neffect on service morale and may be a ground to take lenient view of\ngiving an opportunity to reform. Despite giving such opportunities if\nthe delinquent officer proved to be incorrigible and found completely\nunfit to remain in service then to maintain discipline in the service,\ninstead of dismissing the delinquent officer, a lesser punishment of\ncompulsory retirement or demotion to a lower grade or rank or removal\nfrom service without affecting his future chances of re-employment,\nif any, may meet the ends of justice. Take for instance the delinquent\nofficer who is habitually absent from duty when required. Despite\ngiving an opportunity to reform himself he continues to remain absent\nfrom duty off and on. He proved himself to be incorrigible and thereby\nunfit to continue in service. Therefore, taking into account his long\nlength of service and his claim for pension he may be compulsorily\nretired from service so as to enable him to earn proportionate pension.\nThe second part of the rule operates in that area. It may also be made\nclear that the very order of dismissal from service for gravest\nmisconduct may entail forfeiture of all pensionary benefits. Therefore,\nthe word 'or' cannot be read as \"and\". It must be disjunctive and\nindependent. The common link that connects both clauses is \"the\ngravest act/acts of misconduct.”\n15. In the aforementioned situation, ordinarily, we would have asked the\nDisciplinary Authority to consider the matter afresh, but the occurrence has\ntaken place in the year 1984. Appellants and the said Parminder Singh had\n+\n虫\ni\nHARJIT SINGH v. STATE OF PUNJAB [S.B. SINHA, J.]\n139\nworked only for a few years, one of them is dead. In the aforementioned A\nsituation, we are of the opinion that we would be justified to fix the quantum\nof punishment. We are of the opinion that in the facts and circumstances of\nthis case and in particular having regard to the passage of time, punishment\nof compulsory Retirement will meet the ends of justice. If otherwise eligible,\nthe delinquents would be entitled to retiral benefits. The appeal is allowed to\nB\nthe aforementioned extent.\n16. In the facts and circumstances of the case, there shall be no order\nas to costs.\nS.K.S.\nAppeal partly allowed.\nC\n"}
