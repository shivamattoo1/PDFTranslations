PW-17 lodged FIR specifically naming the accused and\nalso categorically stating about the specific role played by each accused.\nAppellant-accused was absconding. Hence, his case was separated from that\nof the other accused. In the fact trial (relating to other accused) two witnesses\nturned hostile. In the second trial (relating to the appellant-accused) apart\nfrom the two hostile witnesses two more witnesses turned hostile. Evidence\nof the first informant was consistent in both the trials. Trial Court as well as\nHigh Court convicted the accused u/s 302 IPC. Hence the present appeal.\nF\nG\nH\nDismissing the appeal, the Court\nHELD: 1.1. The Trial Judge as also the High Court relied upon the\ntestimonies of the first informant (PW-17). There is no reason to differ\ntherewith. He not only named the appellant in the First Informantion Report\nbut also in his deposition categorically stated about the role played by each of\nthe accused person.

Sufficient materials have been brought on records to establish that A\nthe appellant participated in commission of the offence. All the accused\npersons came together in a tempo. They were armed with various weapons.\nThey assaulted the deceased. Courts below found existence of a motive for\ncommission of the offence. They left the place of occurrence together. It may\nbe that the ultimate cause of death was found to be an assault by stone on the\nB\nhead of the deceased which is said to be the act of a co-accused, but only by\nreason thereof existence of the common intention on the part of the appellant\ncannot be said to be absent. The appellant shared common intention with the\nother accused in committing the crime. [Paras 15 and 19] [855-E; 857-C-D]\nVatjayanti v.

Crl. Appeal No. 1211 of\n2002.\nJitendra Singh Tanwar and Mohan Pandey for the Appellant.\nMadhurima Tatia and Aruneshwar Gupta for the Respondent.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nC\nS.B. SINHA, J. 1. Leave granted.\n2. Appellant together with various others were tried for commission of\nan offence under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code for causing murder of\none Vishava Priya @ Lalla on 13.12.1992. A First Information Report in relation\nto the said incident was lodged by one Ashok Kumar Sharma. The incident\nD allegedly took place at about 6 p.m. on the said date. In the First Information\nReport, the complainant alleged that at the said date and time when he himself\nand his uncle Mahendra Kumar had been getting the Pattis loaded near the\nroad, a tempo (a three wheeler) occupied by one Ajij Naeem, Bhupendra and\nthe appellant arrived. The accused were armed with weapons like lathi, dhariya,\nballam and sariya. As there existed a dispute between the deceased and\nBhupendra, apprehending that they may kill him, the complainant and the said\nMahendra Kumar immediately came to the place of occurrence and found the\nappellant and others assaulting the deceased. They, on seeing them, ran\naway. A First Information Report was lodged at about 9.10 p.m. on the same\nday. Appellant was named therein along with others, wherein it was alleged\nF that he was armed with a gandasi and he along with others assaulted the\nE\ndeceased. It was furthermore alleged that Bhupendra had thrown a stone on\nthe deceased, due to which he suffered a wound on his head. Investigation\ninto commission of the offence was carried out. Upon completion of the\ninvestigation, a chargesheet was filed against the appellant as also the said\nAjij, Naeem and Bhupendra. Appellant had been absconding for about seven\nG\nyears. His case was separated from that of the other accused. Two separate\ntrials, thus, took place in relation to the said incident.\n3. In the first trial involving the accused named in the First Information\nReport, other than the appellant, several witnesses were examined. Two of\nH them, viz., Ram Het (PW-8) and Ghasi Lal (PW-9) fully supported the\nJODHRAJ SINGH v. STATE OF RAJASTHAN [S.B. SINHA, J.] 853\nprosecution case. One Pratap Yadav (PW-10) and Alok Tripathi (PW-14), A\nhowever, were declared hostile therein. In the second trial, where the appellant\nwas involved, they also turned hostile. Appellant was, however, convicted.\nFour separate appeals were preferred before the High Court.\n4. The learned Sessions Judge as also the High Court, however, relied\non the testimonies of the said witnesses as they, when confronted with their B\nearlier statements, accepted that they had deposed against the appellant.\nAccording to them, they did so on having been asked to do so by some\nvillagers. The learned Sessions Judge as also the High Court did not rely\nupon that part of the testimonies of the said witnesses. The High Court,\ntherefore, by reason of the impugned judgment upheld the conviction and C\nsentence of the appellant.\n5. Mr. Mohan Pandey, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the\nappellant, at the very outset drew our attention to the fact that the deceased\nwas a known criminal and a large number of cases were pending against him\nand as such the possibility of his being killed by some unknown persons D\ncannot be ruled out. It was submitted that as four prosecution witnesses had\nturned hostile, the impugned judgment cannot be sustained.\n6. The first informant Ashok Kumar Sharma examined himself as PW-\n17. He, as noticed hereinbefore, not only named the appellant in the First\nInformation Report but also in his deposition, he categorically stated about E\nthe role played by each of the accused persons. He stated that the appellant\ntook part in the entire assault and furthermore inflicted a gandasi blow on the\nhead of the deceased. He knew all the accused persons including the appellant\nfrom his childhood.\n7. Both the learned Trial Judge as also the High Court relied upon the\ntestimonies of the said witness. We see no reason to differ therewith.\n8. Dr. Rakesh Kumar Sharma (PW-13) conducted the post mortem on the\ndead body of the deceased at about 9.45 a.m. on 14.12.1992. He found the\nfollowing ante-mortem injuries on the person of the deceased:\n\"1. Abrasion ½ x ½ on left shoulder posteriorily.\n2. Lacerated wound 1\" x 1/2\" x B.D. vertical on left side of chin.\n3. Lacerated would 1” x ½” x 1\" on left angle of mouth.\nF\nG\nH\n854\nA\nB\nC\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 5 S.C.R.\n4. Lacerated wound 3” x 1\" x 2\" on fore head left side.\nBone broken in pieces, brain matter, badly lacerated eye ball pushed\ninside.\n5. Abrasion 1\" x ½\" vertical on left cheek.\n\"\n6. Lacerated wound 1\" x ½” x ½\" on left frontal parietal scalp.\n7. Incised wound 4\" x 2\" x 2\" transverse tempo parietal region left\nside, and\n8. Bruise 1\" x 1\" on nose.\"\n9. Ram Het (PW-2 in the first trial and PW-8 in the second) spoke in\ndetails about the participation of the accused persons including the appellant\nherein. So did the other eye-witness Ghasi Lal (PW-9).\n10. In both the trials, common witnesses were examined. At the cost of\nD repetition, we may state that the first informant had supported the prosecution\ncase in its entirety in both the trials. He has been believed.\n11. The High Court took up all the appeals together for hearing. The\nonly distinctive fact in the case involving the appellant was PWs 8 and 9\nturned hostile, but the same, in our opinion, would not materially alter the\nE prosecution case, as a conviction can even be based on the testimony of a\nsingle witness. The courts furthermore are entitled to rely upon a part of the\ntestimony of a witness who has been permitted to be cross-examined by the\nprosecution.\nF\nG\nH\n12. In State of U.P. v. Ramesh Prasad Misra and Anr., [1996] 10 SCC\n360, this Court opined:\n\"7. The question is whether the first respondent was present at the\ntime of death or was away in the village of DW 1, his brother-in-law.\nIt is rather most unfortunate that these witnesses, one of whom was\nan advocate, having given the statements about the facts within their\nspecial knowledge, under Section 161 recorded during investigation,\nhave resiled from correctness of the versions in the statements. They\nhave not given any reason as to why the investigating officer could\nrecord statements contrary to what they had disclosed. It is equally\nsettled law that the evidence of a hostile witness would not be totally\nrejected if spoken in favour of the prosecution or the accused, but it\nJODHRAJ SINGH v. STATE OF RAJASTHAN [S.B. SINHA, J.] 855\ncan be subjected to close scrutiny and that portion of the evidence A\nwhich is consistent with the case of the prosecution or defence may\nbe accepted...\"\n[See also Gurpreet Singh v. State of Haryana, [2002] 8 SCC 18 and\nGagan Kanojia \u0026 Anr. v. State of Punjab, (2006) 12 SCALE 479]\n13. Moreover, while recording a judgment of conviction, the court may\nconsider a part of the deposition of a witness who had been permitted to be\ncross-examined by prosecution having regard to the fact situation obtaining\nin the said case. How the evidence adduced before it shall be appreciated by\nthe court would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case.\nB\nC\n14. It is trite that only because a witness, for one reason or the other,\nhas, to some extent, resiled from his earlier statement by itself may not be\nsufficient to discard the prosecution case in its entirety. The courts even in\nsuch situation are not powerless. Keeping in view the materials available\non record, it is permissible for a court of law to rely upon a part of the\nD\ntestimony of the witness who has been declared hostile.\n15. Appellant was seen in the company of the other accused. Sufficient\nmaterials have been brought on records to establish that he participated in\ncommission of the offence. All the accused persons came together in a tempo.\nThey were armed with various weapons. They assaulted the deceased. The E\nlearned Sessions Judge as also the High Court found existence of a motive\nfor commission of the offence. They left the place of occurrence together. It\nmay be that the ultimate cause of death was found to be an assault by stone\non the head of the deceased which is said to be the act of Bhupendra but\nonly by reason thereof existence of the common intention on the part of the\nappellant cannot be said to be absent.\n16. Reliance by the learned counsel for the appellant on Mithu Singh\nv. State of Punjab, [2001] 4 SCC 193 is misplaced. Therein, no overt act was\nattributed to the appellant therein. The court found that no evidence was\nbrought on records as against him, save and except ipse dixit on the part of\nthe witnesses. This Court, in the aforementioned fact situation, opined:\n\"6. To substantiate a charge under Section 302 with the aid of Section\n34 it must be shown that the criminal act complained against was done\nby one of the accused persons in furtherance of the common intention\nof both. Common intention has to be distinguished from same or\nF\nG\nH\n856\nA\nB\nC\nᎠ\nE\nF\nG\nH\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 5 S.C.R.\nsimilar intention. It is true that it is difficult, if not impossible, to\ncollect and produce direct evidence in proof of the intention of the\naccused and mostly an inference as to intention shall have to be\ndrawn from the acts or conduct of the accused or other relevant\ncircumstances, as available. An inference as to common intention\nshall not be readily drawn; the culpable liability can arise only if such\ninference can be drawn with a certain degree of assurance. At the\nworst Mithu Singh, accused-appellant, knew that his co-accused\nBharpur Singh was armed with a pistol. The knowledge of previous\nenmity existing between Bharpur Singh and the deceased can also be\nattributed to Mithu Singh. But there is nothing available on record to\ndraw an inference that the co-accused Bharpur Singh had gone to the\nhouse of the deceased with the intention of causing her death and\nsuch intention was known to Mithu Singh, much less shared by him.\nSimply because Mithu Singh was himself armed with a pistol would\nnot necessarily lead to an inference that he had also reached the\nhouse of the deceased or had accompanied the co-accused Bharpur\nSingh with the intention of causing the death of Gurdial Kaur. In our\nopinion, an inference as to Mithu Singh, accused-appellant having\nshared with Bharpur Singh a common intention of causing the murder\nof the deceased Gurdial Kaur cannot be drawn. His conviction under\nSections 302/34 IPC cannot be sustained and must be set aside.\"\nSuch is not the position here.\n17. In Vaijayanti v. State of Maharashtra, [2005] 13 SCC 134, as regards\nformation of common intention, this Court opined:\n“Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code envisages that “when a criminal\nact is done by several persons in furtherance of the common intention\nof all, each of such persons, is liable for that act, in the same manner\nas if it were done by him alone\". The underlying principle behind the\nsaid provision is joint liability of persons in doing of a criminal act\nwhich must have found in the existence of common intention of\nenmity in the acts in committing the criminal act in furtherance thereof.\nThe law in this behalf is no longer res integra. There need not be a\npositive overt act on the part of the person concerned. Even an\nomission on his part to do something may attract the said provision.\nBut it is beyond any cavil of doubt that the question must be answered\nhaving regard to the fact situation obtaining in each case.\"\n!\nJODHRAJ SINGH v. STATE OF RAJASTHAN [S.B. SINHA, J.] 857\n[See also Triloki Nath and Ors. v. State of U.P., [2005] 13 SCC 323] A\n18. In Pardeep Kumar v. Union Administration, Chandigarh, [2006] 10\nSCC 608, this Court opined:\n\"12. It is settled law that the common intention or the intention of the\nindividual concerned in furtherance of the common intention could be B\nproved either from direct evidence or by inference from the acts or\nattending circumstances of the case and conduct of the parties. Direct\nproof of common intention is seldom available and, therefore, such\nintention can only be inferred from the circumstances appearing from\nthe proved facts of the case and the proved circumstances.\"\n19. We are, having regard to the materials brought on record by the\nprosecution, satisfied that the appellant shared common intention with the\nother accused in committing the crime.\n20. We, therefore, do not find any infirmity in judgments of the learned\nSessions Judge and the High Court. The appeal is dismissed accordingly.\nC\nD\nK.K.T.\nAppeal dismissed.\n"}
