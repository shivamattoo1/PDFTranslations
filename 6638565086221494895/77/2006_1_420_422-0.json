After the High\nCourt had permitted the Commission to take necessary decision, the\nCommission, in fact, took decision and fixed the tariff for the relevant\nperiods; and levy is being made accordingly. Correctness of the tariff fixed\ncan be questioned before the prescribed forum, as provided in the Orissa\nElectricity Reforms Act, 1994. That being so, there was no necessity for\nthe High Court to keep the writ petitions pending. Nothing further needs\nto be done in these appeals except directing the High Court to treat the\nwrit petitions as having become infructuous. [421-F-H; 422-A|\n2006.\nCIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal Nos. 519-524 of\nFrom the Judgment and Orders dated 3.2.2003 of the Orissa High Court\n420\nORISSA ELECTRICITY REGULATORY COMMISSION v. L.I. PARIJA [PASAYAT, J.] 421\nin Misc. Case Nos. 7410 and 8953 of 2002, dated 7.3.2003 in Misc. Case No. A\n414 of 2003 and dated 14.3.2003 in O.J.C. No. 6751 of 2001 and Misc. Case\nNos. 414 and 580 of 2003.\nMr. Raj Kumar Mehta for the Appellants.\nB\nJanaranjan Das, Swetaketu Mishra, R.K. Talwar, Amit Talwar, Yash\nPal Dhingra and Ms. N. Annapoorani for the Respondents.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nARIJIT PASAYAT, J. Heard learned counsel for the parties.\nC\nLeave granted.\nThe appeals were essentially directed against the interim orders passed\nby the Orissa High Court directing, in offence, restraining the Orissa Electricity\nRegulatory Commission (in short ‘the Commission') - appellant herein from\ntaking steps in the matter of fixation of tariff for the periods 2002-03 and\n2003-04. During the course of hearing, learned counsel for the appellant\nplaced before us an order dated 02.09.2003 in Misc. Case Nos. 1380 and\n1805 of 2003 by which the earlier orders were modified and the Commission\nwas permitted to decide on the question of fixation of tariff for the aforesaid\ntwo periods. The writ petitioners before the High Court, who are respondent\nNos. 2 to 13 in these appeals have not appeared inspite of service of notice.\nFrom the order dated 02.09.2003, it is clear that the High Court virtually\nrecalled the order of restraint on the exercise of power of the Commission.\nBut at the same time, the High Court has kept the matters pending for the\npurpose of monitoring the action of the Commission. We find these orders\nto be rather strange. The interim orders passed by the High Court restraining\nthe Commission from exercising its functions are indefensible. After the\nHigh Court had permitted the Commission to take necessary decision, the\nCommission has, in fact, taken decision and has fixed the tariff for the two\nD\nE\nF\nperiods. It is also not disputed that levy is being made on the basis of tariff G\nso fixed. It is not in dispute that correctness of the tariff fixed can be questioned\nbefore the prescribed forum, as provided in the Orissa Electricity Reform,\nAct, 1994. That being so, there was no necessity for the High Court to keep\nthe writ petitions pending. As the Commission has already taken decisions,\nthe tariffs have been fixed and levys are being made, nothing further needs H\n422\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2006] 1 S.C.R.\nA to be done in these appeals except directing the High Court to treat the Writ\nPetition as having become infructuous. The appeals are accordingly disposed\nof. In view of this order, the notice of contempt issued by the High Court and\nthe contempt proceedings stand quashed.\nR.P.\nAppeals allowed.\n"}
