It is in the backdrop of these provisions generally that\nit has to be seen as to whether the interpretation put forward\nby the Full Bench in two separate but concurrent judgments, is\ncorrect or not. Though the question referred to the Full Bench\nwas restricted to the correctness of the interpretation of the term\n'unprotected worker' in Section 2(11) of the Mathadi Act as\ngiven in the case of Century Textiles \u0026 Industries Ltd. vs. State\nof Maharashtra (cited supra), in our opinion, the scope of the\nquestion has to be properly understood. In that case, it was held\nby the Division Bench of that Court that the workers who were\nworking in the factory of the petitioner could not be termed as\nD\nE\nF\nG\n1\nH\nB\n644 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2009] 16 (ADDL.) S.C.R.\nA 'unprotected workers'. It was held specifically that the Mathadi\nAct did not deal with the employees engaged on monthly basis,\nas such workers were protected under the Shops and\nEstablishments Act and other enactments. It was further held\nthat it was only the casually engaged workmen, who would\ncome within the purview of the Mathadi Act. The High Court\nfurther said that where the material produced on record clearly\nshow that the workmen are protected workmen, more\nparticularly, with reference to the Agreement under Section 2(p)\nof the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, the Act in question would\nC not apply. Therefore, the referred question was whether it was\nonly casually engaged workers, who came within the purview\nof the Act. The majority judgment gave a straight answer to this\nquestion that the meaning of the term 'unprotected worker' was\nonly the casual workman, was not correct, while the Learned\nSingle Judge did not stop at that and gave a broader answer\ninterpreting Section 2(11) of the Mathadi Act and held that every\nmanual worker engaged or to be engaged in any scheduled\nemployment, irrespective of whether he is protected by other\nlabour legislations or not, would be termed as 'unprotected\nworker', and further that the definition was not restricted to those\nmanual workers who are casually engaged. Though the\njudgment of the Learned Single Judge was criticized by Shri\nJ.P. Cama, Learned Senior Counsel for the appellants that it\nwent beyond the reference made, we feel that the Learned\nSingle Judge has not travelled beyond the reference. The\nreference has to be read as requiring the correct interpretation\nof Section 2(11) of the Mathadi Act and the term 'unprotected\nworker' and, therefore, in our opinion, it would have to be\nexplained as to what is the true scope and meaning of the term\n'unprotected worker' as envisaged by Section 2(11) of the\nG Mathadi Act. In that, the debate cannot be restricted to the\nD\nE\nய\nF\nH\nnarrower question as to whether the term means only the\ncasually engaged workers. In our opinion, the true impact of the\nterm 'unprotected worker' has to be considered and it will have\nalso to be pointed out as to who can be said to be ‘unprotected\nBHUWALKA STEEL INDUS. LTD. v. BOMBAY IRON \u0026 645\nSTEEL LABOUR BD. \u0026 ANR. [V.S. SIRPURKAR, J.]\nworker'. The objection in that behalf raised by the appellant to A\nthe Full Bench judgment is not correct. When we see the\njudgment in Kay Kay Embroideries Pvt. Ltd. vs. Cloth Market\nand Shops Board, Mumbai \u0026 Ors. [2006 III LLJ 824 Bom], it\nis clear that the Court had posed two questions:-\n(i)\nWhether the expression 'unprotected worker'\nmeans a worker not protected by labour legislation\nor whether the expression means a manual worker\nwho is engaged or to be engaged in any scheduled\nemployment as defined in Section 2(11) of the\nMathadi Act?\n(ii) Whether a Mathadi worker, who has been engaged\ndirectly by an employer, would fall outside the\npurview of the Mathadi Act?\nThe Division Bench in this case did not agree with the\njudgment in the case of Century Textiles \u0026 Industries Ltd. vs.\nState of Maharashtra (cited supra). The referring judgment\nclearly goes on to show that it did not agree with the narrower\njudgment in the case of Century Textiles \u0026 Industries Ltd. vs.\nState of Maharashtra (cited supra), but it cannot be forgotten\nthat the two questions framed by it clearly show that the\nconsideration could not be restricted to the narrower question\nas to whether the view taken in the case of Century Textiles \u0026\nIndustries Ltd. vs. State of Maharashtra (cited supra) was\ncorrect or not, instead the question which arose for\nconsideration on account of the two Benches not agreeing was\nas to what was the true scope of the definition of the expression\n'unprotected worker' in Section 2(11) of the Mathadi Act.\nConsidering the clear language and the questions considered\nin the referring judgment by Hon'ble F.K. Rebello and Dr. D.Y.\nChandrachud, JJ., we feel that the Learned Single Judge did\nnot exceed the question referred in considering the full scope\nof the Section 2(11) of the Mathadi Act and the term\n'unprotected worker'. We will, therefore, proceed on the basis\nthat the Full Bench had to decide the true scope of the term\nB\nс\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n1\n646 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2009] 16 (ADDL.) S.C.R.\nA 'unprotected worker' as defined in Section 2(11) of the Mathadi\nAct and to point out as to who could be covered under that\ndefinition.\nB\nC\nD\n☐ E\n☐ F\n☐ G\nH\n11. Basically, the contentions raised by the parties are as\nfollows:\nLegal Submissions on behalf of the Appellants\nA.\nB.\nSection 2(11) of the Mathadi Act cannot be\ninterpreted independently of Section 2(12) of the\nMathadi Act, which is the definition of 'worker' and\nconjoined reading of these two Sections in the light\nof other provisions of the Act would clearly bring out\nthat those workers who are regularly employed and\nwho have the protection of other labour legislations,\ncannot be termed as 'unprotected workers'. For\nthat purpose, the two Sections cannot be\ninterpreted merely on the basis of plain meaning of\nthe language of the Sections, instead the\ninterpretation has to be done taking into\nconsideration the context of the Mathadi Act, the\nStatement of Objects and Reasons and legislative\nhistory of the Act. Shri J.P. Cama, Learned Senior\nCounsel for the appellants further contended that\nthe Full Bench had erred in interpreting the said\ndefinition in isolation and not in the context of the\nAct. According to the Learned Senior Counsel, the\nMathadi Act was intended to cover only itinerant\nworkers doing manual works for short time periods.\nThe Learned Senior Counsel further argued that if\nthe literal interpretation is accepted, as has been\ndone by the Full Bench, number of other provisions\nin the Act like Section 15(2)(b) would be rendered\notiose and redundant, so also other anomalies\nwould creep in. The Learned Senior Counsel also\nurged that the Full Bench had erred in ignoring the\ni\nBHUWALKA STEEL INDUS. LTD. v. BOMBAY IRON \u0026 647\nSTEEL LABOUR BD. \u0026 ANR. [V.S. SIRPURKAR, J.]\nC.\nC\ndoctrine of stare decisis, inasmuch as the provision A\nhad received consistent interpretation for a\nconsiderable period and hence, that interpretation\nwas liable to be respected, particularly because the\nrights and obligations of the parties covered by this\nAct had remained settled for a long period of time. B\nTherefore, even if the earlier interpretation might not\nbe strictly correct or where two views were possible,\nthe settled principle of law could not be unsettled.\nThe Learned Senior Counsel contended that the law\nwas settled by two judgments of the Bombay High\nCourt by Hon'ble Rege, J. in C. Jairam Pvt. Ltd. vs.\nState of Maharashtra [Misc. Petition No. 150 of\n1973] pronounced on 19.4.1974 and S.B. More \u0026\nOrs. vs. State of Maharashtra \u0026 Ors. [Misc. Petition\nNo. 414 of 1973] pronounced on 24.4.1974 and\nfour other Division Bench Judgments in Lallubhai\nKevaldas \u0026 Anr. vs. The State of Maharashtra \u0026\nOrs. [Writ Petition No. 119 of 1979] pronounced on\n16.1.1980, Irkar Sahu's \u0026 Anr. vs. Bombay Port\nTrust [1994 | CLR 187], Century Textiles \u0026\nIndustries Ltd. vs. State of Maharashtra (cited\nsupra) including this Court judgment in Maharashtra\nRajya Mathadi Transport and Central Kamgar\nUnion vs. State of Maharashtra \u0026 Ors. [1995 Supp.\n3 SCC 28].\nD\nE\nF\nThe Learned Senior Counsel further relied on the\nRule of Contemporanea Expositio Est Optima Et\nFortissima In Lege. According to the Learned\nSenior Counsel, the Full Bench should have\nconsidered how the authorities themselves G\nconstrued and understood the law. In that behalf, the\nruling in Godawat Pan Masala Products I.P. Ltd. \u0026\nAnr. vs. Union of India \u0026 Ors. [2004(7) SCC 68]\nwas relied upon heavily. Reference was made by\nthe Learned Senior Counsel to few letters to show\nH\n"}
