[Para 7] [190-C, Dá»Š\nCIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 1054 of 2005.\nFrom the final Judgment and Order dated 23.5.2002 of the High Court\nof Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh in C.W.P. No. 8199/1994.\n187\nF\nG\nH\nA\nA\nB\nC\n188\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 1 S.C.R.\nDevendra Kumar Singh, Binay Kumar Jha and Mali Ram Bidsar Advs.\nfor the Appellants.\nAnnam D.N. Rao, Mrs. Rachana Joshi Issar and Sudhir Nandrajog\nAdvs. for the Respondents.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nDr. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. : Challenge in this appeal is to the order\npassed by a Division Bench of the Punjab and Haryana High Court\ndismissing the Writ Petition filed by the appellants.\n2. Background facts in a nutshell are as follows:\nThe Writ Petition was filed in the year 1994, taking the stand that\nindustries by non official residents were operating in residential areas and,\ntherefore, they were liable to be closed. This stand was resisted by the\nD respondents on the ground that the factories in question were situated in\nE\nF\nG\nH\nSector 16 which in terms of the Old Master Plan was an industrial area.\nTherefore, the grievances of the writ petitioners were without substance.\nThe High Court asked for report of the Punjab Pollution Control Board (in\nshort the 'Board'). The Board's report which is re-produced in the order of\nthe High Court reads as follows:\n\"Lastly the action taken report was filed on 8.4.2002 by the Board\nshowing that 61 units have complied with the provisions of the Air\n(Prevention \u0026 Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. Out of remaining 27\nunits, 16 units have been closed down by the Board under Section\n21/31-A of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981.\n8 Units have closed down their units themselves. Remaining 3\nnumber units have not installed Air Pollution control devices.\nThereafter 2 more units have installed Air Pollution Control Devices\nand 1 unit has changed its fuel from furnace oil to Liquid Petroleum\nGas (LPG) in which Air Pollution Control Devices is not required.\nHence, all the remaining industrial units have complied with the\nprovisions of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act,\n1981.\nSubmitted for the kind information of the Hon'ble Punjab and\nHaryana High Court for issue of appropriate order in the case.\"\n'\nBHAG SINGH v. STATE [PASAYAT, J.]\n189\n3. Taking note of the report, the High Court disposed of the Writ A\nPetition specifically directing that the pollution norms and standards have\nto be verified periodically and if there was found to be any deviation, action\nwas to be taken.\n4. In support of the appeal, learned counsel for the appellants submitted\nthat in the new Master Plan 2000-2021 the properties in question fall within\nSector 10 which is earmarked as a residential area. Therefore, the High\nCourt's judgment is not in order.\n5. The stand is resisted by the respondents pointing out that as yet\nthe new Master Plan has not become operative and has not been notified\nand, therefore, the grievances of the appellants are without any basis.\n6. In this connection, the affidavit filed by the State of Punjab in\ncompliance of this Court's order dated 7.2.2005 is relevant. A few paragraphs\nof the affidavit need to be noted.\n\"3. That Master Plan was prepared by this department which was\npublished in the Punjab Govt. Gazette vide Notification No.8/9/84-\n1HGIV/1079 dated 18.1.1989 for public suggestions/objections.\nHowever the same was non-statutory.\n4. That Mandi Gobindgarh, the city in question, does not fall under\nany duly notified Controlled Area, declared under the provisions of\nthe Punjab Scheduled Roads and Controlled Areas (Restriction) of\nUn-regulated Development Act, 1963, now repealed. Thus there are\nno Controlled Area restrictions at Mandi Gobindgarh, in view of the\nabove legal position.\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\n10. That the Secretary, Housing and Urban Development Department\nof the Govt. of Punjab in compliance with the orders of Hon'ble\nSupreme Court has also convened a meeting on 31.5.2005 to\ndiscuss the issue with the concerned Departments viz. Department\nof Industries and Commerce, Department of Science and Technology\nand Environment, Punjab Pollution Control Board, Chief\nAdministrator, PUDA, Department of Local Government, Chief\nTown Planner, Punjab etc. to take an overall view of the latest\nposition. During the course of discussion, it was unanimously H\ni\n190\nA\nB\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 1 S.C.R.\nagreed upon that all the Departments (Punjab Pollution Control\nBoard in particular) shall be more strict in initiating penal action\nagainst the units violating environmental laws, not only against\nthose which are party to the present Special Leave Petition but\nagainst all those who are violating the Master Plan. This would\nensure compliance of the orders of the Hon'ble High Court passed\nin the present case.\"\n7. Since the Master plan which forms the foundation of the appellants?\nchallenge has not yet been notified, the effect thereof cannot be considered\nat this juncture. When the writ petition was filed the old Master Plan was\nC in force and continues to be in force. If, as and when there is any change\nintroduced by any subsequent Master Plan, the effect thereof has to be\nconsidered in terms of the Notification of the said Master Plan. That being\nthe position, this appeal deserves dismissal which we direct. There will be\nno order as to costs.\n+\n}\nD\nB.B.B.\nAppeal dismissed.\n"}
