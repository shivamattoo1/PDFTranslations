Therefore the finding recorded\nis unsustainable even on appreciation of evidence.\n[Paras 54, 57 and 58] [208-B-C; 209-E-F]\nB\nC\n3.2. The courts have been exercising their discretion\nby adopting different methods, viz. Sales Statistics\nMethod, Capitalization of Net Income Method and\nAgriculture Yield Basis Method. Normally where the\ncompensation is awarded on agricultural yield or\ncapitalization method basis, the principle of multiplier is\nalso applied for final determination. These are broadly the\nmethods which are applied by the courts with further\nreduction on account of development charges. In some\ncases, depending upon the peculiar facts, this Court has\naccepted the principle of granting compound increase at\nD the rate of 10% to 15% of the fair market value determined\nin accordance with law to avoid any unfair loss to the\nclaimants suffering from compulsive acquisition.\nHowever, this consideration should squarely fall within\nthe parameters of Section 23 while taking care that the\nE negative mandate contained in Section 24 of the Act is\nnot offended. How one or any of the principles is to be\napplied by the courts, would depend on the facts and\ncircumstances of a given case.

In the present case, the court has declined to\nSPECIAL LAND ACQUISITION OFFICER v.\nKARIGOWDA \u0026 ORS.\n175\naccept the method adopted by the Collector for granting A\ncompensation to the claimants for the reason that the\nSLAO ought not to have taken recourse to the method\nof sale statistics. It was further recorded that no sale\ninstances of the village in question, three years prior to\n2002 were available and instances of adjacent village B\nshould not have been taken into consideration. Instead,\nthe market value should have been calculated by\nadopting capitalization method and no reason was stated\nas to why this method was not applied. [Para 62] [211-F-\nH; 212-A]\n3.4. The Reference Court fell in error of law in stating\nthat the lands of the adjacent or nearby villages could not\nhave been taken into consideration. It is a settled principle\nof law that lands of adjacent villages can be made the\nbasis for determining the fair market value of the acquired\nland. The evidence tendered in relation to the land of the\nadjacent villages would be a relevant piece of evidence\nfor such determination. Once it is shown that situation and\npotential of the land in two different villages are the same\nthen they could be awarded similar compensation or\nsuch other compensation as would be just and fair.\n[Paras 62 and 64] [212-B-C, F-G; 213-A-B]\nC\nD\nE\nKanwar Singh and Ors. v.

The sale instances can be taken into\nconsideration by the Court and benefit of the highest\ninstance can be granted to the claimants in accordance\nwith law in fixing the market value of the acquired land.\nWhatever benefit accrues to the claimants from the H\n1\ni\n176 SUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2010] 5 S.C.R.\nA record produced and proved by the respondents, cannot\nbe denied to them just because they have not produced\nevidence by way of sale instances. [Para 71] [218-E-F]\nB\nC\nD\n3.6. The sale instances which were taken into\nconsideration by the SLAO, and which were part of the\nreference file show that there was an increasing trend in\nthe sale price of the land in these villages. In view of the\ndate of the notification u/s. 4 shows that all the sale\ninstances of the adjacent comparable lands are in\nproximity of time to the date of notification u/s. 4 of the.\nAct. Since the sale instances relied upon are nearly\naround 1 to 2 Â½ years prior to the date of notification, they\nare relevant considerations and, therefore, the claimants\nare entitled to an increase at the rate of 15% per annum\ncompounded. [Para 72] [218-G; 219-C-D]\n3.7. The increase is justified and equitable - firstly,\non the ground that there was increasing trend in the sale\nprice of that land and secondly, the lands acquired were\nbeing used by the agriculturists for production of\nE mulberry crops which had a restrictive use in the\nmanufacturing, commercial or industrial activities i.e.\nfeeding the silk worms which are ultimately used for\nproduction of silk thread. The court cannot use this\nadmitted restricted use to the disadvantage of the land\nowners and some benefit should be given to them while\nbalancing the equities in accordance with law. The\nconcept of fair compensation payable for the acquired\nland is embodied in the Act itself, particularly in view of\nsecondly and fifthly of Section 23 of the Act. In fact, the\nState Government itself has given some additional\ncompensation to the claimants for mulberry crops which\nwere standing at the time of submerging. This stand of\nthe State Government is reasonable and fair. [Para 73]\n[219-E-H; 220-A]\nF\nG\nH\n3.8. The claimants, by leading definite evidence have\nSPECIAL LAND ACQUISITION OFFICER v.\nKARIGOWDA \u0026 ORS.\n177\nshown on record that the lands in question are not only A\nlands having regular source of irrigation through the\nbackwaters but otherwise are also lands superior to the\nother garden lands used for ordinary agricultural\nactivities. The fields in question are being used\nexclusively for growing mulberry crops. Mulberry leaves B\nare the only and the specified food for cocoons. The\nagricultural purpose for which the fields in question are\nbeing used is a special purpose and the crop so grown\nis again used for a specific commercial purpose to which\nthere is no other alternative. [Para 73] [220-E-G]\nC\nD\nE\n3.9. In the present cases, the claimants have not only\nlost their agricultural land but they have also been\ndeprived of seasonal income that was available to them\nas a result of sale of mulberry leaves. Deprivation of\nlivelihood is a serious consideration. The court is entitled\nto apply some kind of reasonable guess work to balance\nthe equities and fix just and fair market value in terms of\nthe parameters specified under Section 23 of the Act. The\nSLAO has ignored both these aspects firstly providing of\nannual increase, and secondly, giving some weightage\nto the special agricultural purpose and the purpose for\nwhich the mulberry crop had to be utilized. The claimants\nhave not proved and produced sale instances. They have\nalso not produced on record any specific evidence to\njustify the compensation awarded to them by the F\nReference Court and/or the High Court. There is hardly\nany evidence, much less a cogent and impeccable\nevidence to support the increase on the basis of net\nincome capitalization method. [Para 73] [220-G-H; 221-A-\nC]\n3.10. It is a settled rudiment of law that the Court, in\ngiven facts and circumstances of the case and keeping\nin mind the potentiality and utility of the land acquired,\ncan award higher compensation to ensure that injustice\nG\nH\n178 SUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2010] 5 S.C.R.\nA is not done to the claimants and they are not deprived of\ntheir property without grant of fair compensation. While\nadopting the average sale method as the formula for\nawarding compensation to the claimants, in the peculiar\nfacts and circumstances of the case and the fact that the\nB land is being compulsorily acquired, the claimants should\nbe awarded a higher compensation. The compensation\nat the rate of Rs. 2,30,000/- per acre for the wet land and\nat the rate of Rs. 1,53,400/- per acre for the dry land would\nbe just and fair compensation and would do complete\nC justice between the parties. As far as claimants are\nconcerned, they have not produced and proved any sale\ninstance and they have not even brought on record any\nspecific evidence to justify their claims relatable to and\nbased upon net income capitalization method. In fact, the\nclaimants have failed to discharge their onus fully and\nsatisfactorily. [Para 73] [221-D-H; 222-A]\nD\nE\nLand Acquisition Officer, A.P. V. Kamadana\nRamakrishna Rao (2007) 3 SCC 526, referred to\n3.11. The determination of the market value by\ncapitalization of yield method will depend upon the\nagricultural yield, that is, value of agricultural produce\nless expenditure for growing them, and not with reference\nto a further sericultural activity by using the agricultural\nF produce. Therefore, what could be capitalized for\ndetermination of market value was the value of mulberry\nleaves used for sericulture and not the value of silk\ncocoons produced by feeding such mulberry leaves to\nthe silkworms. The yield of silk cocoons is the result of\nfurther human effort and industry, value of which\nobviously cannot be capitalized for the purpose of\narriving at the market value of the agricultural land. [Para\n74] [222-B-D]\nG\n3.12. Keeping in mind the facts and circumstances\nH of the case, it will also be just and fair to adopt some\nSPECIAL LAND ACQUISITION OFFICER v.\nKARIGOWDA \u0026 ORS.\n179\nliberal approach with some element of guess work to A\nprovide the claimants with just and fair market value of\nthe land in question. The entire land including the village\nin question and all other villages was acquired for the\npurpose of submerging the lands because of the water\ncoming from the Hemavathi Dam. It will be just, fair, B\nequitable and in consonance with Sections 23 and 24 of\nthe Act that the market value of the land as on 04.04.2002\ncan safely be taken as Rs. 2,30,000/- per acre in the case\nof garden land and, applying the accepted principle of\nreducing the said compensation in the case of dry lands\nby one third, the rate will be Rs.1,53,400/- per acre in the\ncase of dry land keeping in view the peculiar facts and\ncircumstances of the present case and the evidence on\nrecord.

The Reference Court as well as the High Court E\ncould not have granted any interest under the provisions\nof the Act, for a date anterior to the issuance of\nNotification u/s. 4 of the Act. The provision of the Act\nclearly lays down the procedure required to be followed\nwhile taking possession of the acquired land. The words\n\"from the date on which he took the possession of the\nland\" occurring in Section 20 would mean lawful taking\nof possession. Once notification under Section 4 (1) of\nthe Act has been issued and the acquisition proceedings\nculminated into an award in terms of Section 11, then\nalone the land vests in the State free of any encumbrance\nor restriction in terms of provisions of Section 16 of the\nAct. The Court, in situations where possessions has been\ntaken prior to issuance of notification under Section 4(1)\nof the Act, can direct the Collector to examine the extent\nof rent or damage that the owners of land would be\nG\nH\n180 SUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2010] 5 S.C.R.\nA entitled to. The provisions of s. 48 of the Act would come\nto aid and the court would also be justified in issuing\nappropriate direction. However, the Collector is directed\nto examine the question of payment of rent/damages to\nthe claimants, from the period when their respective lands\nwere submerged under the back water of the river, till the\ndate of issuance of the Notification u/s. 4(1) of the Act,\nfrom which date, they would be entitled to the statutory\nbenefits on the enhanced compensation.

The Government Authorities are expected to\nD advert to the factors relating to the pendency of various\nappeals including those before the Reference Court and\ntake steps at the earliest to remedy the legal grievances\nraised by the claimants at different levels of justice\nadministration system. Despite its might, the State is\nE expected to be a responsible and reluctant litigant as\nthere is obligation upon the State to act fairly and for the\nbenefit of the public at large. It will be in harmony with\nthe principle of proper administration that State also takes\ndecisions which would avoid unnecessary litigation. An\nestablished maxim \"Boni judicis est lites dirimere, ne lis ex\nlite oritur, et interest reipublicae ut sint fines litium,\" casts a\nduty upon the court to bring litigation to an end or at least\nendure that if possible, no further litigation arises from the\ncases pending before the Court in accordance with law.\nThis doctrine would be applicable with greater emphasis\nwhere the judgment of the Court has attained finality\nbefore the highest court.
