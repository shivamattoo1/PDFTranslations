The conciliation effort\nhaving failed, a reference was made by the State Government to the Labour\nE Court, which held that the employer contravened provisions of s.6-N of the\nU.P. Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 and directed reinstatement of the worker\nwith 50% back wages. The High Court having not interfered with order of\nreinstatement and merely reducing the back wages to 25%, the Uttaranchal\nForest Development Corporation filed the appeal.\nF\nAllowing the appeal in part, the Court\nHELD: 1. The Conciliation Officer purported to have condoned the delay.\nHe could not do so. There is no dispute that the U.P. Industrial Disputes Act,\n1947 does not provide for any period of limitation. But it is now well settled\nthat the relief to which a workman would be entitled to in such a situation\nG would depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case.

For the said purpose, several factors are required to be taken into\nB\nconsideration, one of them being as to whether such an appointment had been\nmade in terms of the statutory rules. Delay in raising an industrial dispute\nis also a relevant fact. [Para 9] [117-C, D, E]\nHaryana State Electronics Development Corporation v. Mamni, AIR\n(2006) SC 2427; North-Eastern Karnataka Rt.

In the instant case, the respondent was engaged as a daily wager D\nfor a short period from 1.8.1989 to 24.11.1991 and raised an industrial dispute\nafter six years. In these circumstances interest of justice would be met if the\nimpugned judgments are substituted by an award of compensation for a sum\nof Rs. 75,000/- in favour of the respondent. [Paras 6 and 14]\n[116-G; 118-G-H; 119-A]\nE\nCIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 921 of 2007.\nFrom the Final Judgment and Order dated 2.9.2005 of the High Court of\nUttranchal at Nainital in WP No. 914/2003 (M/S).\nRachana Srivastava for the Appellant.\nF\nRachana Joshi Issar, Bij Rajesh and Kapil Saxena for the Respondent.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nS.B. SINHA, J. 1. Leave granted.\nG\n2. Appellant (Corporation) herein is a Corporation incorporated under\nU.P. Forest Development Corporation Act. It is a successor of the UP Forest\nCorporation. It engages seasonal workers as and when any requirement arises\ntherefor. Respondent was employed as a daily wager by the Corporation on\nor about 1.8.1989. His services were terminated on 24.11.1991. He allegedly H\n116\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 3 S.C.R.\nA completed 240 days' of continuous work in a period of twelve months preceding\nthe order of termination. He did not raise any industrial dispute for a long\ntime. He approached the Conciliation Officer on or about 2.9.1996 i.e after a\nperiod of about 6 years. Conciliation effort between the parties having failed,\na reference was made by the State of Uttranchal for adjudication of the\nfollowing dispute to the Labour Court.\nB\nC\n\"Whether dispensation with the services of Shri Mohan Chand Joshi\nson of Sh. N.B. Joshi, Field Assistant w.e.f. 24.11.1991 by the employer\nis valid and/or legal? If not, what benefit/damages along with other\nbenefits the workman is entitled for.\"\n3. By reason of an award dated 28.4.2003, the Labour Court opining that\nthe appellant herein contravened the provisions of Section 6N of U.P. Industrial\nDisputes Act, 1947 directed the reinstatement of the respondent with 50% of\nback wages with effect from 9.9.1997. Aggrieved thereby and dissatisfied\ntherewith, a writ petition was filed by the appellant herein which was allowed\nD in part by reason of the impugned judgment reducing the back wages to 25%.\nE\nF\nG\nH\n4. Ms. Rachna Srivastava, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of\nthe appellant would submit that keeping in view the fact that the respondent\nwas appointed as a daily wager on a temporary basis and that too for\nseasonal work, the impugned judgment cannot be sustained.\n5. Mrs. Rachana Joshi Issar, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of\nthe respondent, on the other hand, urged that it is a fit case where this Court,\nhaving regard to the fact situation obtaining in the case, should not interfere\nwith the impugned judgment. Our attention in this behalf is drawn to an order\nof the Division Bench of this Court dated 19.7.2004 passed in Regional\nManager, U.P.S.R.T.C. \u0026 Anr. v. Kamal Kumar, [RP No. 1886/2003 in SLP(C)\nNo. 24118 of 2002].\n6. The fact that the respondent was appointed as a daily wager is not\nin dispute. He had worked with the Corporation for a very short period namely\nfrom 1.8.1989 to 24.11.1991. As noticed hereinbefore, an industrial dispute was\nraised only on 2.9.1996.\n7. The Conciliation Officer purported to have condoned the delay. He\ncould not do so. There is no dispute that the U.P. Industrial Disputes Act\ndoes not provide for any period of limitation. But it is now well settled that\n+\nUTTRANCHAL FOREST DEVELOPMENT CORPRN. v. M.C. JOSHI {S.B. SINHA, J.] 117\nthe relief to which a workman would be entitled to in such a situation would\ndepend upon the facts and circumstances of each case.\n8. We may notice that recently this Court in Employers in relation to\nthe Management of Sudamdih Colliery of M/s. Bharat Coking Coal Ltd. v.\nTheir Workman represented by Rashtriya Colliery Mazdoor Sangh, JT (2006)\n1 SC 411 opined:-\n“10. So far as delay in seeking the reference is concerned, no\nformula of universal application can be laid down. It would depend on\nfacts of each individual case.\"\nA\nB\nC\n9. Although according to the learned counsel appearing on behalf of\nthe appellant the Labour Court and the High Court committed an error in\narriving at a finding that in terminating the services of the respondent, the\nprovisions of Section 6N of the UP Industrial Disputes Act were contravened,\nwe will proceed on the basis that the said finding is correct. The question,\nhowever, would be as to whether in a situation of this nature, relief of\nD\nreinstatement in services should have been granted. It is now well-settled by\nreason of a catena of decisions of this Court that, the relief of reinstatement\nwith full back wages. would not be granted automatically only because it\nwould be lawful to do so. For the said purpose, several factors are required\nto be taken into consideration, one of them being as to whether such an\nappointment had been made in terms of the statutory rules. Delay in raising E\nan industrial dispute is also a relevant fact.\n10. In Haryana State Electronics Development Corporation v. Mamni,\nAIR (2006) SC 2427, this Court directed payment of compensation. Similar\norders were passed in North-Eastern Karnataka Rt. Corporation v. Ashappa,\n[2006] 5 SCC 137 and U.P. State Road Transport Corporation v. Man Singh,\n[2006] 7 SCC 752.\nF\n11. In Man Singh (supra) it was held :-\n\"7. The respondent admittedly raised a dispute in 1986, i.e. after a\nperiod of about 12 years, it may be true that in an appropriate case,\nas has been done by the Labour Court, delay in raising the dispute\nwould have resulted in rejection of his claim for back wages for the\nperiod during which the workman remains absent as has been held by\nthis Court in Gurmail Singh v. Principal, Govt. College of Education.\nBut the discretionary relief, in our opinion, must be granted upon\nG\nH\n118\nA\nB\nC\nD\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 3 S.C.R.\ntaking into consideration all attending circumstances. The appellant is\na statutory corporation Keeping in view the fact that the respondent\nwas appointed on a temporary basis, it was unlikely that he remained\nunemployed for such a long time. In any event, it would be wholly\nunjust at this distance of time. i.e. after a period of more than 30 years,\nto direct reinstatement of the respondent in service. Unfortunately,\nthe Labour Court or the High Court did no consider these aspects of\nthe matter.\n8. Keeping in view the particular facts and circumstances of this\ncase, we are of the opinion that instead and in place of the direction\nfor reinstatement of the respondent together with back wages from\n1986, interest of justice would be subserved if the appellant is directed\nto pay a sum of Rs. 50,000 to him. Similar orders, we may place on\nrecord, have been passed by this Court in State of Rajasthan v.\nGhyan Chand, State of MP v. Arjunlal Rajak, Nagar Mahapalika\n(now Municipal Corporation) v. State of U.P., and Haryana State\nElectronics Development Corporation Ltd. v. Mamni.\"\n12. The unreported decision of this Court in Regional Manager,\nU.P.S.R.T.C. \u0026 Anr. v. Kamal Kumar (supra) whereupon, Ms. Issar had placed\nstrong reliance is not an authority for the proposition that in each and every\ncase an order of reinstatement is required to be passed. The fact of the said\nE matter is not known. Furthermore it was passed in a Review Petition. It\nappears that one of the questions which arose for consideration was whether\nservices of a daily wager should be regularized or not and in that situation,\nwhile directing that the concerned workman to be reinstated only as a daily\nwager but case of the workman for regularization was directed to be considered\nin terms of a purported scheme existing in this behalf.\nF\n13. The legal position has since undergone a change in the light of a\nConstitution Bench decision of this Court in Secretary, State of Karnataka\n\u0026 Ors. v. Uma Devi (3) \u0026 Ors., [2006] 4 SCC 1 wherein this Court held that\n'State' within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution of India is under\nG a constitutional obligation to comply with the provisions contained in Articles\n14 and 16 of the Constitution of India.\nH\n14. We are therefore, of the opinion that keeping in view the nature and\nperiod of services rendered by the respondent herein as also the period\nduring which he had worked and the fact that he had raised an industrial\n1\nUTTRANCHAL FOREST DEVELOPMENT CORPRN. v. M.C. JOSHI [S.B. SINHA, J.] 119\ndispute after six years, interest of justice would be met if the impugned A\njudgments are substituted by an award of compensation for a sum of\nRs. 75,000/- in favour of the respondent.\nextent.\n15. We direct accordingly. This appeal is allowed to the aforementioned\n16. In the facts and circumstances of the case, there shall however, be\nno order as to costs.\nB\n+\nR.P.\nAppeal partly allowed.\n"}
