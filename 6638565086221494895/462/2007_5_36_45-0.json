MANSUR ALI KHAN AND ORS.\nAPRIL 12, 2007\n[TARUN CHATTERJEE AND P.K. BALASUBRAMANYAN, JJ.]\nCode of Civil Procedure, 1908; O.VII R.10; Ss. 16 and 20:\nSuit for partition-Property lay beyond jurisdiction of trial Court-\nC Trial Court returning the plaint to plaintiff for filing in the Court of\nappropriate jurisdiction-Affirmed by the High Court- On appeal, Held: At\nthe stage of consideration of the return of the plaint in terms of provisions\nunder O.VII R.10 CPC, the plaint and the averment therein must be looked\ninto-It is also necessary to read the plaint in a meaningful manner to\nD ascertain the real intention of the plaintiff-The suit in question is essentially\nfor the relief of partition and declaration in respect of the properties situated\nin a village at Gurgaon, which is outside the jurisdiction of the High Court\nof Delhi-Besides, negative declaration sought for by the plaintiff appears\nto be totally superfluous and unnecessary-In the facts and circumstances of\nthe case, the present suit could not be brought within the purview of the\nproviso to S.16 of the Code or entertained relying on S.20 of the Code on\nthe basis that three out of the five defendants are residing within the\njurisdiction of the Court at Delhi.\nE\nF\nAppellant filed a civil suit before the High Court of Delhi praying for\ndeclaration of the oral Will allegedly made by her mother was never made\nand to declare the sale deed purported to have been executed by defendant No.2\nin favour of defendant Nos. 4 and 5 null and void in respect of certain\nproperties in question and to pass a decree of partition in terms of Islamic\nPersonal Law. The properties in question situated at Gurgaon, District\nHaryana, are outside the jurisdiction of the High Court of Delhi in which the\nG suit was instituted. Single Judge of the High Court holding that since the\nproperties in question situated outside the jurisdiction of the Court at Delhi,\nthe Court at Delhi had no jurisdiction to entertain the suit. Therefore, he\ndirected return of the plaint to appellant for presenting it to the Court having\njurisdiction over the properties in question. Aggrieved, the appellant filed an\nH\n36\nBEGUM SAHIBA SULTAN v. NAWAB MOHD. MANSUR ALI KHAN\n37\nappeal, which was dismissed by the Division Bench of the High Court. Hence A\nthe present appeal.\nAppellant contended that the substantial prayer in the plaint was for a\ndeclaration that the oral Will dated 1.1.1995 allegedly made by the mother\nwas never made and the cause of action for that relief wholly arose in Delhi\nwithin the jurisdiction of the trial court; that the other reliefs of partition,\naccounting and declaration of invalidity of the sale executed by defendant No.2\nwere all reliefs that would flow only if the relief regarding the declaration of\nWill was granted to the plaintiff and consequently, those reliefs could be\nperceived to be only consequential reliefs; that even if Section 16(a) and (d)\nC.P.C. had application, it was a case to which the proviso to Section 16 of the\nCode applied, especially in the context of the fact that at least three of the\ndefendants were residing within the jurisdiction of the trial court, therefore,\nthe decision to return the plaint was unsustainable in law.\nB\nC\nE\nRespondents submitted that in pith and substance, the plaint was for\npartition of the properties situated in Village Pataudi in Gurgaon that lay D\noutside the territorial jurisdiction of the court at Delhi and when that is so,\nthe suit had to be instituted only in the court having jurisdiction over the\nproperty in question and the High Court was right in holding that Section\n16(b) and (d) of the Code squarely applied to the case on hand in the light of\nthe reliefs claimed; that the proviso to Section 16 of the Code has no\napplication, since this was not a case where mere personal obedience to the\ndecree would result in an effective decree; that Section 20 of the Code will\nhave no application in a case where Section 16 squarely applies, since Section\n20 was only a residuary provision; and that the High Court has understood\nthe plaint in a particular manner and since an effective decree for partition,\nwhich is the main relief claimed in the plaint, could more conveniently be F\npassed by the court having jurisdiction over the properties in question; and\nthat it was not a fit case where this Court ought to exercise its jurisdiction\nunder Article 136 of the Constitution of India.\nDismissing the appeal, the Court\nHELD: 1.1. There is no doubt that at the stage of consideration of the\nreturn of the plaint under Order VII Rule 10 of the Code, what is to be looked\ninto is the plaint and the averments therein. At the same time, it is also\nnecessary to read the plaint in a meaningful manner to find out the real\nintention behind the suit. [Para 10] [43-C]\nG\nH\nA\nB\n38\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 5 S.C.R.\nMessrs Moolji Jaitha \u0026 Co. v. The Khandesh Spinning \u0026 Weaving Mills\nCo. Ltd., A.I.R. [1950] Federal Court 83; T.

Reading the plaint as a whole in this case, there cannot be much\ndoubt that the suit is essentially in relation to the relief of partition and\ndeclaration in respect of the properties situate in Village Pataudi, Gurgaon,\noutside the jurisdiction of the Court at Delhi. It is no doubt true that there is\nan averment that an alleged oral will said to have been made at Delhi by the\nC deceased mother and presumably relied on by defendants 1 and 2 was never\nmade. But this Court has failed to understand the need for claiming such a\nnegative declaration. After all, the plaintiff can sue for partition, rendition of\naccounts and for setting aside the alienation effected by defendant No. 2 without\nthe junction of the plaintiff on a claim that he is also one of the heirs of the\ndeceased mother. If in such a suit, the defendants propound any oral Will as\nD excluding the plaintiff from inheritance, the burden would be on them to\nestablish the making of such an oral Will and the validity thereof. The\nnegative declaration sought for by the plaintiff appears to be totally superfluous\nand unnecessary in the circumstances of the case. [Para 11] [44-C-E]\nE\n1.3. It is not the case of the plaintiff that an oral Will was made at Delhi.\nIt is the case of the plaintiff that no oral Will was made at Delhi. It is debatable\nwhether in such a situation it can be said that any cause of action arose at all\nwithin the jurisdiction of the Court at Delhi. On a reading of the plaint, the\ntrial judge and the Division Bench of the High Court have come to the\nconclusion that in substance the suit was one relating to immovable property\nF situated outside the jurisdiction of the trial Court in Delhi and hence the plaint\nhad been presented in a Court having no jurisdiction to entertain the suit.\nThis Court is inclined to agree with the said understanding of the plaint by\nthe trial judge and Division Bench of the High Court, on a reading of the\nplaint as a whole. [Para 11] [44-E-G]\nG\nH\n1.4. On a reading of the plaint as a whole, it is clear that the suit is one\nwhich comes within the purview of Section 16(b) and (d) of the Code. The relief\nof partition, accounting and declaration of invalidity of the sale executed in\nrespect of immovable property situated in Village Pataudi, Gurgaon, could\nnot entirely be obtained by a personal obedience to the decree by the defendants\nin the suit. Applying the test laid down therein, it is clear that the present\nBEGUM SAHIBA SULTAN v. NAWAB MOHD. MANSUR ALI KHAN [BALASUBRAMANYAN, J.] 39\nsuit could not be brought within the purview of the proviso to Section 16 of A\nthe Code or entertained relying on Section 20 of the Code on the basis that\nthree out of the five defendants are residing within the jurisdiction of the\ncourt at Delhi. Hence, the trial Court was right in returning the plaint to the\nplaintiff for being presented to the proper Court.\n[Para 12 and 13] [44-H; 45-B-D]\nB\nHarshad Chiman Lal Modi v.

The appellant, hereinafter referred to as the plaintiff, is the daughter\nof Nawab Iftikar Ali Khan and Mehar Taj Sajeda Sultan. Defendants 1 and 2,\nwho are respondents 1 and 2 herein, are her siblings. Defendant No.3 is her\nniece, being the daughter of her brother, Defendant No.1. Defendant Nos.4\nand 5 are assignees from Defendant No.2.\nE\nF\n3. The plaintiff filed a suit C.S. (OS) No.495 of 2004 on the original side\nof the High Court of Delhi praying for the following reliefs:\n\"(a) Pass a decree of declaration declaring the oral Will dated 1.1.1995\nallegedly made by Her Highness Begum Mehar Taj Sajida Sultan was\nnever made, further declare that the Sale deed purported to have been G\nexecuted on behalf of Defendant No.2 in favour of Defendant No.4\nand 5 as null and void;\n(b) to pass a decree of partition in favour of the plaintiff in respect\nof her entitled share in view of the Islamic Personal Law i.e. 1/4 of total\nproperties/estates, out of 180 Kanals and 12 Morlas situated at Village H\nT\n40\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\n[1]\nF\nG\nH\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 5 S.C.R.\nPataudi, Gurgaon left behind by above mentioned Her Highness Mehar\nTaj Sajida Sultan;\n(c) Pass a decree of rendition of account in respect of the earnings\nof the above mentioned properties w.e.f.

The immovable properties that were sought to be partitioned and\nalienation in respect of which was sought to be declared void, were admittedly\nsituated in Village Pataudi, Gurgaon in the State of Haryana, outside the\njurisdiction of the Court in which the suit was instituted. The suit was filed\nin the Court at Delhi on the basis of the following averments in the plaint:\n\"The cause of action for filing the present suit arose on 1.1.1995 when\nthe alleged oral Will was made by Her Highness Mehar Taj Begum\nSajida Sultan at New Delhi, the cause of action arose on 25.9.1995\nwhen Defendant No.1 organised a meeting. It again arose somewhere\nin March/April when the plaintiff got knowledge and on 22.10.2002\nwhen the plaintiff issued legal notice. It further arose on 28.11.2002\nand 30.11.2002 when the notices were replied and the same still\nsubsists.\nThat Defendant No.1 and 2 reside at Delhi. The cause of action arose\nat Delhi, as according to Defendants themselves alleged oral Will was\nmade at New Delhi; threats of parting with the possession was also\nissued at Delhi hence this Hon'ble court has jurisdiction to entertain\nand try the present suit.\"\n5. The defendants raised an objection to the jurisdiction of the trial\ncourt. They pleaded that the main relief sought in the plaint was for partition\nof the properties situate in Gurgaon, not falling within the jurisdiction of Delhi\ncourt and the declarations sought for are also related to the said properties\nBEGUM SAHIBA SULTAN ». NAWAB MOHD. MANSUR ALI KHAN [BALASUBRAMANYAN, J.] 41\nand in the light of Section 16(b)and (d) of the Code of Civil Procedure (for A\nshort 'the Code'), the jurisdiction to entertain the suit was with the concerned\ncourt in the State of Haryana and hence the plaint was liable to be rejected.\nOn their behalf, the following averment in paragraph 3(d) of the plaint was\nemphasised.\n\"Present suit is being confined to the properties situated at Village B\nPataudi, Gurgaon (Haryana), left behind by the mother who had\npurchased these properties. So far as the other properties either left\nbehind by their mother, father or other relatives are concerned, the\nPlaintiff is reserving her valuable rights to claim in due course, if need\nbe.\"\nThe description of the suit properties set out in paragraph 3(h) was also relied\non.\nC\n6. On behalf of the plaintiff, this plea was resisted by contending that\nthe first declaration regarding the alleged oral Will of the mother wholly arose\nD\nwithin the jurisdiction of the court at Delhi and since that part of the prayer\nfell within the jurisdiction of the court at Delhi, the court at Delhi had\njurisdiction to entertain the suit. It was contended that the cause of action\nregarding the will and the declaration sought in respect thereof, wholly arose\nin Delhi and that even otherwise, three of the defendants were residing in\nDelhi, within the jurisdiction of the court at Delhi and, in any event, on that E\nground and on the ground that a part of the cause of action arose in Delhi,\nthe suit could be entertained in the court at Delhi in terms of Section 20 of\nthe Code.\nF\n7. The learned Single Judge, the trial Judge, on a reading of the plaint,\ncame to the conclusion that the reliefs claimed in the plaint fell within the\npurview of Section 16(b) and (d) of the Code and that the proviso to Section\n16 had no application. Section 20 could not be resorted to, since Section 16\nhad application and Section 20 applied only if Section 16 had no application.\nOverruling the contention that the first part of the declaratory relief was\nrightly claimed in the court at Delhi, he held that the said declaration was also G\nrelated to the properties situated in village Pataudi, outside the jurisdiction\nof the court at Delhi and hence the court at Delhi had no jurisdiction to\nentertain the suit. The trial judge, therefore, directed the return of the plaint\nto the plaintiff for being presented to the court having jurisdiction. An offer\nmade to the plaintiff to pass an order in terms of Rule 10A of Order VII of\nthe Code was not accepted by the plaintiff. Thus, the plaint was returned to H\n7\n42\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 5 S.C.R.\nA the plaintiff for being presented to the proper court.\nB\nC\nE\n8. The plaintiff filed an appeal against the order before the Division\nBench of the High Court. The Division Bench, on adverting to Section 16 of\nCode and the approach of the trial judge to the question, agreed with the trial\njudge and dismissed the appeal. The Division Bench reiterated that the suit\nwas essentially and in substance for partition and since the property lay\nbeyond the jurisdiction of the trial court, the suit could not be brought within\nthe jurisdiction of the trial court by exhibiting some ingenuity in introducing\na plea regarding an alleged oral Will said to have been brought into existence\nin Delhi, within the jurisdiction of the court. The plaint had to be scrutinised\nfor the real relief sought for therein and so viewed, the trial judge was right\nin returning the plaint for presentation to the proper court. This decision of\nthe Division Bench is in challenge before us.\n9. Learned counsel for the appellant contended that the substantial\nprayer in the plaint was for a declaration that the oral Will dated 1.1.1995\nD allegedly made by the mother Sajida Sultan was never made and the cause\nof action for that relief wholly arose in Delhi within the jurisdiction of the trial\ncourt. He submitted that the other reliefs of partition, accounting and\ndeclaration of invalidity of the sale executed by Defendant No.2 were all\nreliefs that would flow only if the relief regarding the declaration of Will was\ngranted to the plaintiff and consequently, those reliefs could be perceived to\nbe only consequential reliefs. Counsel also pointed out that even if Section\n16(a) and (d) of the Code had application, it was a case to which the proviso\nto Section 16 of the Code applied, especially in the context of the fact that\nat least three of the defendants were residing within the jurisdiction of the\ntrial court. It was, therefore, contended that the decision to return the plaint\nF was unsustainable in law. Counsel for the defendants, on the other hand,\ncontended that in pith and substance, the plaint was for partition of the\nproperties situated in village Pataudi in Gurgaon that lay outside the territorial\njurisdiction of the court at Delhi and when that is so, the suit had to be\ninstituted only in the court having jurisdiction over the property in question\nand the High Court was right in holding that Section 16(b) and (d) of the Code\nsquarely applied to the case on hand in the light of the reliefs claimed.\nCounsel further submitted that the proviso to Section 16 of the Code had no\napplication, since this was not a case where mere personal obedience to the\ndecree would result in an effective decree. He further pointed out that Section\n20 of the Code will have no application in a case where Section 16 squarely\nH applies, since Section 20 was only a residuary provision. He ultimately\nG\n八\nBEGUM SAHIBA SULTAN ». NAWAB MOHD. MANSUR ALI KHAN [BALASUBRAMANYAN, J.]\n43\nsubmitted that the High Court has understood the plaint in a particular A\nmanner and since an effective decree for partition, which is the main relief\nclaimed in the plaint, could more conveniently be passed by the court having\njurisdiction over the properties in question, it was not a fit case where this\nCourt ought to exercise its jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution\nof India, since having the suit tried at Delhi would only create complications\nand prolong the proceedings, even assuming that this Court saw some merit\nin the contention that the first part of prayer (a) might come within the\npurview of the court at Delhi. He therefore submitted that no interference be\nmade with the order now passed.\nB\n10. There is no doubt that at the stage of consideration of the return C\nof the plaint under Order VII Rule 10 of the Code, what is to be looked into\nis the plaint and the averments therein. At the same time, it is also necessary\nto read the plaint in a meaningful manner to find out the real intention behind\nthe suit. In Messrs Moolji Jaitha \u0026 Co. v. The Khandesh Spinning \u0026\nWeaving Mills Co. Ltd., A.I.R. (1950) Federal Court 83], the Federal Court\nobserved that:\n\"The nature of the suit and its purpose have to be determined by\nreading the plaint as a whole.\"\nIt was further observed:\n\"The inclusion or absence of a prayer is not decisive of the true\nnature of the suit, nor is the order in which the prayers are arrayed\nin the plaint. The substance or object of the suit has to be gathered\nfrom the averments made in the plaint and on which the reliefs asked\nin the prayers are based.”\nIt was further observed:\n\"It must be borne in mind that the function of a pleading is only to\nstate material facts and it is for the court to determine the legal result\nof those facts and to mould the relief in accordance with that result.”\n-\nᎠ\nE\n[I\nF\nG\nThis position was reiterated by this Court in T. Arivandandam v. T.V.\nSatyapal \u0026 Anr., [1978] 1 S.C.R. 742 by stating that what was called for was\na meaningful not formal-reading of the plaint and any illusion created\nby clever drafting of the plaint should be buried then and there. In Official\nTrustee, West Bengal \u0026 Ors. v. Sachindra Nath Chatterjee \u0026 Anr., [1969] 3\nS.C.R. 92, this Court approving the statement of the law by Mukherjee Acting H\n44\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 5 S.C.R.\nA Chief Justice in Hirday Nath Roy v. Ramchandra Barna Sarma, [I.L.R. 48\nCalcutta 138 F.B.] held:\nB\n\"Before a court can be held to have jurisdiction to decide a particular\nmatter it must not only have jurisdiction to try the suit brought but\nmust also have the authority to pass the orders sought for. It is not\nsufficient that it has some jurisdiction in relation to the subject-matter\nof the suit. Its jurisdiction must include the power to hear and decide\nthe questions at issue, the authority to hear and decide the particular\ncontroversy that has arisen between the parties.\"\n11. Reading the plaint as a whole in this case, there cannot be much\nC doubt that the suit is essentially in relation to the relief of partition and\nE\ndeclaration in respect of the properties situated in Village Pataudi, Gurgaon,\noutside the jurisdiction of court at Delhi. It is no doubt true that there is an\naverment that an alleged oral will said to have been made at Delhi by the\ndeceased mother and presumably relied on by defendants 1 and 2 was never\nD made. But on our part, we fail to understand the need for claiming such a\nnegative declaration. After all, the plaintiff can sue for partition, rendition of\naccounts and for setting aside the alienation effected by defendant No. 2\nwithout the junction of the plaintiff on a claim that the plaintiff is also one\nof the heirs of the deceased mother. If in such a suit, the defendants propound\nany oral will as excluding the plaintiff from inheritance, the burden would be\non them to establish the making of such an oral will and the validity thereof.\nThe negative declaration sought for by the plaintiff appears to us to be totally\nsuperfluous and unnecessary in the circumstances of the case. It may be\nnoted that it is not the case of the plaintiff that an oral will was made at Delhi.\nIt is the case of the plaintiff that no oral will was made at Delhi. It is debatable\nwhether in such a situation it can be said that any cause of action arose at\nall within the jurisdiction of the court at Delhi. On a reading of the plaint, the\ntrial judge and the Division Bench have come to the conclusion that in\nsubstance the suit was one relating to immovable property situated outside\nthe jurisdiction of the trial court in Delhi and hence the plaint had been\npresented in a court having no jurisdiction to entertain the suit. We are\nG inclined to agree with the said understanding of the plaint by the trial judge\nand Division Bench, on a reading of the plaint as a whole.\nF\n12. On a reading of the plaint as a whole, it is clear, as we have indicated\nabove, that the suit is one which comes within the purview of Section 16(b)\nand (d) of the Code. If a suit comes within Section 16 of the Code, it has been\nH\nBEGUM SAHIBA SULTAN ». NAWAB MOHD. MANSUR ALI KHAN [BALASUBRAMANYAN, J.] 45\nheld by this Court in Harshad Chiman Lal Modi v. DLF Universal Ltd. \u0026 A\nAnr., [2005] 7 S.C.C. 791 that Section 20 of the Code cannot have application\nin view of the opening words of Section 20 “subject to the limitations aforesaid\".\nThis Court has also held that the proviso to Section 16 would apply only if\nthe relief sought could entirely be obtained by personal obedience of the\ndefendant. The relief of partition, accounting and declaration of invalidity of\nB\nthe sale executed in respect of immovable property situated in Village Pataudi,\nGurgaon, could not entirely be obtained by a personal obedience to the\ndecree by the defendants in the suit. We are in respectful agreement with the\nview expressed in the above decision. Applying the test laid down therein,\nit is clear that the present suit could not be brought within the purview of\nthe proviso to Section 16 of the Code or entertained relying on Section 20 C\nof the Code on the basis that three out of the five defendants are residing\nwithin the jurisdiction of the court at Delhi.\n13. Thus, on the whole, we are satisfied that the trial court was right\nin returning the plaint to the plaintiff for being presented to the proper court.\nWe therefore affirm the order returning the plaint and dismiss this appeal. In D\nthe circumstances, we make no order as to costs.\nS.K.S.\nAppeal dismissed.\n"}
