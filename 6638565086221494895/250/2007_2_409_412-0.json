During the period of contract, Respondent was paid a sum of\nRe. 1 for each meter reading. At the expiry of contract period, and in view of D\nappointment of regular Meter Readers, services of Respondent were dispensed\nwith.\nThe Labour Court held that Respondent had worked in the capacity of a\nMeter Reader for a considerably long period; that he had completed service\nof more than 240 days within the preceding twelve months, and he having E\nbeen retrenched without following the procedure provided under s.25-F of the\nIndustrial Disputes Act, 1947, was entitled to be re-instated.

Hence the present appeals.\nAllowing the appeals, the Court\nHELD: There was an agreement governing engagement. The payment\nwas made per meter reading at a fixed rate and there was no regular\nemployment ever offered to any of the respondents. The material on record\nclearly established that the engagement of the respondent was for specific\nperiod and conditional. It appears that on the appointment of regular meter\nreaders, the engagement has been dispensed with. The contracts clearly\ngoverned the terms of engagement.

No. 18634/2003.\nC\nWITH\nC.A. Nos. 649, 650 and 651 of 2007.\nJayshree Anand, Karunakar Mahalik and Ashwani Bhardwaj for the\nAppellants.\nD\nR.K. Kapoor, M.K. Verma and Anis Ahmed Khan for the Respondent.\nE\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nDR. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. 1. Leave granted.\n2. Challenge in these appeals is to the consolidated orders passed by\nthe Division Bench of the Punjab and Haryana High Court dismissing the four\nwrit petitions filed by the appellant No.1-Punjab State Electricity Board (in\nshort the 'Board'). The respondent in each case was engaged as Meter\nReader on contract basis by the appellant-Board. After disengagement he\nmade a claim stating that he had worked for a considerably long continuous\nF period, his services have been terminated by the Board without following any\nprocedure and without payment of retrenchment compensation. Claim for\nreinstatement with back wages was made. On failure of the conciliation\nproceedings, matter was referred by the concerned State Government to the\nPresiding Officer, Labour Court, Ludhiana (hereinafter referred to as the 'Labour\nCourt') under Section 10 of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (in short the\n'Act'). Stand of the appellant before the Labour Court was that the applicant\nwas engaged as private Meter Reader on contract basis which was renewed\non two occasions and at the expiry of the contract period, the services have\nbeen dispensed with. It was specifically averred that the applicant concerned\nhad never been employed by the Board and was not a workman under the\nH provisions of the Act. During the concerned period a sum of Re.1/- for\nG\nх\nPUNJAB STATE ELECTRICITY BOARD v. SUDESH KUMAR PURI [PASAYAT, J.] 411\nreading was paid as per the contract. There was neither any monthly salary A\nnor the claimant could be treated as a person appointed by the Board.\n'3. The Labour Court held that the claimant had been engaged as a Meter\nReader and had worked in that capacity for a considerably long period, his\nservices have been terminated without notice or payment of compensation.\nIt was concluded that the claimant had completed service for more than 240 B\ndays within the preceding twelve months, and he had been retrenched without\nfollowing the procedure provided under Section 25-F of the Act, and as such\nwas entitled to be reinstated. However, the back wages were restricted to 25%.\nThe Board filed writ petitions questioning the award in each case. The claimants\nalso filed writ petitions questioning quantum of back wages.\nC\n4. The High Court referred to a decision of this Court in Steel Authority\nof India Ltd. And Ors. v. National Union Waterfront Workers and Ors., [2001]\n7 SCC 1 in which it was held that the contract was a camouflage by the Board\nwith a view to avoid the provisions of the Act. Accordingly, the writ petitions\nfiled by the appellant - Board were dismissed by the impugned judgment in D\neach case. The writ petitions filed by the respondents were also dismissed\non the ground that they were not engaged on any fixed salary.\n5. Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that without any material,\nthe Labour Court held that the contract was a camouflage. Absolutely no\nmaterial was placed on record to justify such a stand and/or conclusion. It E\nis not in dispute that there was a contract providing for payment of Re.1/-\nfor each meter reading. The contract was renewed more than once. Merely\nbecause the meter reading work has not decreased, that cannot be a basis to\nhold that there was a camouflage adopted.\n6. Learned counsel for the respondents on the other hand submitted\nthat both the Labour Court and the High Court have recorded finding about\nthe camouflage.\n7. At the outset, it has to be noted that the decision in Steel Authority's\nF\ncase (supra) has absolutely no relevance so far as the present dispute is G\nconcerned. That relates to a case of contract labour. Present dispute is not\na case of that nature. On the contrary, it appears from the materials placed\non record that there was an agreement governing engagement. The payment\nwas made per meter reading at a fixed rate and there was no regular employment\never offered to any of the respondents. The provisions of Section 2(00)(bb)\nof the Act clearly applies to the facts of the present case.\nH\n412\nA\nB\nC\nD\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS [2007] 2 S.C.R.\n8. Section 2(00)(bb) reads as follows:\n\"2(00) retrenchment means the termination by the employer of the\nservice of a workman for any reason whatsoever, otherwise than as\na punishment inflicted by way of disciplinary action, but does not\ninclude-\n(a)....\n(b)....\n(bb) termination of the service of the workman as a result of the non-\nrenewal of the contract of employment between the employer and the\nworkman concerned on its expiry or of such contract being terminated\nunder a stipulation in that behalf contained therein; or”\n9. The material on record clearly established that the engagement of the\nrespondent was for specific period and conditional. It appears that on the\nappointment of regular meter readers, the engagement has been dispensed\nwith. The contracts clearly governed the terms of engagement.\n10. Above being the position, the orders passed by the Labour Court\nand the High Court are clearly untenable and are quashed. In two cases the\nconcerned respondents have been engaged again on contractual basis. It\nE shall not be construed that we have expressed any opinion on such subsequent\ncontractual engagement.\nB.B.B.\n11. Appeals are allowed without any order as to costs.\nAppeals allowed.\n:\n+.\n'\n"}
