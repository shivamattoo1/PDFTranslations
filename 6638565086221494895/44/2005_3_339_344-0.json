This appeal, by special leave, is directed against the judgment and\norder dated 16.9.2002 of the Bombay High Court, by which the writ petition\nfiled by the appellant was disposed of with certain directions.\nA\nC\n3. The appellant imported certain consignments of copper cathodes B\nfrom Germany in August, 1998. The consignments were not cleared by the\nappellant from the Port Trust and accordingly they were sold in a public\nauction on 13.1.2000 for Rs. 52,50,000. The Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust,\nMumbai deducted 50 per cent of the sale proceeds i.e. Rs. 26,25,000 towards\nsale expenses. The appellant filed a writ petition in the Bombay High Court\nchallenging the deduction of 50 per cent of the sale proceeds as expenses and\nprayed that the sale proceeds towards expenses of sale on actual basis only.\nshould be deducted and the balance amount should be paid to the appellant.\nThe High Court took the view that the controversy raised by the appellant\ninvolved adjudication of facts which was not possible in a writ petition filed\nunder Article 226 of the Constitution. The writ petition was accordingly D\ndisposed of permitting the appellant to pursue ordinary civil remedy for\nredressal of its grievance.\nF\n4. In response to the notice issued, the respondents have filed a counter\naffidavit. It is averred therein that Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust was incorporated\nunder the Major Port Trusts Act, 1963 and it renders services in accordance E\nwith the aforesaid Act. The core function of the Port is to provide storage\nspace for bulk and containarised cargo, which is stored in the Board premises.\nSuch storage facilities are to facilitate international trade and to attract\ninternational shipping lines to the Port for promoting trade in the national\ninterest. Any delay in clearing or removing the cargo attracts demurrage\ncharges. The importers/consignees are given 15 free days to take delivery of\nthe cargo. If the cargo is unclaimed for two months, it is put for sale under\nSections 61 and 62 of the Major Port Trust Act, as the case may be. Congestion\nin Ports affects the free movement of ships and all essential goods. The Port\ndoes not do any business of warehousing and it performs statutory functions.\nThe scheme of the Major Port Trusts Act is to frame the scale of rates of G\npenalties, rent, charges, expenses in such a manner which will act as an\nincentive and compulsion for the expeditious removal of the goods/cargo\nfrom the transit area. Ships, wagons, containers, cargo have to be kept moving\nand that can happen only if there is some kind of pressure on the importer\nto remove the goods from the Board's premises with the utmost expedition.\nH\n342\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2005] 3 S.C.R.\nA The rates and charges which the Board is entitled to recover have been\nframed under the Major Port Trusts Act so as to ensure that the Ports are\ncongestion free, both for purposes of movement of ships and movement of\ncargo.\nC\n5. It is further averred that the Board of Trustees vide Item Nos.17 and\nB 18 of the Agenda of the 92nd Board Meeting held on 31.1.1992 approved the\nformula for fixing of reserve price. The Board thereafter started disposal of\nthe unclaimed cargo as per the said procedure, but the rate of disposal was\nnot commensurate with the generation of longstanding containers, resulting\nin occupation of valuable space in the container yard by such longstanding\ncontainers. In order to find a solution to the problem, the matter was placed\nbefore the Board in its meeting held on 25.7.1997 for reconsideration of the\nmethod for fixing the reserve price. A revised formula was then adopted\nwhich also was not found to be working satisfactorily. Certain suggestions\nwere received from the Commissioner of Customs and finally a resolution\nwas passed in the meeting of the Board held on 23.7.1999, which reads as\nD under:\n(1)\nE\n\"Treating 50% of sale proceeds as sale expenses which shall be\nfirst charge on the sale proceeds and customs duty and other claims\nas per order laid down in MPT Act of 1963 and applying the formula\nas approved by the Board vide TR No. 492/97 dated 25.7.1997 in all\nthe previous cases where auction has already been held.\nFixing of reserve price as the sum of Custom duty plus 4 months'\nground rent.\"\n6. It is further averred in the counter affidavit that as it is virtually\nF impossible to ascertain the exact sale expenses in respect of each lot and,\ntherefore, a decision has been taken to treat 50 per cent of the sale proceeds\nas sale expenses. The sale expenses normally vary from lot to lot and are\ndependent upon the amounts realized in each sale. For the purposes of auction,\nan auction hall, godown of 7000 sq. meters meant for storage of uncleared\ngoods to container yards for keeping longstanding cargo of uncleared goods\nhas to be arranged. A notification is published in the Government Gazette\nand advertisement is issued in all leading newspapers in English, Hindi,\nMarathi and Gujarati. The Port Trust has also to make available services of\nits officers and staff, such as Deputy Manager, Assistant Manager,\nSuperintendent, Junior Engineers, Checkers, Clerks and Peons, etc.\nG\nH\n1\n1\n1\nGUJARAT CYPROMET LTD. v. U.O.I. [G.P. MATHUR, J.]\n343\n7. In the counter affidavit details have also been given regarding the A\nactual expenses incurred by the Port Trust and the amount realized on the\nbasis of the current formula of charging 50 per cent of the sale proceeds\ntowards sale expenses, which show that the actual expenses exceeded the\namount so recovered and the Port Trust suffered a loss. It is further averred\nthat in most cases, the Port Trust is unable to recover its entire dues from the\nB\nsale of cargo from longstanding containers.\n8. Though the principal prayer made in the writ petition was to quash\nthe Resolution No. 624 dated 23.7.1999 of the Port Trust whereunder it was\nresolved that 50 per cent of the sale proceeds in a consignment be appropriated\ntowards expenses of the sale, learned counsel for the appellant has not been C\nable to point out any ground as to how the said resolution is invalid. Section\n63 of the Major Port Trusts Act, 1963 reads as under :\n“63.Application of sale proceeds - (1) The proceeds of every sale\nunder Section 61 or Section 62 shall be applied in the following\norder―\n(a) in payment of the expenses of the sale;\n(b) in payment, according to their respective priorities, of the lines\nand claims excepted in Sub-section (2) of Section 59 from the\npriority of the lien of the Board;\n(c) in payment of the rates and expenses of landing, removing, storing\nor warehousing the same, and of all other charges due to the\nBoard in respect thereof, including demurrage (other thar. penal\ndemurrage) payable in respect of such goods for a period of four\nmonths from the date of landing;\n(d) in payment of any penalty or fine due to the Central Government\nunder any law for the time being in force relating to customs;\n(e) in payment of any other sum due to the Board.\nD\nE\nF\n(2) The surplus, if any, shall be paid to the importer, owner or\nconsignee of the goods or to his agent, on an application made by G\nhim in this behalf within six months from the date of the sale of the\ngoods.\n(3) Where no application has been made under Sub-section (2), the\nsurplus shall be applied by the Board for the purposes of this Act.\"\nH\n!\nA\nB\n344\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2005] 3 S.C.R.\n9. Section 61 of the Act empowers the Board, after the expiry of two\nmonths from the time when any goods have passed into its custody (other\nthan animals, perishable or hazardous goods) to sell by public auction, the\ngoods so removed. Section 62 of the Act also empowers the Board to sell the\ngoods by public auction which after landing thereof are not removed by the\nowner or other person entitled thereto from the premises of the Board within\none month from the date on which such goods were placed in their custody.\nIn view of these statutory provisions, the Board was perfectly justified in\nselling the unclaimed cargo by public auction. As explained in the counter\naffidavit filed by the respondents, it is not possible to precisely determine the\nexpenses of sale in each case on account of various factors involved. Therefore,\nC the Board has passed a resolution to deduct 50 per cent of the sale proceeds\nas expenses of sale. It has to be borne in mind that sometimes the expenses\nof sale, which is conducted through public auction after a Gazette notification\nand wide publicity in newspapers, far exceed the actual amount recovered. In\nfact, the figures supplied in the counter affidavit show that in the year 2000-\n2001 and 2001-2002 the total cost incurred in holding the public auction\nD\nexceeded the amount recovered on the basis of the impugned resolution i.e.\n50 per cent of the sale proceeds and thus the Board has suffered a loss.\nE\n10. On overall consideration of the matter, we are of the opinion that\nthe appellant has failed to make out any case for interference by this Court\nin a Special Leave Petition filed under Article 136 of the Constitution. The\nappeal is accordingly dismissed with costs.\nB.B.B.\nAppeal dismissed.\n—\nた\n5.\nT\n!\n"}
