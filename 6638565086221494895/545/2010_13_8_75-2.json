The order dated\n27.01.2005 of the Supreme Court of Justice, Portugal mentions\nthat Article9.3 of the said Convention applies to the case of\nappellant-Abu Salem. As per Article 9.3, the State Parties,\nwhich do not make extradition conditional on the existence of\na treaty, shall recognize the offences themselves subject to the\nconditions provided by the law of the requested State. Article\n2 of the Convention defines the extraditable offences. The\nabove mentioned offences for which the extradition has not been\nF\nG\nH\n32 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2010] 13 (ADDL.) S.C.R.\nA specifically granted, also covered under the definition of\nextraditable offence, as mentioned in Article 2 of the said\nConvention.\nB\nC\n(r) The punishment provided for the offences, not included\nin the order of Supreme Court of Justice of Portugal, is lesser\nthan the punishment provided for the offences included in the\nsaid order of Extradition. The said offences are disclosed by\nthe facts, which were considered/proved for the purposes of\nextradition of appellant-Abu Salem from Portugal. It was further\nstated that the said offences are extradition offences, as defined\nunder Section 2(c)(ii) of the Extradition Act, 1962 and, thus, the\ntrial of appellant-Abu Salem for these offences is permissible\nunder Section 21(b) of the Extradition Act, 1962.\n(s) After framing of the charges on 18th March, 2006, the\nD Designated Court invited the views of the prosecution and the\ndefence about the further course of action for the trial of\nappellant-Abu Salem. The prosecution, Vide M.A. No. 144 of\n2006, submitted its views to the Designated Court, suggesting\ntherein that the trial of appellant-Abu Salem may be separated\nE in the same manner as was done by the Designated Court in\nrespect of absconding accused Mustafa Ahmed Dossa, upon\nhis arrest in March 2003, to avoid hardships to 123 accused\npersons whose trial had already been completed. It was further\nsubmitted by the prosecution that 33 accused persons were in\nF custody for the last about 12-13 years. The course of action as\nsuggested by the prosecution would not cause any prejudice\nto any accused, including appellant-Abu Salem and would also\navoid further delay in pronouncement of the judgment in the\ncase. The Designated Court, Mumbai, after hearing both the\nsides, by its order dated 13.06.2006 ordered that the trial of\nappellant-Abu Salem, co-accused Riyaz Ahmed Siddique and\nother absconding accused, mentioned in the common charge\nof criminal conspiracy, and jointly in progress along with the\nother co-accused mentioned in the said charge, stood\nseparated from the ongoing trial in progress. The Court further\nG\nH\nABU SALEM ABDUL QAYOOM ANSARI v. STATE OF 33\nMAHARASHTRA [P. SATHASIVAM, J.]\nordered that the said separated trial from that day (13.06.2006) A\nto be continued under No. BBC-1-B of 1993, in continuity with\nthe earlier joint case.\n6. These orders are under challenge in these appeals and\nwrit petition.\n7. Stand of the appellant-Abu Salem\nB\nD\nThe appellant has been extradited from Portugal for being\ntried in eight cases including the Bombay Bomb Blast Case\nNo. 1 of 1993 subject to certain conditions and the sovereign C\nassurance given by the Government of India to the Government\nof Portugal. It was his stand that the charges under Sections\n3(4), 5 and 6 of the TADA Act, Sections 4(b) and 5 of the\nExplosive Substances Act, Section 25 of the Arms Act and\nSection 9B of the Explosives Act (in R.C. No. 1(S/93)/CBI/STF\n(Bomb Blast Case) and charges under Section 120B, 387 and\n386 of the Indian Penal Code and under Section 5 of the TADA\n(in C.R. No. 144 of 1995) are in flagrant disobedience of the\nmandate of Section 21 of the Indian Extradition Act as well as\nthe solemn sovereign assurance of the Government of India,\nthe ministerial order of extradition of the appellant passed by\nthe Government of Portugal, the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals as well as the Supreme Court of Portugal.\nE\nF\n8. It is also his grievance that time and again the\nauthorities abused the process of criminal law by failing to file\nthe orders passed by Portugal Courts and by willfully and\ndeliberately violating the solemn sovereign assurance. It is his\ncategorical claim that the respondents are lowering the esteem\nof the nation by their deceitful behaviour in the field of\ninternational law, breaching the principle of speciality G\nestablished under the rule of international law and recognized\nby Section 21 of the Extradition Act after securing the\nextradition and gaining control of the appellant. The construction\nmade by the Designated Court is not acceptable and the\nappellant is being wrongly tried by the Designated Court in\nH\n34 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2010] 13 (ADDL.) S.C.R.\nA violation of the extradition decree and prayed for quashing of\nthe entire proceedings.\nB\nC\n9. Heard Mr. S. Pasbola, learned counsel for the appellant\nand Mr. Gopal Subramaniam, learned Solicitor General and\nMr. H.P. Rawal, learned Additional Solicitor General for the\nrespondents.\n10. The contention of the appellant that he is being tried\nfor the offences for which he has not been specifically\nextradited, has been rejected by way of the impugned order\non the ground that the extradition has been granted for the\noffences of higher degree and the additional offences for which\nhe is being tried are subsumed/included in the said higher\ndegree of offences and the trial would be permissible by virtue\nof clause (b) of Section 21 of the Extradition Act, 1962. As\nD pointed out earlier, apart from the appeals against the order\nof the Designated Court, the appellant has also preferred a writ\npetition seeking to invoke the extraordinary writ jurisdiction of\nthis Court on the ground that the trial for the offences for which\nhe has specifically not been extradited is violative of the\nE fundamental rights enshrined under Article 21 of the\nConstitution of India which guarantees a fair trial with due\nprocess of law.\nF\nG\nH\n11. The term 'extradition' denotes the process whereby\nunder a concluded treaty one State surrenders to any other\nState at its request, a person accused or convicted of a criminal\noffence committed against the laws of the requesting State,\nsuch requesting State being competent to try the alleged\noffender. Though extradition is granted in implementation of the\ninternational commitment of the State, the procedure to be\nfollowed by the courts in deciding, whether extradition should\nbe granted and on what terms, is determined by the municipal\nlaw of the land. Extradition is founded on the broad principle\nthat it is in the interest of civilised communities that criminals\nshould not go unpunished and on that account it is recognised\nas a part of the comity of nations that one State should\nABU SALEM ABDUL QAYOOM ANSARI v. STATE OF 35\nMAHARASHTRA [P. SATHASIVAM, J.]\nordinarily afford to another State assistance towards bringing A\noffenders to justice.\n12. With the tremendous increase in the facility of\ninternational transport and communication, extradition has\nassumed prominence since the advent of the present century.\nBecause of the negative attitude of the customary international\nlaw on the subject, extradition is by and large dealt with by\nbilateral treaties. These treaties, inasmuch as they affected, the\nrights of private citizens, required in their turn alterations in the\nlaws and statutes of the States which had concluded them. The\nestablished principle requires that without formal authority either\nby treaty or by statute, fugitive criminals would not be\nsurrendered nor would their surrender be requested.\n13. There is no general rule that all treaty rights and\nobligations lapse upon external changes of sovereignty over\nterritory nor is there any generally accepted principle favouring\nthe continuity of treaty relations. Treaties may be affected when\none State succeeds wholly or in part to the legal personality and\nterritory of another. The conditions under which the treaties of\nthe latter survive depend on many factors including the precise\nform and origin of the succession and the type of treaty\nconcerned. The emancipated territories on becoming\nindependent States may prefer to give general notice that they\nwere beginning with a \"clean slate\" so far as their future treaty\nrelations were concerned, or may give so-called тАЬpick and\nchoose\" notifications as to treaties as were formally applicable\nto it before achieving independence. The \"clean slateтАЭ doctrine\nwas ultimately adopted in the relevant provisions of the Vienna\nConvention of 1978. The sound general working rule which\nemerges is to look at the text of the relevant treaty and other\narrangements accompanying change of sovereignty and then\nascertain as to what was the intention of the State concerned\nas to the continuance or passing of any rights or obligations\nunder the treaty concerned. The question whether a State is in\na position to perform its treaty obligations is essentially a\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nI\nH.\n36 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2010] 13 (ADDL.) S.C.R.\nA political question which has to be determined keeping in view\nthe circumstances prevailing and accompanying the change of\nsovereignty.\nB\nC\n14. We have already referred to the factual details. Hence\nthere is no need to repeat the same once again. However, it\nis useful to advert the following information, namely, on\n04.11.1993, a single charge-sheet was filed in the Designated\nCourt against 189 accused persons, of which, 44 accused\npersons were shown absconding. The role attributed to Abu\nSalem in RCI(S) relating to the Bombay Bomb Blast case of\n1993 was that he was entrusted with the task of transportation\nof illegally smuggled arms and ammunitions and their storage\nand distribution to other co-accused. A portion of arms.\nsmuggled on 09.01.1993 were taken to village Sansrod, Distt.\nBharuch, Gujarat on the instructions of absconding accused\nD Anees Ibrahim Kaskar. Subsequently, the appellant took AK-\n56, ammunitions and hand grenades to Mumbai and distributed\namongst various co-accused. A Red Corner Notice bearing\nNo. A-103/3-1995 was issued through Interpol for the arrest of\nthe appellant. On 19.11.1993, further investigation was\nE transferred to C.B.I. The CBI registered case Crime No.\nRC1(S)/93/STF/BB. Consequently, further investigation was\nconducted by CBI and supplementary reports were filed under\nSection 173(8) of Cr.P.C. before the Designated Court on\nvarious dates. On 10.04.1995, the Designated Court, Mumbai,\nF after hearing the arguments of both sides, framed charges\nagainst the accused persons. The Court framed a common\ncharge of criminal conspiracy against all the accused persons\npresent before it, absconding accused and other unknown\naccused persons. The appellant has been named in the charge\nG as absconding accused. The charge included the offence of\nconspiracy also for the offences with which he has been\nsubstantively charged. By order dated 19.06.1995, before\ncommencing examination of witnesses, the Designated Court\ndirected that evidence to be adduced against the absconding.\naccused persons for the purpose of Section 299 of the Cr.P.C.\n╨Э\nABU SALEM ABDUL QAYOOM ANSARI v. STATE OF 37\nMAHARASHTRA [P. SATHASIVAM, J.]\nOn 18.09.2002, the appellant was detained by Portuguese A\nPolice, initially in a passport case and subsequently, in view of\nthe Red Corner Notice.\n15. In December, 2002, Government of India submitted\nrequest for extradition of the appellant in 9 criminal cases (three\ncases of CBI, two cases of Mumbai Police and four cases of\nDelhi Police).\nB\n16. Before going into the requisition made by the\nGovernment of India and the orders passed by the Government\nof Portugal as well as the Supreme Court of Justice, it is useful C\nto refer certain provisions of the Extradition Act, 1962. In order\nto codify the laws relating to the extradition to fugitive criminals,\nthe Parliament enacted the Extradition Act, 1962 which came\ninto force on 05.01.1963.
