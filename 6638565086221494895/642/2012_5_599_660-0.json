The CBI was\nasked to conduct the investigation. The CBI conducted\nthe investigation and filed charge-sheet against the army C\nofficers. The Magistrate granted opportunity to Army to\nexercise the option as to whether the competent\nauthority would prefer to try the case by way of court\nmartial by taking over the case under the provisions of\nSection 125 of the Army Act, 1950. The Army officers filed\nan application before the Magistrate that no prosecution\ncould be instituted except with the previous sanction of\nthe Central Government in view of the provisions of\nSection 7 of the Armed Forces J \u0026 K (Special Powers)\nAct, 1990 and, therefore, the proceedings be closed by\nE\nreturning the charge-sheet to the CBI. The Magistrate\ndismissed the application holding that it was for the trial\ncourt to find out whether the action complained of falls\nwithin the ambit of the discharge of official duty or not.\nThe Sessions Court dismissed the revision. It, however,\ndirected the Magistrate to give one more opportunity to\nthe Army officials for exercise of option under Section 125\nof the Army Act. The High Court affirmed the decisions\nof lower courts and held that the very objective of\nsanction is to enable the Army officers to perform their\nduties fearlessly by protecting them from vexatious,\nmalafide and false prosecution for the act done in\nperformance of their duties.\nIn the instant appeals, it was contended that Section\nF\nG\nI\n602 SUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2012] 5 S.C.R.\nA 7 of the Act 1990 provides that no prosecution, suit or\nlegal proceeding shall be instituted without prior sanction\nof the Central Government against any person in respect\nof anything done or purported to be done in exercise of\npowers conferred under the Act; that the prosecution\nB would be deemed to have instituted/initiated at the\nmoment the charge-sheet is filed and received by the\ncourt and such an acceptance/receipt is without\njurisdiction; and that the previous sanction of the\ncompetent authority is a pre-condition for the court in\nC taking the charge-sheet on record if the offence alleged\nto have been committed in discharge of official duty and\nsuch issue touches the jurisdiction of the court.\nD\nDisposing of the appeals, the Court\nHELD: 1.1. The Armed Forces J \u0026 K (Special Powers)\nAct, 1990 confers certain special powers upon members\nof the Armed Forces in the disturbed area in the State of\nJ \u0026 K. The disturbed area is defined and there is no\ndispute that the place where the incident occurred stood\nE notified under the Act 1990. Section 4 of the Act 1990\nconfers special powers on the officer of armed forces to\ntake measures, where he considers it necessary to do so,\nfor the maintenance of public order. However, he must\ngive due warning according to the circumstances and\neven fire upon or use force that may also result in\ncausing death against any person acting in\ncontravention of law and order in the disturbed area and\nprohibit the assembly of five or more persons or carrying\nof weapons etc. Such an officer has further been\nempowered to destroy any arms dump, arrest any\nperson without warrant who has committed a cognizable\noffence and enter and search without warrant any\npremises to make any arrest. Section 6 of the Act 1990\nrequires that such arrested person and seized property\nF\nG\nH\nGENERAL OFFICER COMMANDING v. CBI AND 603\nANR.\nbe handed over to the local police by such an officer. A\n[Para 9] [627-H; 628-A-D]\nB\nC\nD\n1.2. Section 7 of the Act 1990 provides for umbrella\nprotection to the Army personnel in respect of anything\ndone or purported to be done in exercise of powers\nconferred by the Act. The scheme of the Act requires that\nany prosecution, suit or legal proceeding instituted\nagainst any Army official working under the Act 1990 has\nto be subjected to stringent test before any such\nproceeding can be instituted. Section 7 is required to be\ninterpreted keeping the said objectives in mind. The\n'prosecution' means a criminal action before the court of\nlaw for the purpose of determining 'guilt' or 'innocence'\nof a person charged with a crime. Civil suit refers to a civil\naction instituted before a court of law for realisation of a\nright vested in a party by law. The phrase 'legal\nproceeding' connotes a term which means the\nproceedings in a court of justice to get a remedy which\nthe law permits to the person aggrieved. It includes any\nformal steps or measures employed therein. It is not\nsynonymous with the 'judicial proceedings'. Every\njudicial proceeding is a legal proceeding but not vice-\nversa, for the reason that there may be a 'legal\nproceeding' which may not be judicial at all, e.g. statutory\nremedies like assessment under Income Tax Act, Sales\nTax Act, arbitration proceedings etc. So, the ambit of F\nexpression 'legal proceedings' is much wider than\n'judicial proceedings'. The expression 'legal proceeding'\nis to be construed in its ordinary meaning but it is quite\ndistinguishable from the departmental and administrative\nproceedings. The terms used in Section 7 i.e. suit, G\nprosecution and legal proceedings are not inter-\nchangeable or convey the same meaning. The phrase\n'legal proceedings' is to be understood in the context of\nthe statutory provision applicable in a particular case, and\nconsidering the preceding words used therein. Legal H\nE\nC\n604 SUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2012] 5 S.C.R.\nA proceedings' means proceedings regulated or prescribed\nby law in which a judicial decision may be given; it\nmeans proceedings in a court of justice by which a party\npursues a remedy which a law provides, but does not\ninclude administrative and departmental proceedings.\nB The provision of Section 7 of the Act 1990 prohibits\ninstitution of legal proceedings against any Army\npersonnel without prior sanction of the Central\nGovernment. Therefore, chargesheet cannot be instituted\nwithout prior sanction of the Central Government. The\nuse of the words 'anything done' or 'purported to be\ndone' in exercise of powers conferred by the Act 1990 is\nvery wide in its scope and ambit and it consists of twin\ntest. Firstly, the act or omission complained of must have\nbeen done in the course of exercising powers conferred\nunder the Act, i.e., while carrying out the duty in the\ncourse of his service and secondly, once it is found to\nhave been performed in discharge of his official duty,\nthen the protection given under Section 7 must be\nconstrued liberally. Therefore, the provision contained\nunder Section 7 of the Act 1990 touches the very issue\nof jurisdiction of launching the prosecution.

INSTITUTION OF A CASE:\nThe meaning of the term 'institution' has to be\nGENERAL OFFICER COMMANDING v. CBI AND 605\nANR.\nascertained taking into consideration the scheme of the A\nAct/Statute applicable. The expression may mean filing/\npresentation or received or entertained by the court. Mere\npresentation of a complaint cannot be held to mean that\nthe Magistrate has taken the cognizance. Thus, the\nexpression \"Institution\" has to be understood in the B\ncontext of the scheme of the Act applicable in a particular\ncase. So far as the criminal proceedings are concerned,\n\"Institution\" does not mean filing; presenting or initiating\nthe proceedings, rather it means taking cognizance as\nper the provisions contained in the Cr.P.C.

The protection given under Section 197 Cr.P.C.\nis to protect responsible public servants against the\ninstitution of possibly vexatious criminal proceedings for\noffences alleged to have been committed by them while\nthey are acting or purporting to act as public servants.\nThe policy of the legislature is to afford adequate\nprotection to public servants to ensure that they are not\nprosecuted for anything done by them in the discharge H\nB\nC\nD\n606\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2012] 5 S.C.R.\nA of their official duties without reasonable cause, and if\nsanction is granted, to confer on the Government, if they\nchoose to exercise it, complete control of the\nprosecution. This protection has certain limits and is\navailable only when the alleged act done by the public\nservant is reasonably connected with the discharge of\nhis official duty and is not merely a cloak for doing the\nobjectionable act. Use of the expression \"official duty\"\nimplies that the act or omission must have been done by\nthe public servant in the course of his service and that it\nshould have been done in discharge of his duty. The\nsection does not extend its protective cover to every act\nor omission done by a public servant in service but\nrestricts its scope of operation to only those acts or\nomissions which are done by a public servant in\ndischarge of official duty. If on facts, therefore, it is prima\nfacie found that the act or omission for which the\naccused was charged had reasonable connection with\ndischarge of his duty, then it must be held to be official\nto which applicability of Section 197 Cr.P.C. cannot be\ndisputed. The question to examine as to whether the\nsanction is required or not under a statute has to be\nconsidered at the time of taking cognizance of the\noffence and not during enquiry or investigation. There is\na marked distinction in the stage of investigation and\nprosecution. The prosecution starts when the\ncognizance of offence is taken. The cognizance is taken\nof the offence and not of the offender. The sanction of\nthe appropriate authority is necessary to protect a public\nservant from unnecessary harassment or prosecution.\nSuch a protection is necessary as an assurance to an\nG honest and sincere officer to perform his public duty\nhonestly and to the best of his ability. The threat of\nprosecution demoralises the honest officer. However,\nperformance of public duty under colour of duty cannot\nbe camouflaged to commit a crime. The public duty may\nH provide such a public servant an opportunity to commit\nE\nF\nGENERAL OFFICER COMMANDING v. CBI AND 607\nANR.\nC\nD\ncrime and such issue is required to be examined by the A\nsanctioning authority or by the court. It is quite possible\nthat the official capacity may enable the pubic servant to\nfabricate the record or mis-appropriate public funds etc.\nSuch activities definitely cannot be integrally connected\nor inseparably inter-linked with the crime committed in B\nthe course of the same transaction. Thus, all acts done\nby a public servant in the purported discharge of his\nofficial duties cannot as a matter of course be brought\nunder the protective umbrella of requirement of sanction.\nIn fact, the issue of sanction becomes a question of\nparamount importance when a public servant is alleged\nto have acted beyond his authority or his acts\ncomplained of are in dereliction of the duty. In such an\neventuality, if the offence is alleged to have been\ncommitted by him while acting or purporting to act in\ndischarge of his official duty, grant of prior sanction\nbecomes imperative. It is so, for the reason that the power\nof the State is performed by an executive authority\nauthorised in this behalf in terms of the Rules of\nExecutive Business framed under Article 166 of the\nConstitution of India insofar as such a power has to be\nexercised in terms of Article 162 thereof. In broad and\nliteral sense `cognizance' means taking notice of an\noffence as required under Section 190 Cr.P.C.\n`Cognizance' indicates the point when the court first\ntakes judicial notice of an offence. The court not only\napplies its mind to the contents of the complaint/police\nreport, but also proceeds in the manner as indicated in\nthe subsequent provisions of Chapter XIV of the Cr.P.C.\n[Paras 22-24, 39] [634-E-H; 635-A-B; D-H, 636-A-E; 646-D-\nF]\nR.
