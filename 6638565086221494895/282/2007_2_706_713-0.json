THROUGH P.S. BERCHA\nFEBRUARY 15, 2007\n[DR. ARIJIT PASAYAT AND S.H. KAPADIA, JJ.]\nPenal Code-S.302 r/w s.34-Murder-Caused by inflicting knife\ninjuries-Appeal against conviction by Courts below-Held: Deceased's\nwidow, the eye-witness, gave vivid description about participation of accused\nright from the stage of FIR-Even after searching cross-examination, nothing\nto discredit her statement-Courts below justified in placing reliance upon\nher evidence—Plausible reason given for delay in lodging FIR, hence delay\ncondoned--No variance between medical evidence and ocular evidence as\nalleged-Conviction sustained.\nCriminal Trial:\n::\nWitness-Related or interested witness-Appreciation of evidence-\nDuty of Court-Held: No proposition in law that relatives be treated as\nuntruthful witnesses-But at the same time if relatives or interested witnesses\nare examined, Court has to analyse the evidence with deeper scrutiny.\nFIR-Delay in lodging—Effect of-Discussed.\nEvidence:\nMedical evidence and ocular evidence-Variance between-Effect of—\nHeld: Oral evidence has to get primacy-Medical evidence is basically\nopinionative-Medical evidence can be used to repel the testimony of eye-\nwitnesses only if it is conclusive as to rule out even the possibility of the eye-\nwitness's version being true.\nAccording to the prosecution, PW1 heard alarm raised by her husband\nand thereafter found Appellant and four other accused grappling with him.\nAppellant allegedly went to his house and brought a knife whereafter he and\na co-accused 'P' stabbed the husband of PW1 with several blows of knife\nresulting in his death. Trial Court convicted Appellant and 'P' under Section\n706\nT\nSHYAM v. STATE OF M.P. THROUGH P.S. BERCHA\n707\n302 r/w 34 IPC. The other three accused were acquitted. On appeal, High A\nCourt acquitted the said 'P', but upheld the conviction of Appellant, though\nunder S.304 Part-II IPC. Hence the present appeal challenging the conviction\nof Appellant.\nDismissing the appeal, the Court\nB\nC\nHELD: 1. In the case of appellant, PW1, the eye witness has right from\nthe stage of the First Information Report, given a vivid description about the\nparticipation from the beginning, the manner in which he went to his house\nand brought the knife and he assaulted and caused injuries to the deceased.\nThe evidence of Dr. H.L. Arya (PW-3) and his autopsy report clearly recorded\nfour external injuries on the body of the deceased. The testimony of this\nwitness has been subjected to searching cross-examination, but nothing has\nbeen brought on record to discredit the statement of PW-1. What has been\nsuggested is that the deceased was drunken and that there was grappling\nbetween the two in which the deceased sustained injuries. As seen from the\ninjuries recorded in post mortem report, first injury has been sustained in D\nthe lumbar region, second on the shoulder, third in the inguinal region and\nthe fourth on the left forearm. It appears incredible that in grappling, a person\nwould sustain injuries on places where it would be difficult for his hand to\nreach. It is also beyond comprehension that in such grappling with a knife in\nthe hand of the deceased, the other party, namely the accused, would escape\nunscathed. Thus the prosecution has fully succeeded in showing that it was\non account of the injuries inflicted by Appellant that the death occurred. [Para\n8] [711-B, C, D, E\nE\n(I)\nF\n2.1. There is no proposition in law that relatives are to be treated as\nuntruthful witnesses. On the contrary, reason has to be shown when a plea of\npartiality is raised to show that the witnesses had reason to shield the actual\nculprit and falsely implicate the accused. No evidence has been led in this\nregard. So far as the delay in lodging the FIR is concerned, the witnesses\nhave clearly stated that after seeing the deceased in an injured condition\nimmediate effort was to get him hospitalized and get him treated. There cannot\nbe any generalization that whenever there is a delay in lodging the FIR, the G\nprosecution case becomes suspect. Whether delay is so long as to throw a\ncloud of suspicion on the seeds of the prosecution case, would depend upon\nthe facts of each case. Even a long delay can be condoned if the witnesses\nhave no motive of implicating the accused and have given a plausible reason\nas to why the report was lodged belatedly. In the instant case, this has been\nT\nH\n708\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 2 S.C.R.\nA done. It is to be noted that though there was cross-examination at length no\ninfirmity was noticed in their evidence. Therefore, the trial Court and the\nHigh Court were right in relying on the evidence PW-1. [Para 9]\nC\n[711-E, G, H; 712-A|\n2.2. In some cases persons may not like to come and depose as witnesses\nB and in some other cases the prosecution may carry the impression that their\nevidence would not help it as there is likelihood of partisan approach so far\nas one of the parties is concerned. In such a case mere non-examination would\nnot affect the prosecution version. But at the same time if the relatives or\ninterested witnesses are examined, the Court has a duty to analyse the evidence\nwith deeper scrutiny and then come to a conclusion as to whether it has a\nring of truth or there is reason for holding that the evidence was biased.\nWhenever a plea is taken that the witness is partisan or had any hostility\ntowards the accused, foundation for the same has to be laid. If the materials\nshow that there is partisan approach, as indicated above, the Court has to\nanalyse the evidence with care and caution. Additionally, the accused persons\nD always have the option of examining the left out persons as defence witnesses.\n[Para 11] [712-C, D, E]\n3.1. So far as the alleged variance between medical evidence and ocular\nevidence is concerned it is trite law that oral evidence has to get primacy and\nmedical evidence is basically opinionative. It is only when the medical evidence\nE specifically rules out the injury as claimed to have been inflicted as per the\noral testimony, then only in a given case the Court has to draw adverse\ninference. [Para 10] [712-B, C]\n3.2. It has now become axiomatic that medical evidence can be used to\nrepel the testimony of eyewitness only if it is so conclusive as to rule out\nF\neven the possibility of the eyewitness's version to be true. A doctor usually\nconfronted with such questions regarding different possibilities or probabilities\nof causing those injuries or post-mortem features which he noticed in the\nmedical report may express his views one way or the other depending upon\nthe manner the question was asked. But the answers given by the witness to\nG such questions need not become the last word on such possibilities. After all\nhe gives only his opinion regarding such questions. But to discard the\ntestimony of an eyewitness simply on the strength of such opinion expressed\nby the medical witness is not conducive to the administration of criminal\njustice. [Para 12] [712-F, G, H; 713-A]\nH\n3.3. In this case it has been categorically held that there is no variance.\nSHYAM v. STATE OF M.P. THROUGH P.S. BERCHA [PASAYAT, J.] 709\nThat being so, even the hypothetical plea is also applicable. [Para 13] [713-B] A\nState of U.P. v. Krishna Gopal and Anr., AIR (1988) SC 2154 and\nRamanand Yadav v. Prabhu Nath Jha \u0026 Ors., [2003] 12 SCC 606, relied on.\nCRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Criminal Appeal No. 215 of\n2007.\nFrom the Judgment and final Order dated 4.1.2006 of the High Court of\nMadhya Pradesh (Indore Bench) in Criminal Appeal No. 616/1996.\nNiraj Sharma and Vikrant Singh for the Appellant.\nVibha Datta Makhija for the Respondent.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nDR. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. 1. Leave granted.\nB\nC\nD\n2. Challenge in this appeal is to the order passed by a Division Bench\nof the Madhya Pradesh High Court, Indore Bench. On the basis of the\naccusations that appellant and four others were responsible for the homicidal\ndeath of one Kailash (hereinafter referred to as the 'deceased') on 27.10.1995,\nthe accused persons faced trial. The learned First Additional Sessions Judge,\nShajapur, found two of the accused persons i.e. Prakash and appellant herein E\nShyam to be guilty of offence punishable under Section 302 read with Section\n34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short the 'IPC'). Each was sentenced\nto undergo imprisonment for life and to pay a fine of Rs.1,000/- each with\ndefault stipulation. The other three were acquitted. The appellant and co-\naccused Prakash preferred an appeal before the High Court which was\nF\ndismissed by the impugned order, so far as appellant is concerned. Prakash\nwas directed to be acquitted.\n3. Prosecution version as unfolded during trial is as follows:\nOn 27.10.1995 wife of the deceased Bhagwantibai (PW-1) was in her\nG\nhouse, when at about 11.00 o' Clock, she heard the alarm raised by her\nhusband. When she came out, she witnessed that the accused persons and\nthe acquitted co-accused were grappling with him. Just then, appellant Shyam\nwent to his house and brought a knife while accused Babloo @ Prakash\nexhorted them to kill him. Acquitted co-accused Dhapubai and Kirshnabai\nH\nB\n710\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n13\n[2007] 2 S.C.R.\nA then caught the deceased and Shyam and Prakash administered several blows\nof knife causing injuries in various part of the body of deceased Kailash.\nBhagwantibai (PW-1) raised an alarm and informed Mohanlal, Babu and\nRamchandra about the incident. Kailash was carried on a cot to the hospital,\nbut he succumbed to the injuries. Report of the incident Ex.P/1 was lodged\nat the police station by Bhagwantibai (PW-1), which was recorded by B.L.\nMeena, Station House Officer (PW-8) and an offence was registered against\nthe accused. During investigation, inquest was held and inquest report Ex.P/\n6 was prepared. The body was forwarded for post-mortem examination vide\nrequisition Ex.P/3. Spot map Ex.P/10 was prepared and samples of blood\nstained and simple earth were obtained vide Ex.P/11. A pair of chappals from\nC the spot was seized under memo Ex.P/12. During investigation, accused persons\nwere arrested and the disclosures made by them were recorded and in pursuance\nthereof, knife, vest (baniyan) from Shyam and a knife and kurta, pyajamas\nfrom Prakash were seized. The seized articles were sent to the Forensic\nScience Laboratory for analysis and charge sheet was filed against the\nappellants and co-accused.\nD\nE\n4. On consideration of evidence on record, appellant and Prakash were\nconvicted and others were acquitted. The convicted accused persons preferred\nan appeal before the High Court.\n5. The primary plank of the argument of the appellant before the High\nCourt was that the medical evidence was at variance with the so called eye\nwitnesses' version. The High Court did not accept the stand. The High Court\nfound that actually there was no variance between the medical evidence and\nthe ocular evidence. The High Court found no substance in the said plea of\nthe accused appellant. It, however, found that accusations were not established\nF so far as the accused Prakash was concerned. Accordingly his conviction\nwas set aside and he was acquitted. However, the High Court found that the\nconviction under Section 302 IPC was not appropriate, the proper provision\napplicable would be Section 304 Part II IPC so far as present appellant is\nconcerned. Custodial sentence of 7 years was imposed. Accordingly the\nappeal was partially allowed.\nG\nH\n6. Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that since on the very\nsame evidence three persons have been acquitted, it would not be proper to\nconvict accused appellant on the self-same evidence, that too of a relative i.e.\ndeceased's widow. There was also delay in lodging the FIR. Alternatively, it\n\u003e\n+\nSHYAM v. STATE OF M.P. THROUGH P.S. BERCHA [PASAYAT...]\n711\nwas submitted that the High Court was not justified in holding that the A\nappellant was responsible for the death of the deceased and/or that he had\nknowledge that the act committed by him would result in death.\n7. Learned counsel for the State on the other hand supported the\njudgment of the High Court.\nB\nC\n8. Coming to the case of appellant Shyam, the eye witness has right\nfrom the stage of the first information report, given a vivid description about\nthe participation from the beginning, the manner in which he went to his\nhouse and brought the knife and he assaulted and caused injuries to Kailash.\nThe evidence of Dr. H.L. Arya (PW-3) and his autopsy report clearly recorded\nfour external injuries on the body of the deceased Kailash. The testimony of\nthis witness has been subjected to searching cross-examination, but nothing\nhas been brought on record to discredit the statement of Bhagwantibai (PW-\n1). What has been suggested is that the deceased was drunken and that there\nwas grappling between the two in which the deceased sustained injuries. As\nseen from the injuries recorded in post mortem report, first injury has been D\nsustained in the lumbar region, second on the shoulder, third in the inguinal\nregion and the fourth on the left forearm. It appears incredible that in grappling,\na person would sustain injuries on places where it would be difficult for his\nhand to reach. It is also beyond comprehension that in such grappling with\na knife in the hand of the deceased, the other party, namely the accused,\nwould escape unscathed. We have recorded the submission only to discard\nit. Thus the prosecution has fully succeeded in showing that it was on\naccount of the injuries inflicted by accused Shyam that death of Kailash\noccurred.\nE\n9. There is no proposition in law that relatives are to be treated as F\nuntruthful witnesses. On the contrary, reason has to be shown when a plea\nof partiality is raised to show that the witnesses had reason to shield the\nactual culprit and falsely implicate the accused. No evidence has been led in\nthis regard. So far as the delay in lodging the FIR is concerned, the witnesses\nhave clearly stated that after seeing the deceased in an injured condition\nimmediate effort was to get him hospitalized and get him treated. There cannot G\nbe any generalization that whenever there is a delay in lodging the FIR, the\nprosecution case becomes suspect. Whether delay is so long as to throw a\ncloud of suspicion on the seeds of the prosecution case, would depend upon\nthe facts of each case. Even a long delay can be condoned if the witnesses\nH\n712\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 2 S.C.R.\nA have no motive of implicating the accused and have given a plausible reason\nas to why the report was lodged belatedly. In the instant case, this has been\ndone. It is to be noted that though there was cross-examination at length no\ninfirmity was noticed in their evidence. Therefore, the trial Court and the High\nCourt were right in relying on the evidence PW-1.\nB\nC\n10. So far as the alleged variance between medical evidence and ocular\nevidence is concerned it is trite law that oral evidence has to get primacy and\nmedical evidence is basically opinionative. It is only when the medical evidence\nspecifically rules out the injury as claimed to have been inflicted as per the\noral testimony, then only in a given case the Court has to draw adverse\ninference.\n· 11. In some cases persons may not like to come and depose as witnesses\nand in some other cases the prosecution may carry the impression that their\nevidence would not help it as there is likelihood of partisan approach so far\nas one of the parties is concerned. In such a case mere non-examination\nD would not affect the prosecution version. But at the same time if the relatives\nor interested witnesses are examined, the Court has a duty to analyse the\nevidence with deeper scrutiny and then come to a conclusion as to whether\nit has a ring of truth or there is reason for holding that the evidence was\nbiased. Whenever a plea is taken that the witness is partisan or had any\nhostility towards the accused, foundation for the same has to be laid. If the\nE materials show that there is partisan approach, as indicated above, the Court\nF\nhas to analyse the evidence with care and caution. Additionally, the accused\npersons always have the option of examining the left out persons as defence\nwitnesses.\n12. Over dependence on such opinion evidence, even if the witness is\nan expert in the field, to checkmate the direct testimony given by an eyewitness\nis not a safe modus adoptable in criminal cases. It has now become axiomatic\nthat medical evidence can be used to repel the testimony of eyewitness only.\nif it is so conclusive as to rule out even the possibility of the eyewitness's\nversion to be true. A doctor usually confronted with such questions regarding\nG different possibilities or probabilities of causing those injuries or post-mortem\nfeatures which he noticed in the medical report may express his views one\nway or the other depending upon the manner the question was asked. But\nthe answers given by the witness to such questions need not become the last\nword on such possibilities. After all he gives only his opinion regarding such\nH\n:\nSHYAM v. STATE OF M.P.

But to discard the testimony of an eyewitness simply on the A\nstrength of such opinion expressed by the medical witness is not conducive\nto the administration of criminal justice.

In this case it has been categorically held that there is no variance. B\nThat being so, even the hypothetical plea is also applicable.\n14. In the aforesaid circumstances the judgment of the High Court does\nnot suffer from any infirmity.\nB.B.B.\n15. The appeal is dismissed.\nC\nAppeal dismissed.\n"}
