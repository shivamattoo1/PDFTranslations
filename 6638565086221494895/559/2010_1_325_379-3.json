The provision under Article 16(4)\n- conceived in the interest of certain sections of society.\nshould be balanced against the guarantee of equality\nenshrined in Clause (1) of Article 16 which is a guarantee\nheld out to every citizen and to the entire society. If is B\nrelevant to point out that Dr. Ambedkar himself\ncontemplated reservation being \"confined to a minority of\nseats\" (see his speech in Constituent Assembly, set out in\npara 28). No. other member of the Constituent Assembly\nsuggested otherwise. It is thus, clear that reservation of a C\nmajority of seats were never envisaged by the found\nFathers. Nor are we satisfied that the present context\nrequires us to depart from that concept.\"\n34. In PGI MER vs. Faculty Association (supra in para 32\nD\nthe same principle was reiterated as under:-\n\"32. Article 14, 15 and 16 including Articles 16(4), 16(4-\nA) must be applied in such a manner so that the balance\nis struck in the matter of appointments by creating\nreasonable opportunities for the reserved classes and also E\nfor the other members of the community who do not belong\nto reserved classes. Such view has been indicated in the\nConstitution Bench decisions of this Court in Balaji case,\nDevendasan case and Sabharwal case. Even in Indra\nSawhney case the same view has been held by indicating F\nthat only a limited reservation not exceeding 50% is\npermissible. It is to be appreciated that Article 15(4) is an\nenabling provision like Article 16(4) and the reservation\nunder either provision should not exceed legitimate limits.\nIn making reservations for the backward classes, the State\ncannot ignore the fundamental rights of the rest of the\ncitizens. The special provision under Article 15(4 [sic 16(4)]\nmust therefore strike a balance between several relevant\nconsiderations and proceed objectively. In this connection\nreference may be made to the decisions of this Court in\nG\nH☐\nН\nA\n00\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\n356 SUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2010] 1 S.C.R.\nState of AP vs. USV Balram and A Rajendran v. Union\nof India, it has been indicated in Indra Sawhney case that\nClause (4) of Article 16 is not in the nature of an exception\nto Clauses (1) and (2) of Article 16 but an instance of\nclassification permitted by Clause (1). It has also been\nindicated in the said decision that Clause (4) of Article 16\ndoes not cover the entire field covered by Clauses (1) and\n(2) of Article 16. In Indra Sawhney case this Court has also\nindicated that in the interests of the Backward clauses of\ncitizens, the State cannot reserve all the appointments\nunder the State or even a majority of them. The doctrine\nof equality of opportunity in Clause (1) of Article 16 is to\nbe reconciled in favour of backward clauses under Clause\n(4) of Article 16 in such a manner that the latter while\nserving the cause of backward classes shall not\nunreasonably encroach upon the field of equality.\"\n35. These observations make it abundantly clear that the\nreservations should not be so excessive as to render the\nFundamental Right under Article 16(1) of the Constitution\nmeaningless. In Indra Sawhney (supra), this Court has observed\nas under:-\n\"In our opinion, however, the result of application of carry-\nforward rule, in whatever manner it is operated, shall not\nresult in breach of 50% rule.\"\n36. Therefore, utmost care has to be taken that the 50%\nmaximum limit placed on reservation in any particular year by\nthis Court in Indra Sawhney case (supra) must be maintained.\nIt must further be ensured that in making reservations for the\nmembers of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, the\nG maintenance of the efficiency of administration is not impaired.\n37. It is in this context, we have to examine the issue as\nto whether the relaxation in fee and upper age limit of five years\nin the category of OBC candidates would fall within the\nH definition of \"reservation\" to exclude the candidates from open\nJITENDER KUMAR SINGH \u0026 ANR. v. STATE OF U.P. 357\n\u0026 ORS. [SURINDER SINGH NIJJAR, J.]\ncompetition on the seats meant for the General Category A\nCandidates. Taking note of the submissions, the Division Bench\nhas concluded by considering questions 1, 2 and 3 that\nconcession in respect of age, fee etc. are provisions pertaining\nto eligibility of a candidate to find out as to whether he can\nappear in the competitive test or not and by itself do not provide B\nany indicia of open competition. According to the Division.\nBench, the competition would start only at the stage when all\nthe persons who fulfill the requisite eligibility conditions, namely,\nqualification, age etc. are short-listed. We are of the opinion\nthat the conclusion reached by the Division Bench on the issue\nof concessions and relaxations cannot be said to be erroneous.\nC\nD\nE\n38. The selection procedure provided the minimum age\nfor recruitment as 21 years and the maximum age of 25 years\non the cut off date. Relaxation of age for various categories of\ncandidates in accordance with the Government Orders issued\nfrom time to time was also admissible. This included five years'\nrelaxation in age to Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribes, Other\nBackward Classes and dependents of Freedom Fighters.\nRelaxation of age was also provided in case of Ex-servicemen.\nThe period of service rendered in Army would be reduced for\ncomputing the age of the Ex-Army personnel. After deducting\nthe period of service they had rendered in the Army, they would\nbe deemed eligible. These were mere eligibility conditions for\nbeing permitted to participate in the selection process.\nThereafter, the candidates had to appear in a Preliminary F\nWritten Test. This consisted of 300 maximum marks and the\ncandidates were required to secure 50% or more marks to\nparticipate in the further selection process. Thereafter, the\ncandidates had to undergo physical test consisting of 100\nmarks. Again a candidate was required to secure at least 50% G\nor more marks. It is not disputed before us that the standard of\nselection in the Preliminary Written Test and the Physical Test\nwas common to all the candidates. In other words, the standard\nwas not lowered in case of the candidates belonging to the\nreserved category. The Preliminary Written Test and the H\nC\n358 SUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2010] 1 S.C.R.\nA Physical Test were in the nature of qualifying examinations to\nappear in the Main Written Test. The marks obtained in the\nPreliminary Written Examination and the Physical Test were not\nto be included for determination of final merits. It was only\ncandidates who qualified in the preliminary written test and the\nB physical test that became eligible to appear in the main written\ntest which consisted of 600 marks. As noticed earlier, this had\ntwo papers- General Hindi, General Knowledge and Mental\nAptitude Test. A candidate who secured 40% or above would\nbe declared successful in the written test. Thereafter, the\ncandidates were to appear for interview of 75 marks. The final\nmerit list would be prepared on the basis of merit secured in\nthe main written test and the interview. Candidates appearing\nin the merit list, so prepared, would be declared selected. It is\ncommon ground that more than 50000 candidates appeared\nin the preliminary written test. Upon declaration of the result on\n22.9.2000, only 3,325 candidates were found successful.\nThereafter, the physical test which was conducted from\n29.10.2000 to 6.11.2000 reduced the successful candidates\nto 1454. It was these 1454 candidates who sat in the main\nwritten test held on 29.4.2001. Upon declaration of result, 1178\ncandidates were declared successful.\nD\nE\nThe candidates who were successful in the written test\nwere subjected to an interview between 18.6.2001 to 1.7.2001.\nThe final result published on 6.7.2001 declared only 1006\nF candidates successful.\nG\nH\n39. In view of the aforesaid facts, we are of the considered\nopinion that the submissions of the appellants that relaxation\nin fee or age would deprive the candidates belonging to the\nreserved category of an opportunity to compete against the\nGeneral Category Candidates is without any foundation. It is\nto be noticed that the reserved category candidates have not\nbeen given any advantage in the selection process. All the\ncandidates had to appear in the same written test and face the\nsame interview. It is therefore quite apparent that the\nJITENDER KUMAR SINGH \u0026 ANR. v. STATE OF U.P. 359\n\u0026 ORS. [SURINDER SINGH NIJJAR, J.]\nB\nC\nconcession in fee and age relaxation only enabled certain A\ncandidates belonging to the reserved category to fall within the\nzone of consideration. The concession in age did not in any\nmanner tilt the balance in favour of the reserved category\ncandidates, in the preparation of final merit/select list. It is\npermissible for the State in view of Articles 14, 15, 16 and 38\nof the Constitution of India to make suitable provisions in law\nto eradicate the disadvantages of candidates belonging to\nsocially and educationally backward classes. Reservations are\na mode to achieve the equality of opportunity guaranteed under\nArticle 16 (1) of the Constitution of India. Concessions and\nrelaxations in fee or age provided to the reserved category\ncandidates to enable them to compete and seek benefit of\nreservation, is merely an aid to reservation. The concessions\nand relaxations place the candidates at par with General\nCategory candidates. It is only thereafter the merit of the\ncandidates is to be determined without any further concessions\nin favour of the reserved category candidates. It has been\nrecognized by this Court in the case of Indra Sawhney (supra)\nthat larger concept of reservation would include incidental and\nancillary provisions with a view to make the main provision of\nreservation effective. In the case of Indra Sawhney (supra), it\nhas been observed as under:-\nD\nE\n\"743. The question then arises whether clause (4) of Article\n16 is exhaustive of the topic of reservations in favour of\nbackward classes. Before we answer this question, it is F\nwell to examine the meaning and content of the expression\n\"reservation\". Its meaning has to be ascertained having\nregard to the context in which it occurs. The relevant words\nare “any provision for the reservation of appointments or\nposts\". The question is whether the said words G\ncontemplate only one form of provision namely reservation\nsimplicitor, or do they take in other forms of special\nprovisions like preferences, concessions and exemptions.\nIn our opinion, reservation is the highest form of special\nprovision, while preference, concession and exemption are\nН\nA\nB\nC\nD\n360 SUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2010] 1 S.C.R.\nlesser forms. The constitutional scheme and context of\nArticle 16 (4) induces us to take the view that larger\nconcept of reservations takes within its sweep all\nsupplemental and ancillary provisions and relaxations,\n· consistent no doubt with the requirement of maintenance\nof efficiency of administration-the admonition of Article\n335. The several concessions, exemptions and other\nmeasures issued by the Railway Administration and\nnoticed in Karamchari Sangh are instances of\nsupplementary, incidental and ancillary provisions made\nwith a view to make the main provision of reservation\neffective i.e., to ensure that the members of the reserved\nclass fully avail of the provision for reservation in their\nfavour.....\"\n\"\n40. In our opinion, these observations are a complete\nanswer to the submissions made by Mr. L.N. Rao and Dr. Rajiv\nDhawan on behalf of the petitioners.\n41. We are further of the considered opinion that the\nreliance placed by Mr.Rao and Dr.Dhawan on the case of\nE K.L.Narsimhan (supra) is misplaced. Learned Sr. Counsel had\nrelied on the following observations:-\nF\nG\nH\n\"5......Only one who does get admission or appointment by\nvirtue of relaxation of eligibility criteria should be treated\nas reserved candidate.\"\n41. The aforesaid lines cannot be read divorced from the\nentire paragraph which is as under:-\n\"5.It was decided that no relaxation in respect of\nqualifications or experience would be recommended by\nScrutiny Committee for any of the applicants including\ncandidates belonging to Dalits and Tribes. In furtherance\nthereof, the faculty posts would be reserved without\nmentioning the specialty; if the Dalit and Tribe candidates\nwere available and found suitable, they would be treated\nJITENDER KUMAR SINGH \u0026 ANR. v. STATE OF U.P. 361\n\u0026 ORS. [SURINDER SINGH NIJJAR, J.]\nas reserved candidates. If no Dalit and Tribe candidate A\nwas found available, the post would be filled from general\ncandidates; otherwise the reserved post would be carried\nforward to the next year/advertisement. It is settled law that\nif a Dalit or Tribe candidate gets selected for admission\nto a course or appointment to a post on the basis of merit B\nas general candidate, he should not be treated as reserved\ncandidate. Only one who does get admission or\nappointment by virtue of relaxation of eligibility criteria\nshould be treated as reserved candidate.\"\n42. These observations make it clear that if a reserved\ncategory candidate gets selected on the basis of merit, he\ncannot be treated as a reserved candidate. In the present case,\nthe concessions availed of by the reserved category candidates\nin age relaxation and fee concession had no relevance to the\ndetermination of the inter se merit on the basis of the final\nwritten test and interview. The ratio of the aforesaid judgment\nin fact permits reserved category candidates to be included in\nthe General Category Candidates on the basis of merit.\nC\nD\n43. Even otherwise, merely quoting the isolated E\nobservations in a judgment cannot be treated as a precedent\nde hors the facts and circumstances in which the aforesaid\nobservation was made. Considering a similar proposition in the\ncase of Union of India \u0026 Ors. vs. Dhanwanti Devi and others,\n1996(6) SCC 44, this Court observed as follows:-\n\"9 It is not everything said by a Judge while giving\njudgment that constitutes a precedent. The only thing in a\nJudge's decision binding a party is the principle upon\nwhich the case is decided and for this reason it is important\nto analyse a decision and isolate from it the ratio\ndecidendi. A decision is only an authority for what it\nactually decides. What is of the essence in a decision is\nits ratio and not every observation found therein nor what\nlogically follows from the various observations made in the\njudgment. It would, therefore, be not profitable to extract a\nF\nG\nH\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\n362 SUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2010] 1 S.C.R.\nsentence here and there from the judgment and to build\nupon it because the essence of the decision is its ratio and\nnot every observation found therein. It is only the principle\nlaid down in the judgment that is binding law under Article\n141 of the Constitution.\"\n44. In the case of State of Orissa \u0026 Ors. vs. Md. Illiyas\nreported in 2006(1) SCC 275, the Supreme Court reiterates\nthe law, as follows:-\n“12 Reliance on the decision without looking into\nthe factual background of the case before it, is clearly\nimpermissible. A decision is a precedent on its own facts.\nEach case presents its own features. It is not everything\nsaid by a Judge while giving judgment that constitutes a\nprecedent. A decision is an authority for what it actually\ndecides. What is of the essence in a decision is its ratio\nand not every observation found therein nor what logically\nflows from the various observations made in the judgment.\nThe enunciation of the reason or principle on which a\nquestion before a court has been decided is alone binding\nas a precedent.\nA case is a precedent and binding for what it explicitly\ndecides and no more. The words used by Judges in their\njudgments are not to be read as if they are words in an\nAct of Parliament.\"\n45. We may now examine the ratio in Narasimhan case\n(supra) keeping in view the aforesaid principles. On\n16.11.1990 an advertisement was issued by Post Graduate\nInstitute of Medical Education and Research (hereinafter\nG referred to as 'PGI') relating to recruitment to the post of\nAssistant Professor; out of 12 posts, 8 was reserved for\nScheduled Caste and 4 posts were reserved for Scheduled\nTribes. Since all the available posts were sought to be filled on\nthe basis of reservation, the same were challenged in two writ\nH petitions in the Punjab and Haryana High Court, Chandigarh.\nJITENDER KUMAR SINGH \u0026 ANR. v. STATE OF U.P. 363\n\u0026 ORS. [SURINDER SINGH NIJJAR, J.]\nD\nBoth the writ petitions were allowed by the learned Single Judge. A\nIt was held that the post of Assistant Professor in various\ndisciplines is a single post cadre; reservation for Scheduled\nCaste and Scheduled Tribes would amount to 100%\nreservation; accordingly, it is unconstitutional. The said writ\npetition pertained to admission to Doctoral courses and Ph.D. B\nprogramme. This was also allowed by the learned Single Judge\non the ground that admission to the aforesaid courses on the\nbasis of reservation, undermines efficiency and is detrimental\nto excellence, rendering it unconstitutional. Appeals against the\njudgements of the learned Single Judge were dismissed by the C\nHigh Court. Therefore, three appeals had been filed in this\nCourt. Two issues involved therein were (a) whether reservation\nin appointment to the post of Assistant Professors in various\ndisciplines in the PGI is violative of Article 14 and 16(1) of the\nConstitution of India; and (b) whether there could be reservation\nin admission to the Doctoral courses and Ph.D. programmes.\nA number of posts of Assistant Professor in diverse disciplines\nhad been advertised. It was not in dispute that the post of\nAssistant Professor in each Department was a single post\ncadre, but carried the same scale of pay and grade in all\ndisciplines. It was also not disputed that the posts in different\nspecialties/super-specialties prescribed distinct and different\nqualifications. The posts were also not transferable from one\nspecialty to another, however, the PGI had clubbed all the posts\nof Assistant Professor for the purpose of reservation in view\nof the fact that they are in the same pay scale and have same\ndesignation. The High Court had allowed the writ petition by\nrelying on judgement of this Court in Chakradhar Paswan (Dr.)\nvs. State of Bihar (1998) 2 SCC 214. The ratio in the aforesaid\njudgement was distinguished on the basis of the judgement in\nUnion of India vs. Madhav, (1997)2 SCC 332. The aforesaid\njudgement was reviewed by a larger Bench of five Judges of\nthis Court in the case of Post Graduate Institute of Medical\nEducation and Research, Chandigarh vs. Faculty Association\nand others (1998) 4 SCC 1. On behalf of the review petitioners\nit was contended that judgement in Narasimhan case (supra) H\n111\nE\nF\nG\n364 SUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2010] 1 S.C.R.\nA cannot be supported as in Madhav case (supra) the ratio in\nthe decision of Arati Ray Chaudhary vs. Union of India 1974\n(1) SCC 87 was wrongly appreciated and the ratio was wrongly\nstated. On the other hand, it was submitted by the learned\nSolicitor General that the judgement in Madav case (supra)\nB indicated the correct principle by giving very cogent reasons.\nTherefore, no interference is called for against the decision in\nMadhav case (supra) and the other decisions rendered by\nfollowing the decision. Upon consideration of the rival\nsubmissions, it was observed as follows:-\nC\n0\nE\nF\n0\nH\n\"29. In Madhav case in support of the view that even in\nrespect of single post cadre reservation can be made for\nthe backward classes by rotation of roster, the Constitution\nBench decision in Arati Ray Choudhury case has been\nrelied on. We have already indicated that in Arati case the\nConstitution Bench did not lay down that in single post\ncadre, reservation is possible with the aid of roster point.\nThe Court in Arati case considered the applicability of\nroster point in the context of plurality of posts and in that\ncontext the rotation of roster was upheld by the Constitution\nBench. The Constitution Bench in Arati case had made it\nquite clear by relying on the earlier decisions of the\nConstitution Bench in Balaji case and Devadasan case\nthat 100% reservation was not permissible and in no case\nreservation beyond 50% could be made. Even the circular\non the basis of which appointment was made in Arati Ray\nChoudhury case was amended in accordance with the\ndecision in Devadasan case. Therefore, the very premise\nthat the Constitution Bench in Arati case has upheld\nreservation in a single post cadre is erroneous and such\nerroneous assumption in Madhav case has been on\naccount of misreading of the ratio in Arati Ray Choudhury\n: case. It may be indicated that the latter decision of the\nConstitution Bench in R.K. Sabharwal case has also\n*proceeded on the footing that reservation in roster can\noperate provided in the cadre there is plurality of post. It\n"}
