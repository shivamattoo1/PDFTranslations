Leave granted.\nC\nD\nE\nF\n2. Appellants call in question legality of the judgment rendered by a\nG\nDivision Bench of the Calcutta High Court dismissing the appeal filed by the\nappellants, but modifying the sentence. Appellants faced trial for commission\nof offences punishable under Section 304B read with Section 34 of the Indian\nPenal Code, 1860 (in short the 'IPC') and Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry\nProhibition Act, 1961 (in short the ‘DP Act').\nH\n122\nA\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n3. The prosecution version in brief is as follows:\n[2007] 4 S.C.R.\n4. Rupali, sister of informant Dilip Patra (PW-1) was married to appellant\nBiswajit Halder-appellant no.1 on 6th March, 1992. Appellants Dulal Chandra\nHalder and Maya Halder are the parents of Biswajit. At the time of marriage\ndowry i.e. of Rs.43,000/-, gold ornaments and the household articles were\nB given to the appellants, but they were not satisfied with the dowry items.\nC\nD\nSince marriage Rupali was put under pressure to bring one colour television,\nEnglish Khat and VIP bag for her father-in-law and other relatives. Rupali time\nand again had reported about the persistent demand of the appellants to her\nfather and brothers. Rupali's brother (PW-1) on different occasions requested\nthe appellants not to harass Rupali for non-payment of those items. On 27th\nJuly, 1992 Rupali committed suicide at the house of the appellants by consuming\npoison and after getting the sad news from his relatives, PW-1, who being\na member of Indian Armed Forces was posted at Punjab, came to his native\nvillage and lodged the FIR on 6th August, 1992.\n5. On receipt of the FIR, police started investigation and on completion\nof investigation, charge sheet was submitted against the appellants for their\ntrial.\n6. The learned Additional Sessions Judge, after framing charges against\nall the three appellants examined 17 witnesses in all, including PW-1, relatives\nE of the victim woman, two doctors and the investigating officer.\nF\n7. On examination of the prosecution evidence and after hearing both\nthe prosecution and defence, the learned Additional Sessions Judge found\nsufficient materials against all the appellants to convict them for offences\npunishable under Sections 304B/34 and 498A/34 of the IPC and also under\nSections 3 and 4 of the DP Act. Learned trial Judge, after convicting the\nappellants, sentenced them to suffer rigorous imprisonment for ten years each\nfor the offence punishable under Section 304B of the IPC. The appellants were\nsentenced to suffer rigorous imprisonment for one year each and to pay a fine\nof Rs.1,000/-for the offence punishable under Section 498A of the IPC. In\nG default of the payment rigorous imprisonment for three months was stipulated.\nLearned trial Judge also sentenced the appellants to suffer rigorous\nimprisonment for five years each and to pay a fine of Rs.15,000/- each under\nSection 3(1) of the DP Act and that apart, the appellants were also sentenced\nto suffer rigorous imprisonment for six months each and to pay a fine of\nRs.10,000/- each for the offence under Section 4 of the DP Act with default\nH\n\"\nر\nBISWAJIT HALDER @ BABU HALDER v. STATE OF WEST BENGAL [PASAYAT, J.] 123\nstipulation. Learned trial Judge directed that all the sentences were to run A\nconcurrently.\n8. Questioning correctness of the conviction and the sentences imposed\nappellants preferred appeal before the Calcutta High Court which held that the\nappellants were to suffer the minimum sentence as prescribed under Section\n304B IPC, but there was no necessity for separately sentencing the appellants B\non either Section 498A IPC or Sections 3 and 4 of the DP Act.\n9. In support of the appeal, learned counsel for the appellants submitted\nthat there was no finding that there was demand for dowry and/or that\ndeceased was subjected to cruelty or harassment, or that harassment was for\nC\nor in connection with the demand of dowry.\n10. Learned counsel for the respondent on the other hand submitted\nthat Section 304B IPC has to be read in the context of Section 113B of the\nIndian Evidence Act, 1872 (in short 'Evidence Act'). The court could presume\nthe death of the deceased to be dowry death and it was open to the Court Ꭰ .\nto presume further that the appellants being members of the matrimonial home\nat the relevant were responsible for the dowry death of the deceased. Reliance\nwas placed on a decision of this Court in Smt. Shanti and Anr. v. State of\nHaryana, AIR (1991) SC 1226.\n11. The basic ingredients to attract the provisions of Section 304B are\nas follows:-\n(1) The death of a woman should be caused by burns or fatal injury\nor otherwise than under normal circumstances;\nE\n(2) Such death should have occurred within seven years of her\nmarriage;\nF\n(3) She must have been subjected to cruelty or harassment by her\nhusband or any relative of her husband; and\n(4) Such cruelty or harassment should be for or in connection with\ndemand for dowry.\nG\n12. Alongside insertion of Section 304B in IPC, legislature also introduced\nSection 113B of Evidence Act, which lays down when the question as to\nwhether a person has committed the dowry death of a woman and it is shown\nthat soon before her death such woman had been subjected by such person\nH\nH\n124\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 4 S.C.R.\nA to cruelty or harassment for, or in connection with, any demand for dowry,\nthe court shall presume that such person had caused the dowry death.\nB\nC\nᎠ\n13. Explanation appended to Section 113 B lays down that \"for the\npurpose of this section 'dowry death shall have the same meaning as in\nSection 304 B of IPC”.\n14. If Section 304 B IPC is read together with Section 113 B of the\nEvidence Act, a comprehensive picture emerges that if a married woman dies\nin an unnatural circumstances at her matrimonial home within 7 years from her\nmarriage and there are allegations of cruelty or harassment upon such married\nwoman for or in connection with demand of dowry by the husband or\nrelatives of the husband, the case would squarely come under \"dowry death\"\nand there shall be a presumption against the husband and the relatives.\n15. In this case we find that there is practically no evidence to show\nthat there was any cruelty or harassment for or in connection with the demand\nof dowry. There is also no finding in that regard. This deficiency in evidence\nproves fatal for the prosecution case. Even otherwise mere evidence of cruelty\nand harassment is not sufficient to bring in application of Section 304B IPC.\nIt has to be shown in addition that such cruelty or harassment was for or in\nconnection with the demand for dowry. (See: Kanchy Ramchander v. State\nof A.P., [1996] SCC (Crl.) 31). Since the prosecution failed to prove that aspect,\nE the conviction as recorded cannot be maintained.\n16.
