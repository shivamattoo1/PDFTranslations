The workmen approached the Contract\nLabour Court seeking abolition of contract labour system\nand their absorption as regular employees. On 26th July\n2004, the Central Government issued a Notification\nabolishing the contract labour system. Airports Authority\nof India (AAI) which had come into force challenged the\nD notification. The High Court held that the present\nproceedings could not be proceeded with till the matter\nwas resolved by the High Powered Committee (HPC) and\nas such the matter went to the HPC and the Notification\nwas not given effect to. Meanwhile, the said 136 workers\nE were removed from service in the year 2003 as the\ncontract of TDI Company came to an end and a new\ncontractor 'SH' came in its place. Thereafter, from 4th\nApril 2006, a new private entity, Delhi International Airport\nPrivate Limited (DIAL) took over the Airports (Domestic\nF and International). 136 workers filed a writ petition praying\nfor their absorption in service as regular employees and\nfor implementation of the Notification dated 26th July,\n2004. The Single Judge of the High Court dismissed the\nwrit petition holding that the establishment of AAI is no\nG longer in existence and has changed and as such, the\nNotification dated 26th July, 2004 cannot be applied to the\nnew entity DIAL. and the appropriate government shall\nhave to issue a fresh Notification. Indira Gandhi\nInternational Airport TDI Karamchari Union and Union of\nH\nDELHI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT PVT. LTD. v.\nUNION OF INDIA \u0026 ORS.\n1117\nIndia filed separate LPA's. During pendency of the LPA's A\nthe Chief Labour Commissioner, Government of India\npassed an order holding that the appropriate government\nfor DIAL is the Central Government and the documents\nand file relating to DIAL were sent to the Central\nGovernment. DIAL filed a writ petition. AAI filed another B\nwrit petition challenging the said notification. The Division\nBench of the High Court held that in relation to airport, it\nis the Central Government which is the appropriate\ngovernment for the purpose of CLRAA; and that DIAL is\nequally bound by the Notification dated 26th July, 2004 C\nissued by the Central Government. The review petition\nfiled by the Union of India was also disposed of.\nAggrieved, DIAL, AAI and the Indira Gandhi International\nAirport TDI Karamchari Union filed the instant appeals.\nThe question which arose for consideration in these\nappeals are as to who is the appropriate government for\nDIAL under the CLRAA and ID Act; that whether the\nNotification dated 26th July, 2004 issued by the Central\nGovernment under Section 10 (1) of the CLRAA\nprohibiting employment of contract labour of trolley\nretrievals in the establishment of the Airport Authority of\nIndia at the Indira Gandhi International Airport and\nDomestic Airport. at Delhi would be applicable to DAIL\nwhich only came into existence on 4th April, 2006.\nDisposing of the appeals, the Court\nHELD: 1.1. Section 2(a) of the Contract Labour\n(Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970 makes it clear that\nthe Central Government would be the \"appropriate\ngovernment\" under CLRAA for any establishment for\nwhom the Central Government is the \"appropriate\ngovernment” under the Industrial Disputes Act. Section\n2(a) of the ID Act indicates that the Central Government\nis the \"appropriate authority\" in three relevant situations\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n1118 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2011] 13 (ADDL.) S.C.R.\nA wherein both Airport Authority of India (AAI) and the air\ntransport service have been specifically incorporated\nitself. Thus, if Delhi International Airport Private Limited\n(DIAL) industry is carried on under the authority of the\nCentral Government, the dispute in question can be said\nB to concern AAI or if the dispute in question can be said\nto concern air transport service, then the Central\nGovernment is the appropriate authority both for ID Act\nand CLRAA. It may be pertinent to properly comprehend\nthe relevant statute. [Paras 33 and 34] [1145-F-H; 1146-\nC A-D-E]\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n1.2. The AAI Act was constituted for the better\nadministration and cohesive management of airports and\ncivil enclaves whereas air transport services are operated\nor are intended to be operated and of all aeronautical\ncommunication stations for the purpose of establishing\nor assisting in the establishment of airports and for\nmatters connected therewith or incidental thereto. [Para\n35] [1146-F-G]\n1.3. It is clear from Section 12A that AAI may in public\ninterest or in the interest of a better management of the\nairport, make a lease of the premises of the airport to\ncarry out some of its functions under Section 12 as the\nAuthority may deem fit. Detailed functions of the Authority\nhave been enumerated in Section 12. Out of those\nfunctions under Section 12A, some functions can be\ndelegated on lease in the public interest or in the interest\nof better control and management of the airports.\nConsequently, in pursuance of the agreement with DIAL,\nsome functions of AAI were leased out to DIAL. DIAL\nderives its authority from AAI and AAI derives its authority\nfrom the powers given by the Central Government. In the\nimpugned judgment, the Division Bench clearly held that\nAAl works \"under the authority\" of the Central\nGovernment. [Paras 38, 39 and 40] [1147-H; 1148-A-B-E]\nDELHI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT PVT. LTD. v. 1119\nUNION OF INDIA \u0026 ORS.\n1.4. A close reading of the objects and reasons\nindicates that the Central Government under Section 12A\nof the AAI Act has retained the power to give directions\nin the public interest or in the interest of better\nmanagement to lease the premises of the airport to carry\nout some of its functions under Section 12A, as the\nauthority may deem fit. Some of its (AAI's) functions have\nbeen leased out to DIAL. This has been done under\nSection 12A(2) with the previous approval of the Central\nGovernment. On proper scrutiny of the provisions of the\nAAI Act, it is abundantly clear that the Central Government\nhas control over AAI and AAI has control over DIAL. [Para\n42] [1150-E-F]\nA\nB\nC\nD\n1.5. The AAI Act was passed by the Central\nGovernment \"to provide for the constitution of the\nAirports Authority of India' which was in turn charged with\nthe \"better administration and cohesive management of\nairports.\" Preamble to Section 12A of the AAI Act allows\nAAI to contract with third parties to perform some of AAI's\nfunctions (in the public interest or in the interest of better\nmanagement of airports). It was this proviso which E\nallowed AAI to assign some of its functions to DIAL\nthrough Operation, Management, Development and\nAgreement (OMDA), responsibility for trolley collection\nservices at the Indira Gandhi International Airport and the\ndomestic airport. [Para 45] [1151-E-F]\n1.6. In the impugned judgment, the Division Bench\ncorrectly held that \"the provisions of the AAI Act show\nthat there is extensive control of the Central Government\nover the functioning of AAI.\" Section 12A reveals control\nof the Central Government on AAI. AAI has to obtain\napproval from the Central Government before delegating\nany of its functions to third parties, such as DIAL. This\nclearly indicates that the Central Government has\ncomplete control over AAI. Sections 2, 6 and 10 of the AAI\nF\nG\nH\n1120 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2011] 13 (ADDL.) S.C.R.\nA are examples of governmental reservations of authority.\nThe Central Government retains its statutory control over\nAAI. In the impugned judgment, the High Court correctly\ncame to the conclusion that \"the authority of the Central\nGovernment is conferred by the statute itself”. [Para 50]\nB [1153-A-C]\nс\n1.7. In case the Central Government had never\ngranted permission, pursuant to Section 12A of the AAI\nAct, DIAL would not be able to carry out functions at the\nDelhi airports. The entire functioning of DIAL is fully\ndependent on the grant of permission by the Central\nGovernment. The undertakings need not be government\nundertakings to have had authority conferred upon them.\nBut the word \"government” clearly modifies “company.”\nHowever, it cannot modify “undertaking,\" for the phrase\nD \"government/any undertaking”. Thus, it would seem that\nany “undertaking”- even private undertakings, like DIAL\nmay function \"under the authority\" of the Central\nGovernment. Whether or not they do it, “a question of fact\nwhich has to be ascertained on the facts and in the\nE circumstances of each case.\" In the facts and\ncircumstances of these cases, it is abundantly clear that\nDIAL operates under the authority of the Central\nGovernment. [Paras 52, 53 and 54] [1153-G-H; 1154-D-E]\nLL\n\"\nF\n1.8. The functions and powers of DIAL in relation to\nthe Delhi airports are traceable to Section 12A of the AAI\nAct. Without Central Government's permission, AAI could\nnot have delegated any power to DIAL. In other words,\nthe functioning of DIAL at the Delhi airports itself was fully\ndependent on the approval of the Central Government.\nDIAL could not have received its contract with AAI\nwithout the Central Government's approval. That being\nthe case, by a plain reading of the phrase it seems that\n\"DIAL functions under the authority of the Central\nGovernment\". [Para 55] [1154-F-H]\nG\nH\nDELHI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT PVT. LTD. v. 1121\nUNION OF INDIA \u0026 ORS.\n1.9. DIAL does not explain how having the State A\nGovernment as the appropriate government - the only\nalternative under CLRAA and ID Act - would be any more\nconducive to privatization. The Central Government does\nnot impede privatization any more than the State\nGovernment; after all, it was the Central Government that B\nsought to encourage privatization through the AAI Act by\nincorporating Section 12A in the Act. [Para 56] [1155-B-\nc]\n1.10. In case AAI and DIAL act under the authority of\ndifferent governments it would bring about absurd\nresults: AAI could simply circumvent potential Central\nGovernment orders by delegating various functions to\nthird parties, such as DIAL. AAI would need to obtain\nCentral Government approval prior to making such a\ndelegation under Section 12A of the AAI Act, but it\nnevertheless seems unlikely that the Central Government\nwould intend to maintain authority over AAI's actions,\nwhile allowing actions performed by other entities on\nbehalf of AAI, such as DIAL, to be carried out under the\nauthority of the State Government. DIAL made no\nsuggestions as to why the Central Government might\nhave intended such a result while drafting the AAI Act and\nCLRAA, and there is, therefore, little justification for\ncoming to such a conclusion. [Para 57] [1155-D-E]\n1.11. DIAL expressly assumed the \"rights and\nobligations associated with the operation and\nmanagement of the airport\" through OMDA. While\nSection 12A of the AAI Act only notes that the \"powers\nand functions\" of AAI will be transferred to its lessors, it\nis \"inconceivable that by virtue of Section 12A the\npowers and functions of AAI will stand transferred and\nnot the corresponding obligations.\" If it was the\n\"obligation\" of AAI to follow valid directions of the Central\nGovernment by virtue of its status as an enumerated\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n1122 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2011] 13 (ADDL.) S.C.R.\nA industry, and if DIAL has admittedly assumed those same\nobligations through OMDA, then DIAL is presumably also\nobligated to follow such directions. Again, a contrary\ninterpretation would allow AAI to circumvent the Central\nGovernment's exercise of authority over its work merely\nB by contracting it out to third parties. It is abundantly clear\nthat the Central Government is the appropriate\ngovernment qua DIAL and consequently the said\nNotification of 26th July, 2004 is equally applicable to\nDIAL. Under the ID Act (and therefore, CLRAA), the third\nC situation in which the Central Government is the\n\"appropriate Government\" is \"in relation to industrial\ndisputes concerning air transport services.\" [Paras 58\nand 59] [1155-G-H; 1156-A-C]\nD\n1.12. Trolley retrievers themselves are not physically\ntransporting anything by air. However, it is entirely\npossible that the drafters of the AAI Act did not intend to\nrestrict the coverage of this provision merely to pilots,\nstewardesses, and others engaged in the actual, physical\ntransport of people and objects, as DIAL would have\nE liked the Court to believe. Trolleys at airports relate to air\ntransportation- just as they relate to \"a single flight or a\nseries of flights.\" [Para 60] [1156-E]\nF\nG\nH\n1.13. At the time of amendment when private airline\noperators had started functioning and as “air transport\nservice\" they included all airline operators, private on\npublic and the said industry was included as ar-\nenumerated industry. Thus, the \"air transport service'\nconcerns airline operators only. DIAL is not engaged ir-\nthe business of operating an airline for carrying\npassengers and goods by air through flights. In fact, AA-\nis also not involved in this activity and Section 12 of the\nAAI Act which lists out the functions of AAI does no\ninclude the function of carrying people and goods\nthrough air by flights operated by it. As such, when AA-\nDELHI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT PVT. LTD. v.\nUNION OF INDIA \u0026 ORS.\n1123\nes not perform such function then there is no question A\ntransfer of such functions to DIAL. [Paras 62 and 64]\n156-H; 1157-C]\n1.14. It is the duty of the authority to provide all air\ninsport services at the airport, and if it is not the duty\nthe authority to carry passengers and goods by air\nrough flights, then by the appellants own logic, air\nansport service must mean more than the mere\narriage of passengers and goods by air through flights.\nit did not, then there would be no reason that \"air\nansport service” would be listed as a \"duty of the\nuthority” under Section 12(2). This Section clearly\n▪dicates that it is the duty of the Authority to provide “air\nansport service\", such duty does not mean that the\nuthority provides such services itself. AAI is responsible\nnder the AAI Act for providing air transport service\nould not necessarily mean that DIAL also does so.\naras 65 and 66] [1157-E-F]\nB\nC\nD\nF\n1.15. In the instant case, under Section 12A of the AAI\n\u003et all functions were given to DIAL except watch and E\nard function, air traffic service and civil enclaves. From\ne provisions of OMDA, it was clear that all functions of\n■l barring reserved activities and all land except certain\nirved out assets were given to DIAL. DIAL admitted that\nAl transferred to it all functions except those related to\natch and ward, air traffic service and civil enclaves,\n-ne of which could be considered as \"air transport\nrvice\". That being the case, AAI must have transferred\nduty to provide “air transport service\" to DIAL and the\nintral Government must, therefore, be the appropriate\nvernment for DIAL under the CLRAA and ID Act. [Para\n68] [1157-G-H; 1158-A-B]\nG\n1.16. Section 10(1) of the CLRAA permits the\nppropriate government\" to \"prohibit employment of\nntract labour in any process, operation or other work H\n1124 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2011] 13 (ADDL.) S.C.R.\nA in any establishment. The Central Government's 26th\nJuly, 2004 notification clearly forbade the \"AAI\nestablishment\" from employing trolley retrievers as\ncontract labour. [Para 69] [1158-D]\nB\nC\n1.17. The provision s. 291)(e) makes it clear, the\ndefinition of “establishment\" focuses either on (1) Place;\nor (2) Offices or departments of the Government or a\nlocal authority. The 26th July, 2004 notification must,\ntherefore, have been directed at one of these types of\nestablishments. [Para 72] [1159-C]\n1.18. On the one hand, AAI clearly cannot be\nconsidered a local authority as it is charged with\nmanaging airports throughout India. On the other hand,\nAAI also cannot be considered an \"office or department\nD of the Government\". The AAI Act makes clear that AAI\nmust, in certain circumstances, obtain approval from the\nCentral Government, thereby implying that AAI is not\nitself the Central Government. Therefore, \"establishment\"\nin this case cannot refer to \"any office or department of\nE the Government or a local authority\", it must refer to a\n\"place where any industry, trade, business, manufacture\nor occupation is carried on\". The Division Bench in the\nimpugned judgment held that the establishment for the\npurposes of the CLRAA is a place where the industrial,\ntrade or business activity is carried on then it necessarily\nfollows in the context of the instant case that it is the\nDelhi Airports which constitute the establishment of AAI\nand in turn the establishment of DIAL. There could be\nmultiple establishments at the airport. That being the\ncase, the Division Bench's assertion that the\nestablishment of AAI is in turn the establishment of DIAL\nmust be justified. [Paras 73, 75] [1159-D-G; 1160-B]\nF\nG\n1.19.
