The power or discretion of the\nGovernment in the matter of grant of largesse including\naward of jobs, contracts, quotas, licences, etc. must be\nconfined and structured by rational, relevant and non-\ndiscriminatory standard or norm and if the Government C\ndeparts from such standard or norm in any particular\ncase or cases, the action of the Government would be\nliable to be struck down, unless it can be shown by the\nGovernment that the departure was not arbitrary, but was\nbased on some valid principle which in itself was not\nirrational, unreasonable or discriminatory.\"\n(emphasis supplied)\n25. In Kasturi Lal Lakshmi Reddy v. State of J And K\n(1980) 4 SCC 1, Bhagwati J. speaking for the Court observed:\n\"Where any governmental action fails to satisfy the test of\nreasonableness and public interest discussed above and\nis found to be wanting in the quality of reasonableness or\nlacking in the element of public interest, it would be liable\nto be struck down as invalid. It must follow as a necessary\ncorollary from this proposition that the Government cannot\nact in a manner which would benefit a private party at the\ncost of the State; such an action would be both\nunreasonable and contrary to public interest. The\nGovernment, therefore, cannot, for example, give a\ncontract or sell or lease out its property for a consideration\nless than the highest that can be obtained for it, unless\nof course there are other considerations which render it\nreasonable and in public interest to do so. Such\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\n☐ G\nH_\n128\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2011] 5 S.C.R.\nconsiderations may be that some directive principle is\nsought to be advanced or implemented or that the contract\nor the property is given not with a view to earning revenue\nbut for the purpose of carrying out a welfare scheme for\nthe benefit of a particular group or section of people\ndeserving it or that the person who has offered a higher\nconsideration is not otherwise fit to be given the contract\nor the property. We have referred to these considerations\nonly illustratively, for there may be an infinite variety of\nconsiderations which may have to be taken into account\nby the Government in formulating its policies and it is on\na total evaluation of various considerations which have\nweighed with the Government in taking a particular action,\nthat the court would have to decide whether the action of\nthe Government is reasonable and in public interest. But\none basic principle which must guide the court in arriving\nat its determination on this question is that there is always\na presumption that the governmental action is reasonable\nand in public interest and it is for the party challenging its\nvalidity to show that it is wanting in reasonableness or is\nnot informed with public interest. This burden is a heavy\none and it has to be discharged to the satisfaction of the\ncourt by proper and adequate material. The court cannot\nlightly assume that the action taken by the Government is\nunreasonable or without public interest because, as we\nsaid above, there are a large number of policy\nconsiderations which must necessarily weigh with the\nGovernment in taking action and therefore the court would\nnot strike down governmental action as invalid on this\nground, unless it is clearly satisfied that the action is\nunreasonable or not in public interest. But where it is so\nsatisfied, it would be the plainest duty of the court under\nthe Constitution to invalidate the governmental action.\nThis is one of the most important functions of the court\nand also one of the most essential for preservation of the\nrule of law. It is imperative in a democracy governed by\nthe rule of law that governmental action must be kept\nAKHIL BHARTIYA UPBHOKTA CONGRESS v. STATE 129\nOF MADHYA PRADESH AND ORS. [G.S. SINGHVI, J.]\nwithin the limits of the law and if there is any A\ntransgression, the court must be ready to condemn it. It\nis a matter of historical experience that there is a tendency\nin every Government to assume more and more powers\nand since it is not an uncommon phenomenon in some\ncountries that the legislative check is getting diluted, it is B\nleft to the court as the only other reviewing authority under\nthe Constitution to be increasingly vigilant to ensure\nobservance with the rule of law and in this task, the court\nmust not flinch or falter. It may be pointed out that this ground\nof invalidity, namely, that the governmental action is C\nunreasonable or lacking in the quality of public interest, is\ndifferent from that of mala fides though it may, in a given\ncase, furnish evidence of mala fides.\"\n(emphasis supplied)\nD\n26. In Common Cause, A Registered Society v. Union\nof India (1996) 6 SCC 530 the two Judge Bench considered\nthe legality of discretionary powers exercised by the then\nMinister of State for Petroleum and Natural Gas in the matter\nof allotment of petrol pumps and gas agencies. While declaring E\nthat allotments made by the Minister were wholly arbitrary,\nnepotistic and motivated by extraneous considerations the\nCourt said:\n-\n\"The Government today - in a welfare State provides\nlarge number of benefits to the citizens. It distributes wealth\nin the form of allotment of plots, houses, petrol pumps, gas\nagencies, mineral leases, contracts, quotas and licences\netc. Government distributes largesses in various forms. A\nMinister who is the executive head of the department\nconcerned distributes these benefits and largesses. He is\nelected by the people and is elevated to a position where\nhe holds a trust on behalf of the people. He has to deal\nwith the people's property in a fair and just manner. He\ncannot commit breach of the trust reposed in him by the\npeople.\"\nF\nG\nH\n130\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2011] 5 S.C.R.\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\n27. The Court also referred to the reasons recorded in the\norders passed by the Minister for award of dealership of petrol\npumps and gas agencies and observed:\n\"24. While Article 14 permits a reasonable\nclassification having a rational nexus to the objective\nsought to be achieved, it does not permit the power to pick\nand choose arbitrarily out of several persons falling in the\nsame category. A transparent and objective criteria/\nprocedure has to be evolved so that the choice among the\nmembers belonging to the same class or category is\nbased on reason, fair play and non-arbitrariness. It is\nessential to lay down as a matter of policy as to how\npreferences would be assigned between two persons\nfalling in the same category. If there are two eminent\nsportsmen in distress and only one petrol pump is\navailable, there should be clear, transparent and objective\ncriteria/procedure to indicate who out of the two is to be\npreferred. Lack of transparency in the system promotes\nnepotism and arbitrariness. It is absolutely essential that\nthe entire system should be transparent right from the\nstage of calling for the applications up to the stage of\npassing the orders of allotment.\"\n.28. In Shrilekha Vidyarthi v. State of U.P. (1991) 1 SCC\n212, the Court unequivocally rejected the argument based on\nthe theory of absolute discretion of the administrative authorities\nand immunity of their action from judicial review and observed:\n\".... We have no doubt that the Constitution does not\nenvisage or permit unfairness or unreasonableness in\nState actions in any sphere of its activity contrary to the\nprofessed ideals in the Preamble. In our opinion, it would\nbe alien to the Constitutional Scheme to accept the\nargument of exclusion of Article 14 in contractual matters.\nThe scope and permissible grounds of judicial review in\nsuch matters and the relief which may be available are\nI\nAKHIL BHARTIYA UPBHOKTA CONGRESS v. STATE 131\nOF MADHYA PRADESH AND ORS. [G.S. SINGHVI, J.]\ndifferent matters but that does not justify the view of its total A\nexclusion. This is more so when the modern trend is also\nto examine the unreasonableness of a term in such\ncontracts where the bargaining power is unequal so that\nthese are not negotiated contracts but standard form\ncontracts between unequals....\nEven assuming that it is necessary to import the\nconcept of presence of some public element in a State\naction to attract Article 14 and permit judicial review, we\nhave no hesitation in saying that the ultimate impact of all\nactions of the State or a public body being undoubtedly\non public interest, the requisite public element for this\npurpose is present also in contractual matters. We,\ntherefore, find it difficult and unrealistic to exclude the State\nactions in contractual matters, after the contract has been\nmade, from the purview of judicial review to test its validity\non the anvil of Article 14.\nB\nC\nD\nF\nIt can no longer be doubted at this point of time that\nArticle of the Constitution of India applies also to matters\nof governmental policy and if the policy or any action of the E\nGovernment, even in contractual matters, fails to satisfy the\ntest of reasonableness, it would be unconstitutional. (See\nRamana Dayaram Shetty v. The International Airport\nAuthority of India [(1979) 3 SCR 1014: AIR 1979 SC\n1628] and Kasturi Lal Lakshmi Reddy v. State of Jammu\nand Kashmir [(1980) 3 SCR 1338: AIR 1980 SC 1992],\nIn Col. A.S. Sangwan v. Union of India [(1980 (Supp)\nSCC 559 AIR 1981 SC 1545], while the discretion to\nchange the policy in exercise of the executive power, when\nnot trammelledly the statute or rule, was held to be wide,\nit was emphasised as imperative and implicit in Article 14\nof the Constitution that a change in policy must be made\nfairly and should not give the impression that it was so\ndone arbitrarily or by any ulterior criteria. The wide sweep\nof Article 14 and the requirement of every State action\nG\nH\nA\nB\n0\n132 SUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2011] 5 S.C.R.\nqualifying for its validity on this touch-stone, irrespective of\nthe field of activity of the State, has long been settled. Later\ndecisions of this Court have reinforced the foundation of\nthis tenet and it would be sufficient to refer only to two\nrecent decisions of this Court for this purpose.\"\n29. Similarly, in L.I.C. of India v. Consumer Education \u0026\nResearch Centre (1995) 5 SCC 482, the Court negatived the\nargument that exercise of executive power of the State was\nimmune from judicial review and observed:\nс \".... Every action of the public authority or the person acting\nin public interest or its acts give rise to public element,\nshould be guided by public interest. It is the exercise of\nthe public power or action hedged with public element\nbecomes open to challenge. If it is shown that the exercise\nof the power is arbitrary, unjust and unfair it should be no\nanswer for the State, its instrumentality, public authority or\nperson whose acts have the insignia of public element to\nsay that their actions are in the field of private law and they\nare free to prescribe any conditions or limitations in their\nactions as private citizens, similicitor, do in the field of\nprivate law. Its actions must be based on some rational\nand relevant principles. It must not be guided by traditional\nor irrelevant considerations.......\nE\nய\nF\nLL\nG\nH\nThis Court has rejected the contention of an instrumentality\nor the State that its action is in the private law field and\nwould be immune from satisfying the tests laid under\nArticle 14. The dichotomy between public law and private\nlaw rights and remedies, though may not be obliterated by\nany straight jacket formula, it would depend upon the\nfactual matrix. The adjudication of the dispute arising out\nof a contract would, therefore, depend upon facts and\ncircumstances in a given case. The distinction between\npublic law remedy and private law filed cannot be\ndemarcated with precision. Each case will be examined\non its facts and circumstances to find out the nature of the\nAKHIL BHARTIYA UPBHOKTA CONGRESS v. STATE 133\nOF MADHYA PRADESH AND ORS. [G.S. SINGHVI, J.]\nactivity, scope and nature of the controversy. The A\ndistinction between public law and private law remedy has\nnow become too thin and practicably obliterated.......\nIn the sphere of contractual relations the State, its\ninstrumentality, public authorities or those whose acts bear\ninsignia of public element, action to public duty or\nobligation are enjoined to act in a manner i.e. fair, just and\nequitable, after taking objectively all the relevant options\ninto consideration and in a manner that is reasonable,\nrelevant and germane to effectuate the purpose for public\ngood and in general public interest and it must not take\nany irrelevant or irrational factors into consideration or\narbitrary in its decision. Duty to act fairly is part of fair\nprocedure envisaged under Articles 14 and 21. Every\nactivity of the public authority or those under public duty or\nobligation must be informed by reason and guided by the\npublic interest.\"\n30. In New India Public School v. HUDA (1996) 5 SCC\n510, this Court approved the judgment of the Division Bench\nof the Punjab and Haryana High Court in Seven Seas\nEducational Society v. HUDA AIR 1996 (P\u0026H) 229: (1996)\n113 PLR 17, whereby allotment of land in favour of the\nappellants was quashed and observed:\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nA reading thereof, in particular Section 15(3) read with\nRegulation 3(c) does indicate that there are several modes\nof disposal of the property acquired by HUDA for public\npurpose. One of the modes of transfer of property as\nindicated in Sub-section (3) of Section 15 read with sub-\nregulation (c) of Regulation 5 is public auction, allotment\nor otherwise. When public authority discharges its public\nduty the word \"otherwise\" would be construed to be\nconsistent with the public purpose and clear and\nunequivocal guidelines or rules are necessary and not at\nthe whim and fancy of the public authorities or under their\ngarb or cloak for any extraneous consideration. It would H\nG.\n134\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2011] 5 S.C.R.\nA\n00\nB\nс\nD\ndepend upon the nature of the scheme and object of public\npurpose sought to be achieved. In all cases relevant\ncriterion should be pre-determined by specific rules or\nregulations and published for the public. Therefore, the\npublic authorities are required to make necessary specific\nregulations or valid guidelines to exercise their\ndiscretionary powers, otherwise, the salutory procedure\nwould be by public auction. The Division Bench, therefore,\nhas rightly pointed out that in the absence of such statutory\nregulations exercise of discretionary power to allot sites\nto private institutions or persons was not correct in law.\"\n31. What needs to be emphasized is that the State and/\nor its agencies/instrumentalities cannot give largesse to any\nperson according to the sweet will and whims of the political\nentities and/or officers of the State. Every action/decision of the\nState and/or its agencies/instrumentalities to give largesse or\nconfer benefit must be founded on a sound, transparent,\ndiscernible and well defined policy, which shall be made known\nto the public by publication in the Official Gazette and other\nrecognized modes of publicity and such policy must be\nimplemented/executed by adopting a non-discriminatory and\nnon-arbitrary method irrespective of the class or category of\npersons proposed to be benefitted by the policy. The\ndistribution of largesse like allotment of land, grant of quota,\npermit licence etc. by the State and its agencies/\nF instrumentalities should always be done in a fair and equitable\nmanner and the element of favoritism or nepotism shall not\ninfluence the exercise of discretion, if any, conferred upon the\nparticular functionary or officer of the State.\nE\nG\n32. We may add that there cannot be any policy, much\nless, a rational policy of allotting land on the basis of\napplications made by individuals, bodies, organizations or\ninstitutions de hors an invitation or advertisement by the State\nor its agency/instrumentality. By entertaining applications made\nby individuals, organisations or institutions for allotment of land\nH\nAKHIL BHARTIYA UPBHOKTA CONGRESS v. STATE 135\nOF MADHYA PRADESH AND ORS. [G.S. SINGHVI, J.]\nor for grant of any other type of largesse the State cannot A\nexclude other eligible persons from lodging competing claim.\nAny allotment of land or grant of other form of largesse by the\nState or its agencies/instrumentalities by treating the exercise\nas a private venture is liable to be treated as arbitrary,\ndiscriminatory and an act of favoritism and/or nepotism violating\nthe soul of the equality clause embodied in Article 14 of the\nConstitution.\nB\nC\nD\n33. This, however, does not mean that the State can never\nallot land to the institutions/organisations engaged in\neducational, cultural, social or philanthropic activities or are\nrendering service to the Society except by way of auction.\nNevertheless, it is necessary to observe that once a piece of\nland is earmarked or identified for allotment to institutions/\norganisations engaged in any such activity, the actual exercise\nof allotment must be done in a manner consistent with the\ndoctrine of equality. The competent authority should, as a matter\nof course, issue an advertisement incorporating therein the\nconditions of eligibility so as to enable all similarly situated\neligible persons, institutions/organisations to participate in the\nprocess of allotment, whether by way of auction or otherwise. E\nIn a given case the Government may allot land at a fixed price\nbut in that case also allotment must be preceded by a\nwholesome exercise consistent with Article 14 of the\nConstitution.\n34. The allotment of land by the State or its agencies/\ninstrumentalities to a body/organization/institution which carry\nthe tag of caste, community or religion is not only contrary to\nthe idea of Secular Democratic Republic but is also fraught with\ngrave danger of dividing the society on caste or communal\nlines. The allotment of land to such bodies/organisations/\ninstitutions on political considerations or by way of favoritism\nand/or nepotism or with a view to nurture the vote bank for future\nis constitutionally impermissible.\nF\nG\n35. We may now revert to the facts of this case. Admittedly, H\nC\n136 SUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2011] 5 S.C.R.\nA the application for reservation of land was made by Shri Kailash\nJoshi, in his capacity as convener of Memorial Trust. The\nrespondents have not placed on record any document to show\nthat on the date of application, the Memorial Trust was\nregistered as a public trust. During the course of hearing also\nB no such document was produced before the Court. It is also\nnot in dispute that respondent No. 5 was registered as a public\ntrust only on 6.10.2004 i.e. after the order for reservation of land\nin favour of the Memorial Trust was passed. The allotment was\nalso initially made in the name of trust, but, later on, the name\nof respondent No. 5 was substituted in place of the Memorial\nTrust. The exercise for reservation of 30 acres land and\nallotment of 20 acres was not preceded by any advertisement\nin the newspaper or by any other recognized mode of publicity\ninviting applications from organizations/institutions like the\nMemorial Trust or respondent No.5 for allotment of land and\neverything was done by the political and non-political\nfunctionaries of the State as if they were under a legal\nobligation to allot land to the Memorial Trust and/or respondent\nNo.5. The advertisements issued by the State functionaries\nwere only for inviting objections against the proposed\nreservation and/or allotment of land in favour of the Memorial\nTrust and not for participation in the process of allotment.\nTherefore, it is not possible to accept the argument of Shri\nRanjit Kumar that land was allotted to respondent No.5 after\nfollowing a procedure consistent with Article 14 of the\nF Constitution.\nD\nE\nG\nH\n36. Although, the objectives of respondent No. 5 are\nlaudable and the institute proposed to be established by it is\nlikely to benefit an important segment of the society but the fact\nremains that all its trustees are members of a particular party\nand the entire exercise for the reservation and allotment of land\nand waiver of major portion of the premium was undertaken\nbecause political functionaries of the State wanted to favour\nrespondent No. 5 and the officers of the State at different levels\nwere forced to toe the line of their political masters.\n"}
