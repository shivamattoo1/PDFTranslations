STATE 117\nOF MADHYA PRADESH AND ORS. [G.S. SINGHVI, J.]\nor zonal plan has been prepared. The only provision which has\nnexus with the Government land is contained in Rule 3 which,\nas mentioned above, imposes a bar against the transfer of\nGovernment land vested in or managed by the Authority except\nwith the general or special sanction of the State Government.\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\n13. We may now notice the relevant provisions of the RBC\nsome of which have been relied upon by the learned senior\ncounsel appearing for the respondents to justify the reservation\nand allotment of land in favour of respondent No. 5. Part IV of\nthe RBC deals with the management and regulation of Nazul\nland falling within the limits of municipal corporations, municipal\ncouncils and notified areas; and transfer thereof by lease, sale\netc. Paragraph 12 of this part lays down that Nazul land can\nbe disposed of by way of permanent lease, temporary lease,\non Bedawa karar, annual licence and also by transfer to the\nState Administration and department of any other State\nGovernment or Government of India or by vesting in any local\nauthority. In terms of paragraph 13(1), permanent lease can be\ngranted either by auction or without auction. Paragraph 13(2)\nenumerates the contingencies in which permanent lease cannot\nbe granted by auction. These include when the land in question\nis used for religious, educational, co-operative, public or social\npurposes. Paragraph 14 provides for reservation of the plots\nwhich are sold with the approval of the State Government on\nthe conditions separately decided for each such plot.\nParagraph 17 specifies the authorities who are competent to\npass orders in respect of Nazul land. Under this paragraph, the\npower to grant lease of Nazul land for educational institutions,\nplaygrounds, hospitals and other public purposes on\nconcessional rate as also the power to grant lease of Nazul land\nfor 30 years or less with a right of renewal vests with the State G\nGovernment, if the mode of disposal is otherwise than auction.\nThe residuary power also vests with the State Government.\nParagraph 18 lays down that a petition can be submitted to the\nhigher authority against any order which may be passed by an\nofficer subordinate to the State Government. Paragraph 19 H\nF\nC\nD\n118\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2011] 5 S.C.R.\nA lays down that every application for permanent lease of Nazul\nland should be made to the District Collector along with the\nrelevant documents, maps etc. Under paragraph 20, the\nCollector is empowered to reject the application by recording\nreasons. If the application is not rejected then the Collector has\nB to adopt the procedure specified in clauses (a), (b), (c), (d), (e)\nand (f) of this paragraph. If the plot of land is to be sold by\nauction then the same is required to be advertised or publicized\nby a recognized method. Paragraph 21 prescribes the mode\nof auction of lease rights. Any persons, desirous of participating\nin the auction is required to deposit 10 per cent of the premium.\nOnce the bid is approved by the competent authority, the bidder\nhas to deposit the balance amount within 30 days. This\nparagraph also provides for forfeiture of the premium and\nrecovery of the amount from the defaulter. Paragraph 23\nspecifies the minimum premium for different categories of plots.\nParagraph 24 lays down the procedure to be followed for\ndisposal of plot without auction. If any plot is proposed to be\ntransferred at a concessional premium then the approval of the\nState Government is sine qua non. In case, the Collector is\nsatisfied that the plot of land should be given without auction\nthen the allottee is required to pay premium equivalent to\naverage market price determined on the basis of the sale\ninstances of last five years. In terms of paragraph 25, the\nCollector is required to submit report to the Commissioner or\nto the Government through the Commissioner after scrutiny of\nF the matter at different stages. Paragraph 26 lays down that when\nNazul land is allotted to non-government organisations or\npersons on favourable terms then the conditions specified\ntherein should be scrupulously observed and there should be\nrigorous scrutiny of the proposal. Under this paragraph, land\nG can be allotted to educational, cultural and philanthropic\ninstitutions/organisations or Cooperative Societies, Housing\nBoard and Special Area Authority constituted by the State\nGovernment. However, unregistered societies and private trusts\nare not eligible for allotment of land. This paragraph also\nE\nH\nA\nAKHIL BHARTIYA UPBHOKTA CONGRESS v. STATE 119\nOF MADHYA PRADESH AND ORS. [G.S. SINGHVI, J.]\ncontemplates allotment of land for religious purposes or to Jain\nTemple, Mosque, Church, Gurdwara etc. provided that there is\nno similar place within two kilometers of the site proposed to\nbe allotted. Clause 1(a) and (b) of this paragraph prescribes\nthe premium required to be paid by different types of bodies\nand institutions. Clause 3 prescribes the condition relating to B\nconstruction of the building and Clause 5 provides for\nresumption of land in certain eventualities. By Circular No.6/16/\n91/Sat/SA/2B, the Government prescribed the revised rates for\nallotment of Nazul land to caste and non-caste based social,\nreligious and philanthropic organizations, the organizations C\nengaged in welfare of women, educational and cultural\norganizations, public hospitals, co-operative societies,\nagriculture market committee, municipal corporation etc. By\nCircular No. F.6-173/96/Sat/SA/2B/Nazul dated 31.5.1996, the\nState Government prescribed the premium and rent to be\ncharged for allotment of land to caste based and social\ninstitutions. By Circular No. F No. 6-140/07/SAT/Nazul dated\n31.8.2007, the State Government decided to allot land without\ncharging any premium at an annual rent of Re. 1/- for housing\nschemes meant for slum dwellers.\n14. We shall now consider whether the State Government\ncould allot 20 acres of land to respondent No.5 without issuing\nan advertisement or adopting a procedure consistent with the\ndoctrine of equality so as to enable other similar organizations/\ninstitutions to participate in the process of allotment.\n15. The concept of 'State' has changed in recent years. In\nall democratic dispensations the State has assumed the role\nof a regulator and provider of different kinds of services and\nbenefits to the people like jobs, contracts, licences, plots of land,\nmineral rights and social security benefits. In his work \"The\nModern State\" Maciver (1964 Paperback Edition) advocated\nthat the State should be viewed mainly as a service corporation.\nHe highlighted difference in perception about the theory of State\nin the following words:\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nA\n00\nB\nC\nD\n120\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS [2011] 5 S.C.R.\n\"To some people State is essentially a class-structure, \"an\norganization of one class dominating over the other\nclasses”; others regard it as an organisation that\ntranscends all classes and stands for the whole\ncommunity. They regard it as a power-system. Some view\nit entirely as a legal structure, either in the old Austinian\nsense which made it a relationship of governors and\ngoverned, or, in the language of modern jurisprudence, as\na community “organised for action under legal rules\". Some\nregard it as no more than a mutual insurance society,\nothers as the very texture of all our life. Some class the\nState as a great \"corporation\" and others consider it as\nindistinguishable from society itself.\"\n16. When the Constitution was adopted, people of India\nresolved to constitute India into a Sovereign Democratic\nRepublic. The words 'Socialist' and 'Secular' were added by\nthe Constitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act, 1976 and also\nto secure to all its citizens Justice - social, economic and\npolitical, Liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship;\nEquality of status and/or opportunity and to promote among\nE them all Fraternity assuring the dignity of the individual and the\nunity and integrity of the Nation. The expression 'unity of the\nNation' was also added by the Constitution (Forty-second\nAmendment) Act, 1976. The idea of welfare State is ingrained\nin the Preamble of the Constitution. Part III of the Constitution\nF enumerates fundamental rights, many of which are akin to the\nbasic rights of every human being. This part also contains\nvarious positive and negative mandates which are necessary\nfor ensuring protection of the Fundamental Rights and making\nthem real and meaningful. Part IV contains 'Directive Principles\nG of State Policy' which are fundamental in the governance of the\ncountry and it is the duty of the State to apply these principles\nin making laws. Article 39 specifies certain principles of policy\nwhich are required to be followed by the State. Clause (b)\nthereof provides that the State shall, in particular, direct its policy\ntowards securing that the ownership and control of the material\nH\nAKHIL BHARTIYA UPBHOKTA CONGRESS v. STATE 121\nOF MADHYA PRADESH AND ORS. [G.S. SINGHVI, J.]\nresources of the community are so distributed as best to sub- A\nserve the common good. Parliament and Legislatures of the\nStates have enacted several laws and the governments have,\nfrom time to time, framed policies so that the national wealth\nand natural resources are equitably distributed among all\nsections of people so that have-nots of the society can aspire B\nto compete with haves.\n17. The role of the Government as provider of services and\nbenefits to the people was noticed in R.D. Shetty v.\nInternational Airport Authority of India (1979) 3 SCC 489 in\nthe following words:\nC\n\"Today the Government in a welfare State, is the regulator\nand dispenser of special services and provider of a large\nnumber of benefits, including jobs, contracts, licences,\nquotas, mineral rights, etc. The Government pours forth D\nwealth, money, benefits, services, contracts, quotas and\nlicences. The valuables dispensed by Government take\nmany forms, but they all share one characteristic. They are\nsteadily taking the place of traditional forms of wealth.\nThese valuables which derive from relationships to E\nGovernment are of many kinds. They comprise social\nsecurity benefits, cash grants for political sufferers and the\nwhole scheme of State and local welfare. Then again,\nthousands of people are employed in the State and the\nCentral Governments and local authorities. Licences are\nrequired before one can engage in many kinds of\nbusinesses or work. The power of giving licences means\npower to withhold them and this gives control to the\nGovernment or to the agents of Government on the lives\nof many people. Many individuals and many more\nbusinesses enjoy largesse in the form of Government\ncontracts. These contracts often resemble subsidies. It is\nvirtually impossible to lose money on them and many\nenterprises are set up primarily to do business with\nGovernment. Government owns and controls hundreds of\nF\nG\nH\nI\nA\nB\nC\nD\n122\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2011] 5 S.C.R.\nacres of public land valuable for mining and other\npurposes. These resources are available for utilisation by\nprivate corporations and individuals by way of lease or\nlicence. All these mean growth in the Government largesse\nand with the increasing magnitude and range of\ngovernmental functions as we move closer to a welfare\nState, more and more of our wealth consists of these new\nforms. Some of these forms of wealth may be in the nature\nof legal rights but the large majority of them are in the nature\nof privileges\n\"\n18. For achieving the goals of Justice and Equality set out\nin the Preamble, the State and its agencies/instrumentalities\nhave to function through political entities and officers/officials\nat different levels. The laws enacted by Parliament and State\nLegislatures bestow upon them powers for effective\nimplementation of the laws enacted for creation of an\negalitarian society. The exercise of power by political entities\nand officers/officials for providing different kinds of services and\nbenefits to the people always has an element of discretion,\nwhich is required to be used in larger public interest and for\nE public good. In principle, no exception can be taken to the use\nof discretion by the political functionaries and officers of the\nState and/or its agencies/instrumentalities provided that this is\ndone in a rational and judicious manner without any\ndiscrimination against anyone. In our constitutional structure, no\nF functionary of the State or public authority has an absolute or\nunfettered discretion. The very idea of unfettered discretion is\ntotally incompatible with the doctrine of equality enshrined in the\nConstitution and is an antithesis to the concept of rule of law.\nG\n19. In his work ‘Administrative Law' (6th) Edition, Prof.\nH.W.R. Wade, highlighted distinction between powers of public\nauthorities and those of private persons in the following words:\n\"... The common theme of all the authorities so far\nmentioned is that the notion of absolute or unfettered\nAKHIL BHARTIYA UPBHOKTA CONGRESS v. STATE 123\nOF MADHYA PRADESH AND ORS. [G.S. SINGHVI, J.]\ndiscretion is rejected. Statutory power conferred for public A\npurposes is conferred as it were upon trust, no absolutely\n- that is to say, it can validly be used only in the right and\nproper way which Parliament when conferring it is\npresumed to have intended. Although the Crown's lawyers\nhave argued in numerous cases that unrestricted\npermissive language confers unfettered discretion, the truth\nis that, in a system based on the rule of law, unfettered\ngovernmental discretion is a contradiction in terms.\"\nProf. Wade went on to say:\nFF\nThe whole conception of unfettered discretion is\ninappropriate to a public authority, which possesses\npowers solely in order that it may use them for the public\ngood.\nThere is nothing paradoxical in the imposition of such legal\nlimits. It would indeed be paradoxical if they were not\nimposed. Nor is this principle an oddity of British or\nAmerican law; it is equally prominent in French law. Nor\nis it a special restriction which fetters only local authorities:\nit applies no less to ministers of the Crown. Nor is it\nconfined to the sphere of administration: it operates\nwherever discretion is given for some public purpose, for\nexample where a judge has a discretion to order jury trial.\nIt is only where powers are given for the personal benefit\nof the person empowered that the discretion is absolute.\nPlainly this can have no application in public law.\nFor the same reasons there should in principle be no such\nthing as unreviewable administrative discretion, which\nshould be just as much a contradiction in terms as\nunfettered discretion. The question which has to be asked\nis what is the scope of judicial review, and in a few special\ncases the scope for the review of discretionary decisions\nmay be minimal. It remains axiomatic that all discretion is\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n124\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2011] 5 S.C.R.\nA\nB\ncapable of abuse, and that legal limits to every power are\nto be found somewhere.\"\nG\n(emphasis supplied)\n20. Padfield v. Minister of Agriculture, Fishery and Food\n(1968) A.C. 997, is an important decision in the area of\nadministrative law. In that case the Minister had refused to\nappoint a committee to investigate the complaint made by the\nmembers of the Milk Marketing Board that majority of the Board\nhad fixed milk prices in a way that was unduly unfavourable to\nC the complainants. The Minister's decision was founded on the\nreason that it would be politically embarrassing for him if he\ndecided not to implement the committee's decision. While\nrejecting the theory of absolute discretion, Lord Reid observed:\nD\nE\nFL\nG\nH\n\"Parliament must have conferred the discretion with the\nintention that it should be used to promote the policy and\nobjects of the Act; the policy and objects of the Act must\nbe determined by construing the Act as a whole and\nconstruction is always a matter of law for the court. In a\nmatter of this kind it is not possible to draw a hard and\nfast line, but if the Minister, by reason of his having\nmisconstrued the Act or for any other reasons, so uses his\ndiscretion as to thwart or run counter to the policy and\nobjects of the Act, then our law would be very defective if\npersons aggrieved were not entitled to the protection of\nthe court.\"\n21. In Breen v. Amalgamated Engineering Union (1971)\n2 QB 175, Lord Denning MR said:\n\"The discretion of a statutory body is never unfettered. It\nis a discretion which is to be exercised according to law.\nThat means at least this: the statutory body must be guided\nby relevant considerations and not by irrelevantly. It its\ndecision is influenced by extraneous considerations which\nit ought not to have taken into account, then the decision\nAKHIL BHARTIYA UPBHOKTA CONGRESS v. STATE 125\nOF MADHYA PRADESH AND ORS. [G.S. SINGHVI, J.]\ncannot stand. No matter that the statutory body may have A\nacted in good faith; nevertheless the decision will be set\naside. That is established by Padfield v. Minister of\nAgriculture, Fisheries and Food which is a landmark in\nmodern administrative law.\"\n22. In Laker Airways Ltd. v. Department of Trade 1977 QB\n643, Lord Denning discussed prerogative of the Minister to\ngive directions to Civil Aviation Authorities overruling the\nspecific provisions in the statute in the time of war and said:\nB\n\"Seeing that prerogative is a discretion power to be C\nexercised for the public good, it follows that its exercise\ncan be examined by the Courts just as in other\ndiscretionary power which is vested in the executive.\"\n23. This Court has long ago discarded the theory of\nunfettered discretion. In S.G. Jaisinghani v. Union of India AIR\n1967 SC 1427, Ramaswami, J. emphasised that absence of\narbitrary power is the foundation of a system governed by rule\nof law and observed:\nD\nE\nF\n\"In this context it is important to emphasize that the\nabsence of arbitrary power is the first essential of the rule\nof law upon which our whole constitutional system is\nbased. In a system governed by rule of law, discretion,\nwhen conferred upon executive authorities, must be\nconfined within clearly defined limits. The rule of law from\nthis point of view means that decisions should be made\nby the application of known principles and rules and, in\ngeneral, such decisions should be predictable and the\ncitizen should know where he is. If a decision is taken\nwithout any principle or without any rule it is unpredictable G\nand such a decision is the antithesis of a decision taken\nin accordance with the rule of law. (See Dicey-\"Law of the\nConstitution\" - Tenth Edn., Introduction ex.). 'Law has\nreached its finest moments', stated Douglas, J. in United\nStates v. Underlick (1951 342 US 98:96 Law Ed 113), H\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n126\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2011] 5 S.C.R.\n\"when it has freed man from the unlimited discretion of\nsome ruler..... Where discretion is absolute, man has\nalways suffered'. It is in this sense that the rule of law\nmaybe said to be the sworn enemy of caprice. Discretion,\nas Lord Mansfield stated it in classic terms in the case of\nJohn Wilkes (1770 98 ER 327), 'means sound discretion\nguided by law. It must be governed by rule, not humour it\nmust not be arbitrary, vague and fanciful\"\n24. In Ramana Dayaram Shetty v. International Airport\nAuthority of India (supra), Bhagwati, J. referred to an article by\nProf. Reich \"The New Property\" which was published in 73 Yale\nLaw Journal. In the article, the learned author said, \"that the\nGovernment action be based on standard that are not arbitrary\nor unauthorized.\" The learned Judge then quoted with approval\nthe following observations made by Mathew, J. (as he then was)\nin V. Punnen Thomas v. State of Kerala AIR 1969 Ker. 81 (Full\nBench):\n\"The Government is not and should not be as free as an\nindividual in selecting recipients for its largesses. Whatever\nits activities, the Government is still the Government and\nwill be subject to the restraints inherent in its position in a\ndemocratic society. A democratic Government cannot lay\ndown arbitrary and capricious standards for the choice of\npersons with whom alone it will deal.\"\nBhagwati, J. also noticed some of the observations made\nby Ray, C.J. in Eursian Equipments and Chemicals Ltd. v.\nState of West Bengal (1975) 1 SCC 70 who emphasized that\nwhen the Government is trading with public the democratic form\nof Government demands equality and absence of arbitrariness\nand discrimination in such transactions and held:\n16\n……………………. This proposition would hold good in all cases of\ndealing by the Government with the public, where the\ninterest sought to be protected is a privilege. It must,\ntherefore, be taken to be the law that where the Government\n"}
