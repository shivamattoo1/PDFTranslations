The writ petitions were\ndismissed by High Court primarily on the ground that the\ncourt had no jurisdiction to extend the cut-off date as\nprovided in the judgment of Supreme Court in the case\nof *College of Professional Education.

Some\nD institutions filed writ petitions before this Court,\nchallenging the order declining grant of affiliation.\nE\nF\nG\nDisposing of the appeals and the writ petitions, the\nCourt\nHELD: 1.1. The National Council for Teachers\nEducation Act, 1993 (NCTE Act) is a special act enacted\nto cover a particular field, i.e. teacher training education\nand, thus, has to receive precedence over other laws in\nrelation to that field. No institution or body is empowered\nto grant recognition to any institution under the NCTE Act\nor any other law for the time being in force, except the\nNCTE itself. Grant of recognition by the Council is a\ncondition precedent to grant of affiliation by the examining\nbody to an institute. [Para 41] [849-G-H; 850-A]\n1.2. The non-obstante language of Section 16 of the\nNCTE Act requires the affiliating body to grant affiliation\nonly after recognition or permission has been granted by\nthe NCTE. The provisions of Section 16 give complete\nH supremacy to the expert body/NCTE in relation to grant\nMAA VAISHNO DEVI MAHILA MAHAVIDYALAYA v. 813\nSTATE OF U.P. \u0026 ORS.\nA\nof recognition. In fact, it renders the role of other bodies\nconsequential upon grant and/or refusal of recognition.\nWhen the NCTE is called upon to consider an application\nfor grant of recognition, it has to consider all the aspects\nin terms of Section 14(1)(a) of the NCTE Act. The\namplitude of this provision is very wide and hardly leaves B\nany matter relatable to an educational institution outside\nits ambit. Thus, the NCTE is a supreme body and is\nvested with wide powers to be exercised with the aid of\nits expertise, in granting or refusing to grant recognition\nto an educational institution. The NCTE is the paramount C\nbody for granting the approval/recognition not only for\ncommencing of fresh courses but even for increase in\nintake, etc. The Council has to ensure maintenance of\neducational standards as well as strict adherence to the\nprescribed parameters for imparting of such educational D\ncourses, including the infrastructure. The provision and\nscheme of the NCTE Act is pari materia to that of the\nMedical Council of India Act, 1956 and the All India\nCouncil for Technical Education Act, 1987 etc. [Para 42]\n[850-A-E]\nE\nF\n1.3. The Council is the authority constituted under the\nCentral Act with the responsibility of maintaining\nstandards of education and judging upon the infra-\nstructure and facilities available for imparting such\nprofessional education. Its opinion is of utmost\nimportance and shall take precedence over the views of\nthe State as well as that of the University. The concerned\nDepartment of the State and the affiliating University have\na role to play but it is limited in its application. They\ncannot lay down any guideline or policy which would be G\nin conflict with the Central statute or the standards laid\ndown by the Central body. State can frame its policy for\nadmission to such professional courses but such policy\nagain has to be in conformity with the directives issued\nby the Central body.

In the present cases, while the State grants its\napproval, and University its affiliation, for increased intake\nof seats or commencement of a new course/college, its\ndirections should not offend and be repugnant to what\nhas been laid down in the conditions for approval granted\nby the Central authority or Council. What is most\nimportant is that all these authorities have to work ad\nidem as they all have a common object to achieve i.e. of\nimparting of education properly and ensuring\nmaintenance of proper standards of education,\nexamination and infrastructure for betterment of\neducational system. [Para 47] [856-A-C]\n2.1. The NCTE Act was enacted by the Parliament\nwith reference to Entry 66 of List of Schedule VII of the\nConstitution. There is no such specific power vested in\nthe State Legislature under List II of the Seventh\nSchedule. Entry 25 of List III of the Seventh Schedule is\nthe other Entry that provides the field for legislation both\nto the State and the Centre, in relation to education,\nincluding technical education, medical education and\nUniversities; vocational and technical training and labour.\nThe field is primarily covered by the Union List and thus,\nthe State can exercise any legislative power under Entry\n25, List III but such law cannot be repugnant to the\nCentral law. Wherever the State law is irreconcilable with\nthe Central law, the State Law must give way in favour\nof the Central law to the extent of repugnancy.

Wherever the field is covered by the\nParliamentary law in terms of List I and List III, the law\nmade by the State Legislature would, to the extent of\nrepugnancy, be void. Of course, there has to be a direct\nconflict between the laws. The direct conflict is not\nnecessarily to be restricted to the obedience of one\nresulting in disobedience of other but even where the\nresult of one would be in conflict with the other. It is\ndifficult to state any one principle that would uniformly\nbe applicable to all cases of repugnancy. It will have to\nG\nbe seen in the facts of each case while keeping in mind\nthe laws which are in conflict with each other. Where the\nfield is occupied by the Centre, subject to the exceptions\nstated in Article 254, the State law would be void.

In the present case, the provisions of the NCTE\nAct is a Central legislation referable to Entry 66 of List I\nof the Seventh Schedule. Thus, no law enacted by the\nState, which is in conflict with the Central Law, can be\npermitted to be operative. [Para 54] [864-C]\n2.4. There is a possibility of some conflict between a\nUniversity Act or Ordinance relating to affiliation with the\nprovisions of the Central Act. In such cases, after coming\ninto operation of the Central Act, the operation of the\nUniversity Act would be deemed to have become\nunenforceable in case of technical colleges. The\nprovisions of the Universities Act regarding affiliation of\ntechnical colleges and conditions for grant of\ncontinuation of such affiliation by university would\nremain operative but the conditions that are prescribed\nby the university for grant and continuation of affiliation\nmust be in conformity with the norms and guidelines\nprescribed by the NCTE. [Para 56] [864-F-H; 865-A]\n2.5. Under Section 14 and particularly in terms of\nSection 14(3)(a) of the Act, the NCTE is required to grant\nor refuse recognition to an institute. It has been\nempowered to impose such conditions as it may\nconsider fit and proper keeping in view the legislative\nintent and object in mind. In terms of Section 14(6) of the\nAct, the examining body shall grant affiliation to the\ninstitute where recognition has been granted. Granting\nrecognition is the basic requirement for grant of affiliation.\nIt cannot be said that affiliation is insignificant or a mere\nformality on the part of the examining body. It is the\nrequirement of law that affiliation should be granted by\nthe affiliating body in accordance with the prescribed\nprocedure and upon proper application of mind.\nRecognition and affiliation are expressions of distinct\nmeaning and consequences. The purpose of recognition\nand affiliation is different. In the context of the Act,\nMAA VAISHNO DEVI MAHILA MAHAVIDYALAYA v. 817\nSTATE OF U.P. \u0026 ORS.\naffiliation enables and permits an institution to send its Œë\nstudents to participate in public examinations conducted\nby the examining body and secure the qualification in the\nnature of degrees, diploma and certificates. On the other\nhand, recognition is the licence to the institution to offer\na course or training in teaching education. The affiliating\nbody/examining body does not have any discretion to\nrefuse affiliation with reference to any of the factors which\nhave been considered by the NCTE while granting\nrecognition. [Para 57] [865-B-G]\nChairman, Bhartia Education Society v. State of\nHimachal Pradesh and Ors. (2011) 4 SCC 527: 2011 (2)\nSCR 461 relied on.\n-\nB\nC\nE\n2.6. Once the affiliating body acts within the\nfundamentals of Section 14 of the Act, possibility of a D\nconflict can always be avoided. The fields which are\nsought to be covered under the provisions of Section 37\nof the Universities Act and the Statutes of various\nuniversities are clearly common to the aspects which are\nsquarely covered by the specific language under the Act.\nThat being so, all State laws in regard to affiliation in so\nfar as they are covered by the Act must give way to the\noperation of the provisions of the Act. The requirements\nwhich have been examined and the conditions which\nhave been imposed by the NCTE shall prevail and cannot\nbe altered, re-examined or infringed under the garb of the\nState Law. The affiliating/examining body and the State\nGovernment must abide by the proficiency and command\nof the NCTE's directions. Existence of building, library,\nqualified staff, financial stability of the institution,\naccommodation, etc. are the subjects which are\nspecifically covered under Section 14(3)(b) of the Act.\nThus, they would not be open to re-examination by the\nState and the University. If the recognition itself was\nconditional and those conditions have not been satisfied,\nin such circumstances, within the ambit and scope of\nF\nG\nH\n818 SUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2012] 13 S.C.R.\nA Sections 46 and 16 of the Act, the affiliating body may not\ngive affiliation and inform the NCTE forthwith of the\nshortcomings and non-compliance of the conditions. In\nsuch situation, both the Central and the State body\nshould act in tandem and, with due coordination, come\nB to a final conclusion as to the steps which are required\nto be taken in regard to both recognition and affiliation.\nBut certainly, the State Government and the University\ncannot act in derogation to the NCTE. [Paras 59 and 61]\n[866-D; 867-G-H; 868-A-E]\n—Å\nSt. John Teachers Training Institute v. Regional Director,\nNational Council for Teacher Education (2003) 3 SCC 321:\n2003 (1) SCR 975 - relied on.\n2.7. The State opinion, as contemplated under\nD Section 37 of the University Act, to the extent it admits to\noverreach, is reconcilable and its results are not in its\norientation to the directives of the NCTE are void and\ninoperative to the extent they can be resolved in which\ncase clear precedence is to be given to the directives of\nE the NCTE during such resolution. The opinion of the\nState, therefore, has to be read and construed to mean\nthat it would keep the factors determined by the NCTE\nintact and then examine the matter for grant of affiliation.\nThe role of the State Government is minimised at this\nF stage which, in fact, is a second stage. It should primarily\nbe for the University to determine the grant or refusal of\naffiliation and role of the State should be bare, minimum\nnon-interfering and non-infringing. [Para 62] [868-F-H;\n869-A]\nG\n2.8. Once it grants recognition, then such grant\nattains supremacy viz-a-viz the State Government as well\nas the affiliating body. Normally, these questions cannot\nbe re-agitated at the time of grant of affiliation. Once the\nUniversity conducts inspection in terms of its Statutes or\nH Act, without offending the provisions of the Act and\nMAA VAISHNO DEVI MAHILA MAHAVIDYALAYA v. 819\nSTATE OF U.P. \u0026 ORS.\nconditions of recognition, then the opinion of the State A\nGovernment at the second stage is a mere formality\nunless there was a drastic and unacceptable mistake or\nthe entire process was vitiated by fraud or there was\npatently eminent danger to life of the students working\nin the school because of non-compliance of a B\nsubstantive condition imposed by either of the bodies. In\nthe normal circumstances, the role of the State is a very\nformal one and the State is not expected to obstruct the\ncommencement of admission process and academic\ncourses once recognition is granted and affiliation is\nfound to be acceptable. [Para 63] [869-D-G]\nC\nD\n2.9. The exercise of discretion by the State\nGovernment and affiliating body has to be within the\nframework of the Act, the Regulations and conditions of\nrecognition. The Court stated that the State Government\nor the Union Territory has to necessarily confine itself to\nthe guidelines issued by the NCTE while considering\napplication for grant of 'No Objection Certificate'.\nMinimization of the role of the State at the second stage\ncan also be justified on the ground that affiliation primarily E\nis a subject matter of the University which is responsible\nfor admission of the students laying down the criteria\nthereof, holding of examinations and implementation of\nthe prescribed courses while maintaining the standards\nof education as prescribed.
