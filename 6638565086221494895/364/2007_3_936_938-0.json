STATE OF MAHARASHTRA [MARKANDEY KATJU, J.] 937\nUday B. Dube (for Kuldip Singh) for the Appellants.\nSudhanshu Choudhari, Naresh Kumar, S.S. Shinde and V.N. Raghupathy\nfor the Respondents.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMARKANDEY KATJU, J. 1. Leave granted.\n2. This appeal has been filed against the impugned judgment of the\nBombay High Court (Aurangabad Bench) dated 12.4.2005 in Writ Petition.\nNo.455 of 2004.\n3. Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record.\n4. The petitioner has prayed for quashing the award dated 4.2.2003\npublished by the Special Land Acquisition Officer in respect of Renapur\nMedium Project at village Talegaon (Ghat). The High Court had dismissed\nthe writ petition and hence this appeal.\n5. The short point before us is whether the award was illegal in view\nof Section 11A of the Land Acquisition Act (hereinafter referred to as \"the\nAct\").\nA\nB\nC\nD\n6. The date of last publication of the notification under Section 4 of the E\nAct was 18.2.1999 (in Gazette). The last publication of the declaration under\nSection 6 of the Act was 28.2.2000 whereas the award was published on\n4.2.2003. According to the learned counsel for the appellant the award ought\nto have been published on or before 28.2.2000 which was the date of the last\ndeclaration under Section 6 of the Act. Learned counsel has invited our\nattention to Section 11A of the Act which states:\n\"11A. The collector shall make an award under Section 11 within\na period of two years from the publication of the declaration and if\nno award is made within that period, the entire proceedings for the\nacquisition of the land shall lapse.\"\n7. In our opinion the submission of learned counsel for the appellant\nis clearly correct in view of the clear provision of Section 11A of the Act. In\nview of Section 11A an award has to be made within two years from the date\nof publication of the declaration under Section 6. Failure to adhere to this\ntime frame is fatal to the award, as the provision is mandatory.\nF\nG\nH\nA\nB\nC\n938\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 3 S.C.R.\n8. Learned counsel for the respondent submitted that after the declaration\nunder Section 6 of the Act dated 28.2.2000 the acquiring body had intimated\nto the Land Acquisition Officer vide its communication dated 2.1.2001\nproposing deletion of some of the area which was proposed to be acquired.\nThe original declaration under Section 6 was regarding acquisition of 155.26\nhectares, but thereafter 107.99 hectares was proposed to be deleted. Hence\nthe final area which was proposed to be acquired was to the extent of 36.8\nhectares. Accordingly, a corrigendum to that effect was issued on 25.1.2003,\nand hence, it is submitted that the award dated 4.1.2003 was well within time.\nWe do not agree.\n9. In our opinion under Section 11A what has to be seen is the date\nof last publication of the declaration under Section 6, and not any subsequent\ncorrigendum to the said declaration. The only circumstance under which the\nperiod between the declaration under Section 6 and the award can be extended\nis mentioned in the explanation to Section 11A which states: \"In computing\nthe period of two years referred to in Section 11A, the period during which\nD any action or proceeding to be taken in pursuance of the said declaration is\nstayed by an order of a Court is excluded.\"\nE\n10. There is no mention in Section 11A that the period after the\npublication of the declaration under Section 6 and the publication of any\ncorrigendum to the said declaration has also to be excluded. We will be\nadding words to the statute if we put such interpretation to Section 11A, and\nit is well settled the Court should not add or delete words in a statute.\n11. In view of the above reasons this appeal is allowed. The impugned\naward is quashed. The impugned judgment is set aside. There shall be no\norder as to costs.\nF\nR.P.\nAppeal Allowed.\n"}
