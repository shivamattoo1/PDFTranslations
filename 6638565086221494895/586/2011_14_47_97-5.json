Admittedly, the complaint is filed A\nwithin a period of 2 years.\nFurther, Rule 33 which is quoted above, upon which\nheavy reliance was placed by the learned Counsel Mr.\nBhagat for Opposite Party No.1, in contending that this\nCommission would have no jurisdiction to decide the\nmatter, specifically provides that any clause contained in\nthe contract entered into before the damage occurred by\nwhich the parties purport to infringe the rules laid down by\nthe schedule, whether by deciding the law to be applied,\nor by altering the rules as to the jurisdiction, shall be null\nand void'.\nHence, Clause 12 of the airway bill would not be of\nany ground for holding that petition filed by the\nComplainant is barred by period limitation (sic.).\"\n55. We are in total agreement with the conclusion reached\nby the National Commission. Therefore, we do not see any\nmerit in the contention canvassed by the learned counsel for\nthe appellant-carrier.\n56. We conclude that the National Commission has\njurisdiction to decide the dispute between the parties and it is\na Court and that there was deficiency in service by the\nappellant-carrier.\n57. In view of the above discussion, we do not see any\nmerit in this appeal. Accordingly, it is dismissed. Parties are\ndirected to bear their own costs.\nD.G.\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nAppeal dismissed. G\n"}
