Hence the\npresent appeal.\nDismissing the appeal, the Court\n818\nS\nRAMKRUSHNA v. STATE OF MAHARASHTRA\n819\nHELD: 1. The First Information Report was lodged at the earliest possible A\ntime. P.W.1 was approached by the first informant P.W. 8 soon after the\nincident. He categorically stated that the appellant and the accused no.1 were\nnamed as the assailants of deceased by P.W. 8. Disclosure of the names of the\nassailants of the deceased by P.W. 8 at the earliest possible opportunity, being\nnot in dispute, the court below did not commit any error whatsoever in believing\nthe prosecution case. [Para 8 and 9] [822-G-H; 823-A]\nB\nC\n2. The evidence of P.W.8 fully supported the prosecution case. He was\nthe first person to arrive at the place of occurrence on hearing the cries of\nhis further. He had to break open the door. He found the accused coming out\nof the room. He had asked them to wait but hey ran away. The fact that his\ndoors were bolted from outside to prevent any male member from assaulting\nthe accused and his arriving at the scene of occurrence immediately after he\nassault took place is beyond any shadow of doubt. He found the deceased with\nbleeding injuries at several places on his person. He also found the butt of\nthe knife embedded in the stomach of the deceased. His step mother P.W. 3\ncategorically stated that it was the accused who had assaulted the deceased. D\nShe might have turned hostile but she had seen two persons in the room.\nAccused No.1 was one of them. She in her examination-in-chief although\nstated that she could not identify the other person, but in her cross-\nexamination by the prosecution, she categorically stated that a person other\nthan accused no.1 threatened her on the point of knife preventing her from\nshouting. P.W. 3 identified the appellant in the court. She categorically stated E\nthat the accused before the Court was the same person who had been preventing\nher from shouting at the point of knife. [Para 12] [823-C, D, E, F]\n3.1. From the post-mortem report it appears that the deceased had\nsuffered as many as seven ante-mortem injuries. In the opinion of surgeon,\nthe probable cause of death was shock and hemorrhage because of multiple\nexternal injuries and injuries to internal organs like heart and intestine. P.W.\n6 proved that the appellant had hired a cycle from him. He also identified him\nthe court as the person who had hired the cycle.\n[Para 14 and 15] [823-G, H; 824-A-B]\n3.2.

The High Court might not have dealt with the question of motive\nelaborately but when the presence of the appellant with accused no.1 has been\nestablished, motive takes a back seat. Appellant must have come to the place\nof occurrence. He came with a knife. The knife injuries were found. Even if\nthe prosecution has not been able to establish as to the exact role played by\neach of the accused, the fact that both the accused had common intention to\nC commit the crime stood established. The Trial Judge cannot be said to have\ncommitted any error in relying upon the testimony of P.W. 3 in part. It is\npermissible in law. [Para 18] [824-E, F]\nSema Bhai v.

Appeal No. 31 of 1991.\nDr. Rajiv Masudkar and Satyajit Desai (for Venkateshwara Rao Anumolu)\nfor the Appellant.\nRavindra Keshavrao Adsure for the Respondent.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nS.B. SINHA, J. 1. Appellant who was accused No. 2 before the trial\njudge is before us, aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the judgment dated\n16.6.2006 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Bombay, Nagpur Bench,\nNagpur in Criminal Appeal No. 31 of 1991 whereby and whereunder appeal\nx\nRAMKRUSHNA v. STATE OF MAHARASHTRA [S.B. SINHA, J.] 821\npreferred by him from a judgment dated 22.1.1991 passed by the Additional A\nSessions Judge, Chandrapur convicting him for commission of an offence\nunder Section 302/34 of the Indian Penal Code was dismissed. The parties are\nclosely related. The deceased was one Kannu Shende. Accused No. 1 (since\ndeceased) was Baliram. Appellant being the accused No. 2 before the Ld. Trial\nJudge was the brother in law of said Baliram. There were two eye witnesses\nto the occurrence in question. P.W. 3 Shobha was his wife and P.W. 8.\nDnyaneshwar was his son. At this stage, we may notice that Dnyaneshwar\nlater on killed Baliram. He was sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment\nfor life. When the trial in this matter was going on, he was undergoing his\nsentence.\nB\nC\n2. Prosecution case is that there had been a dispute by and between\nthe deceased and the said Baliram with regard to the partition of the joint\nfamily properties. Deceased Baliram also had asked for the motor cycle belonging\nto the deceased which was denied. In the midnight at about 2 a.m. on\n21.9.1986 both the accused came to the house of the deceased. Accused No.\n1 was armed with a large stick known as “Ubhari”. Appellant was armed with D\na knife. They had shut the door of the room where Dnyaneshwar was sleeping.\nThe door between the room of the deceased and his wife Shobha was,\nhowever, open. On hearing a cry of her husband, Shobha came out. Appellant\nthreatened her at the point of a knife asking her not to shout. Both the\naccused then assaulted deceased Kannu Shende with Ubhari (stick) and\nknife.\nE\n3. P.W. 8 heard the cries of his father. He tried to come out but found\nthe doors closed. He could break open the door. He came out of the room\nand went to that of his father and saw both the accused coming out of the\nroom. They ran away through the courtyard. He found his father in an injured F\ncondition. He also saw bleeding injuries on his person. He shouted for help\nwhereupon 20-25 persons from the locality arrived. Shobha, P.W. 3 disclosed\nto him that the accused had assaulted the deceased. P.W. 8 went to the Police\nPatil, Vishwanath, P.W. 1 immediately. He wrote down a Report. P.W. 1 came\nto the house and thereafter went with P.W. 8 to Sindewahi Police Station\nwhere First Information Report was lodged. The Police Station is situate at\nabout 9 kilometers from the Village. The report was recorded at about 6.45 a.m.\n4. During investigation, Appellant herein made a confession leading to\nrecovery of the handle of the knife which is said to have been used for\ncausing the murder of the deceased.\nG\nH\nA\nB\n822\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 5 S.C.R.\n5. Before the learned trial judge, inter alia the wife of the deceased was\nexamined. She turned hostile. Two other witnesses P.W. 5, Nilesh and P.W.\n7 Uttam who had made statements before the Police that they alongwith\nBaliram and Ramkrushna came to the village on cycle were also declared\nhostile. The learned trial judge, however, relied upon the statements of\nDnyaneshwar (P.W. 8) and to some extent the deposition of P.W. 3, Shobha.\nThe appellant was found to be guilty of commission of the said offence.\nAppeal preferred by the appellant thereagainst as noticed hereinbefore has\nbeen dismissed.\n6. Dr. Rajiv Masudkar, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the\nC appellant in support of this appeal inter alia would submit:-\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n(i)\nAs the sole eye-witness P.W. 3 had turned hostile, a judgment\nof conviction cannot be sustained.\n(i) The High Court committed a serious irregularity in not scrutinizing\ndeeply the statements of P.W. 8 as he was not an eye-witness\nand furthermore contradicted himself in material particulars.\n(iii) The butt of the knife having been recovered from an open place,\nno reliance could have been placed on the recovery thereof.\n(iv) The High Court did not deal with the question of motive for\ncommission of the crime elaborately.\n7. Mr. Ravindra Keshavrao Adsure, learned counsel appearing on behalf\nof the respondent on the other hand, in support of the judgment would\nsubmit;\n(i) The courts below did not commit any mistake in relying upon the\nevidence of P.W. 3 which clearly supports the prosecution case.\n(ii) P.W. 4 having proved the recovery of the handle of the knife, the\ninvolvement of the appellant stands proved.\n(iii) The Serologist Report clearly establishes that samples of human\nblood found in the butt of the knife and that of the deceased\nwere of the same group.\n8. Indisputably, the First Information Report was lodged at the earliest\npossible time. The Police Patil, P.W. 1 was approached by the first informant\nP.W. 8 soon after the incident. He categorically stated that the appellant and\nthe deceased Baliram were named as the assailants of his deceased by P.W. 8.\nx\nRAMKRUSHNA v. STATE OF MAHARASHTRA [S.B. SINHA, J.] 823\n9. Disclosure of the names of the assailants of the deceased by P.W. A\n8 at the earliest possible opportunity, being not in dispute, the courts below\nin our opinion did not commit any error whatsoever in believing the prosecution\ncase.\n10. P.W. 8 was the son of the deceased, he accepted that he had killed\nBaliram and had been undergoing the sentence of life imprisonment for B\ncommission of the said offence.\n11. The description of the house has not been disputed. Evidence of\nthe Investigating Officer Ganpatrao Darwadkar, P.W. 9 clearly shows that one\ncane containing kerosene oil and other articles were found near the place of\nC\noccurrence.\nD\n12. Dyaneshwar's evidence fully supported the prosecution case. He\nwas the first person to arrive at the place of occurrence on hearing the cries\nof his father. He had to break open the door. He found the accused coming\nout of the room. He had asked them to wait but they ran away. The fact that\nhis doors were bolted from outside to prevent any male member from assaulting\nthe accused and his arriving at the scene of occurrence immediately after the\nassault took place is beyond any shadow of doubt. He found the deceased\nwith bleeding injuries at several places on his person. He also found the butt\nof the knife embedded in the stomach of the deceased. His step mother P.W.\n3 categorically stated that it was the accused who had assaulted the deceased. E\nShe might have turned hostile but she had seen two persons in the room.\nAccused No. 1 was one of them. She in her examination-in-chief although\nstated that she could not identify the other person, but in her cross examination\nby the prosecution, she categorically stated that a person other than Baliram\nthreatened her on the point of knife preventing her from shouting. Baliram\nuttered the words, according to her “Ramya Kai Pahates\". There are materials\non records to show that Appellant was having a knife.\n13. P.W. 3 identified the appellant in the court. She categorically stated\nthat the accused before the Court was the same person who had been\npreventing her from shouting at the point of knife.\n14. From the post-mortem report it appears that the deceased had\nsuffered as many as seven ante-mortem injuries. On examination of the dead\nbody of the deceased the Autopsy Surgeon in his report observed:\nF\nG\n\"This wound along with the same hand weapon which was a knife, H\n824\nA\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 5 S.C.R.\nwhich was 5 to 6 inches in length blackish colour made up of iron with\ninto handle, one side of which was sharp and Narrowing toward the\nto its (sic).\"\n15. In his opinion, the probable cause of death was shock and hemorrhage\nbecause of multiple external injuries and injuries to internal organs like heart\nB and intestine. P.W. 6, Keshav Laman Gamdar proved that the appellant had\nhired a cycle from him. He also identified him in the court as the person who\nhad hired the cycle.\n16. The Chemical Analyst's Report (Ext. 38) establishes that human\nblood was found on the knife and also on the butt of the knife having been\nC\nrecovered at the instance of the appellant, is also of some significance.\nDiscovery of the said fact is admissible under Section 27 of the Indian\nEvidence Act.\n17. It is also not correct to contend that the butt of the knife was\nD recovered from an open place. According to P.W. 4, the knife was found in\nthe pitch of manure at Village Chikhalgaon of which the appellant was the\nresident. He categorically stated that the butt of the knife could not have been\nseen by a person passing through the road. Clothes of the appellant were also\nrecovered at his instance.\nE\nF\nG\n18. The High Court might not have dealt with the question of motive\nelaborately but when the presence of the appellant with Balram has been\nestablished, motive takes a back seat. Appellant must have come to the place\nof occurrence. He came with a knife. The knife injuries were found. Even if\nthe prosecution has not been able to establish as to the exact role played by\neach of the accused, the fact that both the accused had common intention\nto commit the crime stood established. Submissions of the learned counsel\nfor the State in this behalf are of some significance. The learned Trial Judge\nas also the Trial Court cannot be said to have committed any error in relying\nupon the testimony of the P.W. 3 in part. It is in our opinion permissible in\nlaw. [See Soma Bhai v. State of Gujarat, AIR (1975) SC 1453]\n19. It is well-settled that the courts are entitled to rely upon a part of\nthe testimony of a witness who has been permitted to be cross-examined by\nthe prosecution.\n20. In State of U.P. v. Ramesh Prasad Misra and Anr., [1996] 10 SCC\nH\nx\nRAMKRUSHNA v. STATE OF MAHARASHTRA [S.B. SINHA, J.] 825\n360, this Court opined:\nA\n\"7....It is equally settled law that the evidence of a hostile witness.\nwould not be totally rejected if spoken in favour of the prosecution\nor the accused, but it can be subjected to close scrutiny and that\nportion of the evidence which is consistent with the case of the\nprosecution or defence may be accepted...\"\nB\n[See also Gurpreet Singh v.
