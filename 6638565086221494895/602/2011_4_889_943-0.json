The adjudication officer\n(the Special Director) came to the conclusion that the\nallegation made against the appellant of contravention of\nthe provisions of Section 8, 9(1)(f)(i) and Section 8(2) read\nF with Section 64(2) of the Act were not sustainable. The\nEnforcement Directorate did not challenge this order and\nit attained finality.\nG\nH\nThe Enforcement Directorate on the same allegation\nwhich was the subject matter of adjudication proceeding\nlaid complaint against the appellant for prosecution\nunder Section 56 of the Act before the Metropolitan\nMagistrate. After the issuance of process and exoneration\nin the adjudication proceeding, the appellant filed\nRADHEYSHYAM KEJRIWAL v. STATE OF WEST 891\nBENGAL\napplication for dropping the proceedings, inter alia, A\ncontending that on the same allegation the adjudication\nproceedings having been dropped and the appellant\nexonerated, his continued prosecution is an abuse of the\nprocess of the Court. The Metropolitan Magistrate rejected\nhis prayer. Aggrieved, the appellant preferred criminal B\nrevision application which was dismissed by the High\nCourt by the impugned order.\nIn the instant appeal, dispute arose as to whether the\nEnforcement Directorate (ED) could prosecute the\nappellant in a proceeding under Section 56 of the FERA\nwhen on the self-same facts and cause of action, the\nrespondent-adjudicating authority had dropped the\ncharges framed against the appellant under Section 50\nof the FERA.\nC\nD\nIt was contended on behalf of the appellant that\nstandard of proof required to bring home the charge in a\ncriminal case is much higher than the adjudication\nproceeding and once the appellant was exonerated in the\nadjudication proceeding, his prosecution was an abuse E\nof the process of Court.\nAllowing the appeal (per majority),\nPer Chandramauli Kr. Prasad, J. (for Harjit Singh Bedi, J.\nand himself):\nF\nHELD: 1. Section 50 of the Foreign Exchange\nRegulation Act, 1973 (FERA) provides for mandatory\npenalty and fixes the outer limit of such penalty on any\nperson contravening the provisions of the Act which is G\nto be adjudged by the Director of Enforcement or any\nother officer of the Enforcement not below the rank of an\nAssistant Director empowered by the Central Government.\nThe procedure and the power to adjudicate penalty has\nH\n892\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2011] 4 S.C.R.\nA been provided under Section 51 of the Act. From a plain\nreading of Section 51 of the Act it is evident that for\nadjudging the penalty under Section 51 of the Act for\ncontravention of the provisions of the Act or any rule,\ndirection or order made thereunder the adjudicating\nB officer is to be satisfied that the person has committed\nthe contravention after holding an inquiry in the\nprescribed manner and after giving the person\nconcerned a reasonable opportunity of making\nrepresentation. Thus besides the procedural requirement\nthe sine qua non for imposition of penalty under Section\n51 of the Act is that the adjudicating officer has to record\nits satisfaction that the person concerned has committed\nthe contravention of any of the provisions of the Act or\nof any rule, direction or order made thereunder. [Paras\n8, 9] [903-E-H; 904-A-G]\nC\nD\n2. As would be evident from the preamble of the\nFERA, it was enacted for the conservation of foreign\nexchange resources of the Country and the proper\nutilization thereof in the economic development of the\nE Country. The proceedings under Section 51 and 56 of the\nAct are independent of each other and the finding in an\nadjudication proceeding under Section 51 of the Act is\nnot binding in the proceeding for prosecution under\nSection 56 of the Act and both can go hand in hand.\nF Further, the prosecution can be launched even before\nconclusion of adjudication proceeding under Section 51\nof the Act. [Paras 10, 11] [904-H; 905-H; 906-A-C]\nG\nI\n3. The standard of proof in a criminal case is much\nhigher than that of the adjudication proceeding. The\nEnforcement Directorate has not been able to prove its\ncase in the adjudication proceeding and the appellant has\nbeen exonerated on the same allegation. The appellant\nis facing trial in the criminal case. Therefore, the\ndetermination of facts in the adjudication proceeding\nRADHEYSHYAM KEJRIWAL v. STATE OF WEST 893\nBENGAL\ncannot be said to be irrelevant in the criminal case. A\nHowever, the finding in an adjudication proceeding is not\nbinding in the proceeding for criminal prosecution. A\nperson held liable to pay penalty in adjudication\nproceeding cannot necessarily be held guilty in criminal\ntrial. Adjudication proceedings are decided on the basis B\nof preponderance of evidence of a little higher degree\nwhereas in a criminal case entire burden to prove beyond\nall reasonable doubt lies on the prosecution. [Paras 15,\n16] [909-H; 910-A-B; 911-F-G]\nC\n4. The yardstick would be to judge as to whether\nallegation in the adjudication proceeding as well as\nproceeding for prosecution is identical and the\nexoneration of the person concerned in the adjudication\nproceeding is on merits. In case it is found on merit that\nD\nthere is no contravention of the provisions of the Act in\nthe adjudication proceeding, the trial of the person\nconcerned shall be in abuse of the process of the court.\n[Para 19] [916-A-B]\n5. In the instant case, in the adjudication proceeding E\non merit the adjudicating authority has categorically held\nthat \"the charges against Shri Radheshyam Kejriwal for\ncontravening the provisions of Section 9(1)(f)(i) and\nSection 8(2) read with Section 64(2) of the Foreign\nExchange Regulation Act, 1973 cannot be sustained‚Äù. In F\nthe face of the aforesaid finding by the Enforcement\nDirectorate in adjudication proceeding that there is no\ncontravention of any of the provisions of the Act, it would\nbe unjust and an abuse of the process of the court to\npermit the Enforcement Directorate to continue with the\ncriminal prosecution. [Para 23] [919-F-H; 910-A]\n6. In the result the impugned judgment of the\nMetropolitan Magistrate and the order affirming the same\nG\nH\n894 SUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2011] 4 S.C.R.\nA by the High Court are set aside and appellant's\nprosecution is quashed.

The Foreign Exchange Regulation Act,\n1973 (FERA) being a statute relating to economic\noffences, there is no reason to restrict the scope of any\nprovisions of the Act. These provisions ensure that no\neconomic loss is caused by the alleged contravention by C\nthe imposition of an appropriate penalty after\nadjudication under Section 51 of the Act and to ensure\nthat the tendency to violate is guarded by imposing\nappropriate punishment after due transaction in terms of\nSection 56 of the Act. In fact, Section 23D of the Foreign D\nExchange Regulation Act, 1947 had a proviso, which\nindicates that the adjudication for the imposition of\npenalty should precede making of complaint in writing to\nthe court concerned for prosecuting the offender. The\nabsence of a similar proviso to Section 51 or to Section E\n56 of the 1973 Act is a clear indication that the Legislature\nintended to treat the two proceedings as independent of\neach other. There is nothing in the present Act to indicate\nthat a finding in adjudication is binding on the Court in a\nprosecution under Section 56 of the Act or that the F\nprosecution under Section 56 depends upon the result\nof adjudication under Section 51 of the Act. The two\nproceedings are independent and irrespective of the\noutcome of the decision under Section 50, there cannot\nbe any bar in initiating prosecution under Section 56. The\nscheme of the Act makes it clear that the adjudication by\nthe concerned authorities and the prosecution are distinct\nand separate. No doubt, the conclusion of the\nadjudication, in the case on hand, the decision of the\nG\nH\n896 SUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2011] 4 S.C.R.\nA Special Director, may be a point for the appellant and it\nis for him to put forth the same before the Magistrate.\nInasmuch as FERA contains certain provisions and\nfeatures which cannot be equated with the provisions of\nIncome Tax Act or the Customs Act and in the light of the\nB mandate of Section 56 of the FERA, it is the duty of the\nCriminal Court to discharge its functions vest with it and\ngive effect to the legislative intention, particularly, in the\ncontext of the scope and object of FERA which was\nenacted for the economic development of the country\nC and augmentation of revenue. Though the Act has since\nbeen repealed and not available at present, those\nprovisions cannot be lightly interpreted taking note of the\nobject of the Act. [Para 23] [942-D-H; 943-A-D]\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n2. In view of the above, the conclusion arrived at by\nthe Metropolitan Magistrate, Calcutta as well as the\ndecision of the High Court are upheld.

Shorn of unnecessary details facts giving rise to the\npresent appeal are that on 22nd May, 1992 various premises\nin occupation of the appellant Radheshyam Kejriwal besides\nother persons were searched by the officers of the Enforcement\nDirectorate. The appellant was arrested on 3rd May, 1992 by\nthe officers of the Enforcement Directorate in exercise of the\npower under Section 35 of the Foreign Exchange Regulation\nAct, 1973 (hereinafter referred to as the 'Act') and enlarged on\nbail on the same day.
