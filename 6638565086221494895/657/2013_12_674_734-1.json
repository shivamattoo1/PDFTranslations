INST. OF CARDIO VASCULAR DISE. BY ITS 689\nDIR. - DR. K.M. CHERIAN [RANJANA PRAKASH DESAI, J.]\nv. State of Andhra Pradesh' which is followed in another two- A\nJudge Bench decision in Japani Sahoo v. Chandra Sekhar\nMohanty² and a three-Judge Bench decision of this Court in\nKrishna Pillai v. T.A. Rajendran \u0026 Anr.³. In Bharat Kale it was\nheld that for the purpose of computing the period of limitation,\nthe relevant date is the date of filing of complaint or initiating B\ncriminal proceedings and not the date of taking cognizance by\na Magistrate or issuance of a process by court. In Krishna\nPillai this Court was concerned with Section 9 of the Child\nMarriage Restraint Act, 1929 which stated that no court shall\ntake cognizance of any offence under the Child Marriage C\nRestraint Act, 1929 after the expiry of one year from the date\non which the offence is alleged to have been committed. The\nthree-Judge Bench held that since magisterial action in the\ncase before it was beyond the period of one year from the date\nof commission of the offence, the Magistrate was not competent D\nto take cognizance when he did in view of bar under Section 9\nof the Child Marriage Restraint Act, 1929. Thus, there was\napparent conflict on the question whether for the purpose of\ncomputing the period of limitation under Section 468 of the\nCode of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short 'the Cr.P.C.') in E\nrespect of a criminal complaint the relevant date is the date of\nfiling of the complaint or the date of institution of prosecution\nor whether the relevant date is the date on which a Magistrate\ntakes cognizance. The two-Judge Bench, therefore, directed\nthat this case may be put up before a three-Judge Bench for\nan authoritative pronouncement. When the matter was placed\nbefore the three-Judge Bench, the three-Judge Bench doubted\nthe correctness of Krishna Pillai and observed that as a co-\nordinate Bench, it cannot declare that Krishna Pillai does not\nlay down the correct law and, therefore, the matter needs to be G\nreferred to a five-Judge Bench to examine the correctness of\nthe view taken in Krishna Pillai.

No specific questions have been referred to us. But, in\nour opinion, the following questions arise for our consideration:\nA.\nB.\nWhether for the purposes of computing the period\nof limitation under Section 468 of the Cr.P.C the\nrelevant date is the date of filing of the complaint\nor the date of institution of prosecution or whether\nthe relevant date is the date on which a Magistrate\ntakes cognizance of the offence?\nWhich of the two cases i.e. Krishna Pillai or Bharat\nKale (which is followed in Japani Sahoo) lays down\nthe correct law.\n3. We have heard learned counsel for the parties at great\nlength and carefully read their written submissions. We may\ngive gist of their submissions and then proceed to answer the\nquestions which fall for our consideration.\n4. Gist of submissions of Mr. Krishnamurthi Swami,\nlearned counsel for the appellant in Criminal Appeal No. 829\nof 2005.\nF\nG\n☐ H\na.\nKrishna Pillai was rendered in the context of\nSection 9 of the Child Marriage Restraint Act,\n1929. There is no reference to either Section 468\nor Section 473 of the Cr.P.C. in this judgment. This\njudgment merely focuses on the meaning of the term\n'taking cognizance' and has accordingly interpreted\nSection 9 without reference to any provisions of the\nCr.P.C. Hence, this judgment cannot be considered\nauthority for the purposes of interpretation of\nprovisions of Chapter XXXVI. On the other hand\nBharat Kale considers various provisions of\nChapter XXXVI. All the provisions have been\nSARAH MATHEW v. INST. OF CARDIO VASCULAR DISE. BY ITS 691\nDIR. -DR. K.M. CHERIAN [RANJANA PRAKASH DESAI, J.]\nb.\nC.\nd.\ncumulatively read to conclude that the limitation\nprescribed is not for taking cognizance within the\nperiod of limitation, but for taking cognizance of an\noffence in regard to which a complaint is filed or\nprosecution is initiated within the period of the\nlimitation prescribed under the Cr.P.C. This\njudgment lays down the correct law.\nA\nB\nC\nSection 468 of the Cr.P.C. has to be read keeping\nin view other provisions particularly Section 473 of\nthe Cr.P.C. A person filing a complaint within time\ncannot be penalized because the Magistrate did\nnot take cognizance. A person filing a complaint\nafter the period of limitation can file an application\nfor condonation of delay and the Magistrate could\ncondone delay if the explanation is reasonable. If\nSection 468 is interpreted to mean that a D\nMagistrate cannot take cognizance of an offence\nafter the period of limitation without any reference\nto the date of filing of the complaint or the institution\nof the prosecution it would be rendered\nunconstitutional. A court of law would interpret a\nprovision which would help sustaining the validity of\nthe law by applying the doctrine of reasonable\nconstruction rather than accepting an interpretation\nwhich may make such provision unsustainable and\nultra vires the Constitution. [U.P. Power Corpon. F\nLtd. v. Ayodhya Prasad Mishra \u0026 Anr^].\nChapter XXXVI requires to be harmoniously\ninterpreted keeping the interests of both the\ncomplainant as well as the accused in mind.\nThe law of limitation should be interpreted from the\nstandpoint of the person who exercises the right and\nwhose remedy would be barred. The laws of\n4. (2008) 10 SCC 139.\nE\nG\nH\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\n0\n692\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\ne.\nf.\ng.\nh.\n[2013] 12 S.C.R.\nlimitation do not extinguish the right but only bar the\nremedy. [Mela Ram v. The Commissioner of\nIncome Tax Punjab].5\nIf delay in filing a complaint can be condoned in\nterms of Section 473 of the Cr.P.C. then, Section\n468 of the Cr.P.C cannot be interpreted to mean\nthat a complaint or prosecution instituted within time\ncannot be proceeded with, merely because the\nMagistrate took cognizance after the period of\nlimitation.\nThe question of delay in launching a criminal\nprosecution may be a circumstance to be taken into\nconsideration while arriving at a final decision.\nHowever, the same may not by itself be a ground\nfor dismissing the complaint at the threshold. [Udai\nShankar Awasthi v. State of U.P. \u0026 Anr.6]. In certain\nexceptional circumstances delay may have to be\ncondoned considering the gravity of the charge.\nThe contention that Section 468 should be\ninterpreted to mean that where the Magistrate does\nnot take cognizance within the period of limitation\nit must be treated as having the object of giving\nquietus to petty offences in the Indian Penal Code\nis untenable. Some offences which fall within the\nperiods of limitation specified in Section 468 of the\nCr.P.C are serious. It could never have been the\nintention of the legislature to accord quietus to such\noffences.\nProcedure is meant to sub-serve and not rule the\ncause of justice. Procedural laws must be liberally\nconstrued to really serve as handmaid. Technical\n5. 1956 SCR 166.\nH 6. (2013) 2 SCC 435.\nSARAH MATHEW v. INST. OF CARDIO VASCULAR DISE. BY ITS 693\nDIR. - DR.

Krishna Pillai rightly\nholds that the relevant date for considering period\nof limitation is the date of taking cognizance.\nB\nC\nThe settled principies of statutory construction D\nrequire that the expression 'cognizance' occurring\nin Chapter XXXVI of the Cr.P.C. has to be given\nits legal sense, since it has acquired a special\nconnotation in criminal law. It is a settled position\nin law that taking cognizance is judicial application E\nof mind to the contents of a complaint/police report\nfor the first time. [R.R. Chari v.
