Pertinently, Section 467\ndefines the expression 'period of limitation' as the\nperiod specified in Section 468 for taking\ncognizance of an offence. The express language of\nSection 468 makes it clear that the legislature\nconsiders the relevant date for computing the date\nof limitation to be the date of taking cognizance and\nnot the date of filing of a complaint. Further, the.\nsituations in Section 470 of the Cr.P.C. providing\nfor exclusion in computing the period of limitation\nare again relatable to taking cognizance and\ninstitution of prosecution. So also, exclusion under\nSection 471 of the Cr.P.C. relates only to taking\ncognizance and Section 473 of the Cr.P.C. also\nprovides for extension of period of limitation in\ntaking cognizance.\nThe scheme of the Cr.P.C. envisages cognizance\nto be the point of initiation of proceedings. Chapter\nXIV of the Cr.P.C. which contains provisions of\ntaking cognizance is titled \"Conditions requisite for\ninitiation of proceedings\". All provisions contained\ntherein use the expression 'cognizance'. They do\nnot refer to filing of complaint at all.\nWhere the words of a statute are absolutely clear\nand unambiguous, recourse cannot be had to the\nprinciples of interpretation other than the literal rule.\nEven if the literal interpretation results in hardship\nor inconvenience it has to be followed (Raghunath\nRai Bareja and Anr. v. Punjab National Bank and\nOrs. 13). On a plain and literal interpretation of\nH 13. (2007) 2 SCC 230.\nSARAH MATHEW v. INST. OF CARDIO VASCULAR DISE. BY ITS 695\nDIR. - DR. K.M.

It reflects a well laid out scheme which\nenvisages judicial application of mind to be a pre-\nrequisite for initiation of proceedings. The definition\nof the term 'complaint' contained in Section 2(d)\nalso makes this evident. Thus, initiation of\nproceedings in criminal law can only be upon taking\ncognizance. It is clear, therefore, that under Section\n468 of the Cr.P.C. legislature has barred taking of\ncognizance as envisaged by Chapters XIV and XV D\nafter expiry of period of limitation. Hence, the date\nfor purpose of limitation would be the date of taking\ncognizance. Mere filing of a complaint does not\nresult in cognizance being taken, for the law\nrequires the court to apply its mind judicially even E\nbefore deciding to issue process.\nThere was no period of limitation under the old\nCr.P.C. A long delay led to serious negligence on\nthe part of the prosecuting agencies, forgetfulness F\non the part of the prosecution and defence witness\nand mental anguish to the accused. Infliction of\npunishment long after the commission of offence\nimpairs its utility as social retribution to the offender.\nTo obviate these lacunae Chapter XXXVI was\nintroduced in the Cr.P.C.\nBharat Kale and Japani Sahoo have missed the\nobject of introduction of Chapter XXXVI in the\nCr.P.C. namely to serve larger interest of\nG\nH\nA\nB\nC\nD\n696\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\ni.\nE j.\nF\nG\n[2013] 12 S.C.R.\nadministration of criminal justice keeping in view\nthe interest of the accused and the interest of\nprosecuting agencies. These judgments fail to\nadvert to the prejudice that will be caused to the\naccused if benefit of delay in taking cognizance is\nnot given to them. The likelihood of prejudice being\ncaused to the complainant which weighed with this\ncourt in the above two decisions can be taken care\nof by Section 473 which provides for condonation\nof delay.

In all these provisions period of limitation\nhas been expressly provided by the legislature. The\nlanguage of each of these provisions is different\nfrom language of Section 468. A perusal of these\nseven exceptions show that what is intended in\nSection 468 of the Cr.P.C. is limitation for taking\ncognizance and not for filing complaints.\n6.

The legislature has been very specific wherever\ntime limit has to be fixed for initiation of prosecution.\nIn certain special legislations like the Negotiable\nInstruments Act bar of limitation is not co-related to B\ntaking cognizance of an offence by a court, but it is\nco-related to filing of a complaint within a specific.\nperiod. It is apparent that the bar under Chapter.\nXXXVI of the Cr.P.C. must be co-related to taking\ncognizance of an offence by the court in view of\nspecific language used by the relevant sections\ncontained therein.\nb.\nC.\nd.\nC\nChapter XXXVI of the Cr.P.C. is captioned as\n'Limitation for Taking Cognizance of Certain\nOffences'. Therefore, this Chapter has to be D\nunderstood as a Chapter placing limitation upon the\ncourt for the purposes of taking cognizance within\nthe timeframe prescribed and not for filing of a\ncomplaint. In this Chapter the word 'complaint' or\n'complainant' are conspicuously absent. Emphasis E\nis on 'offences'.\nSection 473 of the Cr.P.C enjoins a duty on the\ncourt to examine not only whether the delay has\nbeen explained or not but whether it is necessary\nto do so in the interest of justice.\nF\nIf the charge-sheet is hit by Section 468, the Court\nmay then resort to Section 473 in exceptional cases\nin the interest of justice. The same consideration\nmay not arise if a private complaint is filed. Section G\n473 is designed to cater to situations when for\ngenuine reasons investigation is delayed.

It specifically targets\ncognizance and it debars taking cognizance of an\noffence after expiration of the statutory period of\nlimitation. One cannot make fundamental alteration\nin the words of the statute. Taking cognizance\ncannot be altered to filing complaint within statutory\nperiod.\nTaking cognizance is distinct from filing complaint.\nThe term cognizance has been defined by this Court\nin R.R. Chari and Darshan Singh Ram Kishan v.\nState of Maharashtra 18. Cognizance takes place\nwhen a Magistrate first takes judicial notice of an\noffence on a complaint, or on a police report or\nupon information of a person other than a police\nofficer.\nOperation of legal maxims can be excluded by\nstatutes but operation of statutes cannot be\nexcluded by legal maxims.

[A.R. Antulay v. R.S.\nNayak 25 (\"Antulay '1992' Case\")] Therefore, it is the\nduty of the courts to take cognizance within a\nprescribed timeframe. If the court fails to do so, it\nis not open to it to take cognizance of such offence\nas it might prejudice the right of the accused.\nTherefore, no cognizance can be taken after the\nperiod of limitation.

To\nunderstand the scheme of this Chapter reference\nmay be made to Vanka Radhamanohari.\nOn interpretation of Section 473 of the Cr.P.C\nparticularly the disjunctive 'or' used therein\nreference may be made to Municipal Corporation\nof Delhi v. Tek Chand Bhatia.31 Once the\ncomplainant has acted with due diligence and there\nare delays on the part of the Court, it would be in\nthe interest of justice to condone such delay and not\ncall for explanation from the complainant which in\nany case he cannot possibly give. On condonation\nof delay reference may be made to Sharadchandra\nDongre.\nTaking cognizance is not dictated by the\nprosecution of the complaint or police report but is\npredicated upon application of judicial mind by the\nMagistrate which is not in the control of the\nindividual instituting the prosecution.
