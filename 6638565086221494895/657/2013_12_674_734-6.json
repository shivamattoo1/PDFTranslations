In view of the above, we hold that for the purpose of\ncomputing the period of limitation under Section 468 of the\nCr.P.C. the relevant date is the date of filing of the complaint\nor the date of institution of prosecution and not the date on\nwhich the Magistrate takes cognizance. We further hold that\nB Bharat Kale which is followed in Japani Sahoo lays down the\nC\ncorrect law. Krishna Pillai will have to be restricted to its own\nfacts and it is not the authority for deciding the question as to\nwhat is the relevant date for the purpose of computing the\nperiod of limitation under Section 468 of the Cr.P.C.\n42. The Reference is answered accordingly. The Registry\nmay list the matters before the appropriate courts for disposal.\nReference answered.\nR.P.\n"}
