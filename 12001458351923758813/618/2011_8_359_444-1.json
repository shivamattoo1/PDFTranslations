Therefore, the private property cannot A\nbe acquired for such purpose by invoking the\nurgency provision contained in Section 17(1).

In the instant case, upon receipt of proposal from\nthe Development Authority, the State Government issued\ndirections to the concerned authorities to take action for D\nthe acquisition of land in different villages. The comments/\ncertificate signed by three officers, which was submitted\nin the context of Government Order dated 21.12.2006 was\naccompanied by several documents including proposal\nfor the acquisition of land, preliminary inquiry report E\nsubmitted by the Amin, Land Acquisition, copies of\nkhasra khatauni and lay out plan, 10 per cent of the\nestimated compensation and a host of other documents.\nIn the note dated nil jointly signed by Deputy Chief\nExecutive Officer, Greater Noida, Collector, Gautam Budh\nNagar and four other officers/officials, the following\nfactors were cited in justification of invoking the urgency\nprovisions: (a) The area was notified under Uttar Pradesh\nIndustrial Areas Development Act, 1976 for planned\nindustrial development; (b) If there is any delay in the\nacquisition of land then the same is likely to be\nencroached and that will adversely affect the concept of\nplanned industrial development of the district; (c) Large\ntracts of land of the nearby villages have already been\nacquired and in respect of some villages, the acquisition\nF\nH\nC\nD\n370 SUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2011] 8 S.C.R.\nA proceedings are under progress; (d) the Development\nAuthority urgently requires land for overall development,\ni.e. construction of roads, laying of sewerages, providing\nelectricity, etc. in the area; (e) the development scheme\nhas been duly approved by the State Government but the\nB work has been stalled due to non-acquisition of land; (f)\nNumerous reputed and leading industrial units of the\ncountry want to invest in the State of Uttar Pradesh and,\ntherefore, it is extremely urgent and necessary that land\nis acquired immediately; (g) If land is not made available\nto the incoming leading and reputed industrial concerns\nof the country, then they will definitely establish their\nunits in other States and if this happens, then it will\nadversely affect employment opportunities in the State\nand will also go against the investment policy of the\nGovernment; (h) If written/oral objections are invited from\nthe farmers and are scrutinized, then it will take\nunprecedented long time and disposal thereof will\nhamper planned development of the area and (i) as per\nthe provisions of the Act, there shall be at least one year's\ntime gap between publication of the notifications under\nSections 4 and 17 and Section 6. In the considered view\nof this Court, the above noted factors do not furnish\nlegally acceptable justification for the exercise of power\nby the State Government under Section 17(1) because\nthe acquisition is primarily meant to cater private interest\nin the name of industrial development of the district. It is\nneither the pleaded case of the respondents nor any\nevidence has been produced before the Court to show\nthat the State Government and/or agencies/\ninstrumentalities of the State are intending to establish\nG industrial units on the acquired land either by itself or\nthrough its agencies/instrumentalities. The respondents\nhave justified the invoking of urgency provisions by\nmaking assertions, which are usually made in such cases\nby the executive authorities i.e. the inflow of funds in the\nH State in the form of investment by private entrepreneurs\nE\nF\nSRI RADHY SHYAM (D) THROUGH LRS. \u0026 ORS. v. 371\nSTATE OF U.P. \u0026 ORS.\nand availability of larger employment opportunities to the A\npeople of the area. However, this Court does not find any\nplausible reason to accept this tailor-made justification for\napproving the impugned action which has resulted in\ndepriving the appellants' of their constitutional right to\nproperty. Even if planned industrial development of the B\ndistrict is treated as public purpose within the meaning\nof Section 4, there was no urgency which could justify\nthe exercise of power by the State Government under\nSection 17(1) and 17(4). The objective of industrial\ndevelopment of an area cannot be achieved by pressing C\nsome buttons on computer screen. It needs lot of\ndeliberations and planning keeping in view various\nscientific and technical parameters and environmental\nconcerns. The private entrepreneurs, who are desirous\nof making investment in the State, take their own time in\nD\nsetting up the industrial units. Usually, the State\nGovernment and its agencies/ instrumentalities would\ngive them two to three years' to put up their factories,\nestablishments etc. Therefore, time required for ensuring\ncompliance of the provisions contained in Section 5-A\ncannot, by any stretch of imagination, be portrayed as\ndelay which will frustrate the purpose of acquisition. In\nthis context, it is apposite to note that the time limit for\nfiling objection under Section 5-A (1) is only 30 days from\nthe date of publication of the notification under Section\n4(1). Of course, in terms of sub-section (2), the Collector\nis required to give opportunity of hearing to the objector\nand submit report to the Government after making such\nfurther inquiry, as he thinks necessary. This procedure\nis likely to consume some time, but as has been well\nsaid, \"Principles of natural justice are to some minds G\nburdensome but this price-a small price indeed-has to be\npaid if we desire a society governed by the rule of law.\"\n[Paras 54, 55] [439-D-H; 440-A-H; 441-A-H; 441-A-H; 442-\nA-B]\nE\nF\nLL\nH\nA\nB\nC\nD\n372 SUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2011] 8 S.C.R.\n2.3. In this case, the Development Authority sent\nproposal some time in 2006. The authorities up to the level\nof the Commissioner completed the exercise of survey\nand preparation of documents by the end of December,\n2006 but it took one year and almost three months to the\nState Government to issue notification under Section 4\nread with Section 17(1) and 17(4). If this much time was\nconsumed between the receipt of proposal for the\nacquisition of land and issue of notification, it is not\npossible to accept the argument that four to five weeks\nwithin which the objections could be filed under sub-\nsection (1) of Section 5-A and the time spent by the\nCollector in making inquiry under sub-section (2) of\nSection 5-A would have defeated the object of\nacquisition. [Para 56] [442-C-E]\n2.4. The apprehension of the respondents that delay\nin the acquisition of land will lead to enormous\nencroachment is totally unfounded. It is beyond the\ncomprehension of any person of ordinary prudence to\nthink that the land owners would encroach their own\nE land with a view to frustrate the concept of planned\nindustrial development of the district. The perception of\nthe respondents that there should be atleast one year's\ntime gap between the issue of notifications under\nSections 4 and 6 is clearly misconceived. The time limit\nof one year specified in clause (ii) of the proviso to\nSection 6(1) is the outer limit for issue of declaration. This\nnecessarily means that the State Government can\ncomplete the exercise under Sections 5-A and 6 in a\nshorter period. There was no real and substantive\nG urgency which could justify invoking of the urgency\nprovision under Section 17(1) and in any case, there was\nno warrant to exclude the application of Section 5-A\nwhich, as mentioned above, represent the statutory\nembodiment of the rule of audi alteram partem. [Paras 57,\n58 and 59] [442-F-H; 443-A-B]\nF\nH\n.\nSRI RADHY SHYAM (D) THROUGH LRS. \u0026 ORS. v. 373\nSTATE OF U.P. \u0026 ORS.\nA\n2.5. There is also merit in the appellants' plea that the\nacquisition of their land is vitiated due to violation of the\ndoctrine of equality enshrined in Article 14 of the\nConstitution. A reading of the survey report shows that\nthe committee constituted by the State Government had\nrecommended release of land measuring 18.9725 B\nhectares. Many parcels of land were released from\nacquisition because the land owners had already raised\nconstructions and were using the same as dwelling\nunits. A large chunk of land measuring 4.3840 hectares\nwas not acquired apparently because the same belong C\nto an ex-member of the legislative assembly. The\nappellants had also raised constructions on their land\nand were using the same for residential and agricultural\npurposes. Why their land was not left out from acquisition\nhas not been explained in the counter affidavit filed by\nthe respondents. The High Court should have treated this\nas sufficient for recording a finding that the respondents\nhad adopted the policy of pick and choose in acquiring\nsome parcels of land and this amounted to violation of\nArticle 14 of the Constitution. [Para 60] [443-C-F]\nD\nE\n2.6. The argument of the respondents that the Court\nmay not annul the impugned acquisition because land of\nother villages had already been acquired and other land\nowners have not come forward to challenge the\nacquisition of their land cannot be entertained and the F\nCourt cannot refuse to protect the legal and\nconstitutional rights of the appellants merely because the\nothers have not come forward to challenge the illegitimate\nexercise of power by the State Government. It is quite\npossible that others may have, due to sheer poverty, G\nignorance and similar handicaps not been able to avail\nlegal remedies for protection of their rights, but that\ncannot be made basis to deny what is due to the\nappellants.
