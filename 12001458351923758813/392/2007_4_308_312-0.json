ARIJIT PASAYAT AND LOKESHWAR SINGH PANTA, JJ.]\nC\nPractice and Procedure-Listing of contempt matters in High Court-\nBefore the Judges whose orders have been violated or before the Judges\nhaving provision to dispose of the matter-Held: Contempt Cases are to be\nlisted before the Judges whose orders have been violated or before whom\nundertaking was given of which wilful breach was committed-Part-heard\nmatter should not be transferred to another Bench or Single Judge-Chief\nJustice of High Court through has power to transfer part-heard case but\nshould be exercised in exceptional cases-Contempt of Court Rules, 1980-\nD Rules 12 and 15.\nE\nF\nG\nH\nLetter Patent Appeals were filed against the decision of Single Judge\nof High Court in a contempt case. The Chief Justice of High Court issued a\nNotice dated 04.08.2003 that the contempt cases arising from orders in the\nmain cases or in the miscellaneous petitions would be posted before the Single\nJudge or the Division Bench having the provision to dispose of the main\nproceedings as per the roster. The Division Bench of High Court held that\nthe direction given by the Chief Justice not to post contempt case before the\nJudges whose orders have been violated but before Judges who are having\nprovision to dispose of the matter was contrary to the Rules of the Contempt\nof Court Rules, 1980. It directed the Registry to post contempt case filed either\nby the aggrieved person or initiated by the Court in exercise of suo motu\npowers before Judges in respect of whose judgment the contempt is alleged\nor the Judges who initiated the contempt proceedings under Rules 12 and 15\nof the Contempt Rules. Hence the present appeal.\nDuring pendency of the appeal, High Court issued a Circular dated\n06.01.2007 that Contempt Cases arising from orders in the main cases or in\nthe Miscellaneous Petitions would be posted before Judges in respect of whose\njudgment the contempt is alleged or before whom an undertaking was given\nin respect of which wilful breach was committed; and that the earlier Notice\n308\nHIGH COURT OF A.P. v. SPL. DEPUTY COLLECTOR (LA) A. P. [PASAYAT, J.] 309\ndated 04.08.2003 is withdrawn forthwith.\nDisposing of the appeal, the Court\nA\nHELD: In view of the circular dated 06.01.2007 the confusion seems to\nhave cleared. At this juncture, it is to be noted that where the matter is heard\nin part, normally it should not be transferred to another Bench or Single B\nJudge. But it has come to notice in several instances that cases have been\nnoted to be part-heard even when it was really not so. Such practice is to be\ndiscouraged. The Chief Justice of the High Court has power even to transfer\na part-heard case from one Bench to another or from one Single Judge to\nanother. But this should be done in exceptional cases for special reasons.\n[Para 5] [312-B-C]\nCIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION : Civil Appeal No. 4662 of 2004.\nFrom the Final Judgment and Order dated 24.9.2003 of the High Court\nof Judicature of Andhra Pradesh at Hyderabad in L.P.A. No. 184 of 2002.\nR. Sundervardhan, T.V. Ratam, Manoj Saxena, Rajnish Kr. Singh, Rahul\nShukla and T.V. George for the Appellant.\nA. Subba Rao for the Respondent.\nVenkateshwara Rao Anumolu for the Intervenor.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nC\nD\nE\nDR. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. 1. Challenge in this appeal is to the order\npassed by the Division Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in a Letters\nPatent Appeal Nos. 184-85/2002. The two Letters Patent Appeals were directed F\nagainst the common judgment of the learned Single Judge dated 11.9.2002 in\nCC No.493/01 and CC No. 1211/01. By said order learned Single Judge recorded\na finding that the Government of Andhra Pradesh deliberately violated the\norders passed by the Court in Writ Petitions Nos. 6511 and 6513 of 1999. It\nwas held that the respondent in CC 185/2002 had filed a wrong sworn affidavit\nin Writ Petition 6513/99 for which he is liable for perjury apart from other\nconsequences. But the learned Judge took a lenient view in the matter after\nconsidering several factors including the unconditional apology. During the\nhearing of the Letters Patent Appeal one of the issues which came for\nconsideration was whether instructions of the High Court in the matter listing\nG\nH\nB\n310\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 4 S.C.R.\nA of the contempt matters were complied with. The Division Bench by the\nimpugned order held that the Chief Justice had the authority in fixing the\nroster and allot work to the brother Judges. But the direction given by the\nChief Justice not to post contempt case before the learned Judges whose\norders have been violated but before Judges who are having provision to\ndispose of the matter runs counter to the rules of the Contempt of Court\nRules, 1980 (in short the 'Contempt Rules') framed by the High Court under\nSection 23. of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 (in short the 'Contempt Act')\nread with Articles 215 and 227 of the Constitution of India, 1950 (in short the\n‘Constitution') and Section 129 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. Hence\nit was directed that Registry to post contempt case filed either by the aggrieved\nC person or initiated by the Court in exercise of suo motu powers before Judge\nor Judges in respect of whose judgment the contempt is alleged or the Judge\nor Judges who initiated the contempt proceedings as contemplated under\nRules 12 and 15 of the Contempt Rules.\n2. The High Court of Andhra Pradesh has filed the appeal in question.\nD Andhra Pradesh High Court Advocates' Association has been impleaded by\norders of this Court. Learned counsel for the appellant and the Andhra\nPradesh High Court Advocates' Association submitted that the matter is\nhaving serious implications and this Court should lay down the norms.\nE\nF\nG\n☐ H\n3. The primary grievance seems to be transfer of the cases which were\ncoming for hearing under the captions \"CAV\", \"for judgment\" and \"for\npronouncement of judgments\". The following orders need to be quoted. They\nare as follows:\n\"(A) Note to be printed in the Weekly Cause List dated 4.8.2003 at the\nend of the sitting provision of the Hon'ble Judges.\nTr\n\"Contempt cases (Admission and final hearing) arising from orders\nin the main cases or in the miscellaneous petitions will be posted\nbefore the Hon'ble Single Bench or the Division Bench having\nthe provision to dispose of the main proceedings as per the\nroster, as the case may be.\"\n(B) \"Clarification\nIn pursuance of the instructions of the Hon'ble the Chief Justice the\nfollowing note was printed in the Weekly Cause List dated 21st July,\n2003.\nHIGH COURT OF A.P. v. SPL. DEPUTY COLLECTOR (LA) A. P. [PASAYAT, J.] 311\n\"All matters under various captions including \"for Judgment\" A.\nstand released from the Benches not having the subject on its\nroster and will be posted before the concerned Benches having\nthe said subject on its roster\".\nI am further instructed to clarify that those proceedings where the\njudgments are reserved under the caption \"CAV\" will not come under B\nthe purview of the caption \"for judgment\" of the above note. Soon\nafter receiving the Court slips either from the Court Officers or the\nPersonal Secretaries to the Hon'ble Judges, where the cases are\nreserved for judgment, such proceedings will find place in the Cause\nList under the caption \"for pronouncement of judgment\" on the day C\nwhen judgment is ready and is to be pronounced. I am further\ninstructed to clarify that those matters which are coming up for hearing\nunder the caption \"for judgment\" and when the provision is not with\nthe Hon'ble Judge, such matters alone stand released.\nThe Personal Secretaries to the Hon'ble Judges are asked to place D\nthis information before the Hon'ble Judges.\"\n4. However, the controversy seems to have lost its effect in view of the\nrecent circular dated 6.1.2007 issued by the High Court. The same reads as\nunder:-\n“R.O.C. No.2/R-JUDICIAL/2007\nCIRCULAR\nE\nDATED 6.1.2007\nContempt Cases (Admission and Final hearing) arising from orders in\nthe main cases or in the Miscellaneous Petitions will be posted before F\nthe Hon'ble Single Bench or the Hon'ble Division Bench in respect\nof whose Judgment, decree, direction, order, writ or other process the\ncontempt is alleged or before whom the undertaking was given in\nrespect of which wilful breach was committed or before some other\nHon'ble Judge or Hon'ble Judges as the Hon'ble the Chief Justice\nmay direct in case the Hon'ble Judge or Hon'ble Judges concerned\nis or are not available, for preliminary hearing and for orders as to\nissue of notice to the Contemnor or Contemnors as the case may be,\nas per Rule 12 of the Contempt of Court Rules, 1980 and it is further\nnotified that the earlier Notice dated 4th August, 2003 wherein Contempt\nCases (Admission and Final hearing) arising from orders in the main\nG\nH\n312\nA\nB\nC\nD\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 4 S.C.R.\ncase or in the Miscellaneous Petitions will be posted before the\nHon'ble Single Bench or the Hon'ble Division Bench having the\nprovision to dispose of the main proceedings as per the Roster is\nwithdrawn forthwith.\nSd. REGISTRAR (JUDICIAL)\"\n5. In view of the circular dated 6.1.2007 the confusion seems to have\ncleared. At this juncture, it is to be noted that where the matter is heard in\npart, normally it should not be transferred to another Bench or learned Single\nJudge. But it has come to notice in several instances that cases have been\nnoted to be part-heard even when it was really not so. Such practice is to be\ndiscouraged. The Chief Justice of the High Court has power even to transfer\na part-heard case from Bench to another or from one learned Single Judge to\nanother. But this should be done in exceptional cases for special reasons.\nN.J.\n6. The appeal is accordingly disposed of with no order as to costs.\nAppeal disposed of.\ni\n༥\nふ\n"}
