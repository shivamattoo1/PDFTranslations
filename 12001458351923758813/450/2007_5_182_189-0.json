The requisite educational qualification was B.Sc. Zoology with other\nqualifications. First respondent, holding degree of B.Sc. (Hons.) in Chemistry\nwith Zoology and Botany, Chemistry being the principal/main subject and\nZoology and Botany as subsidiary/optional subjects, applied for the post.\nThough she did not possess the requisite qualifications of B.Sc. Zoology, the\nappellant issued her Interview letter. On scrutiny of the mark-sheet, it was\nfound that the respondent did not have Hons. Degree in Zoology and was not\neligible for the post. When she appeared for the interview, her candidature\nwas cancelled. Respondent made a representation. Appellant constituted an\nExpert Committee which submitted its Report that a student will be considered\nGa Graduate in the subject only if he/she has obtained the Degree in that subject\nF\nH\nat the Graduate level and if subject is subsidiary (or side subject) hc/she could\nnot be called graduate in that subject and as such the first respondent was\nfound to be ineligible and the cancellation was correct. First respondent filed\na writ petition which was dismissed. However, Division Bench of High Court\n182\nBIHAR PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION v. KAMINI\nallowed the Letters Patent Appeal. Hence the present appeal.\nAllowing the appeal, the Court\n183\nA\nHELD: 1.1. The advertisement is explicitly clear and states that the\ncandidate must be Honours in B.Sc. Zoology. In pursuance of the\nadvertisement, which was clear, the first respondent was not eligible for the B\nappointment to the post of District Fisheries Officer. Inspite of that, she applied\nfor the said post. Initially a letter was issued by the Commission calling upon\nher to appear before the Commission for interview. However, it was a mistake\non the part of the Commission. As soon as the Commission realized that the\nfirst respondent was not having requisite qualifications for the post and was\nnot eligible, her candidature was rejected. When a representation was made\nby the first respondent that cancellation of her candidature was not proper\nand that the decision should be reconsidered by the Commission, the\nCommission thought it fit to look into her grievance and an Expert Committee\nwas appointed. [Para 7] [187-D-F]\nC\nᎠ\n1.2. In the field of education, a Court of Law cannot act as an expert.\nNormally, therefore, whether or not a student/candidate possesses requisite\nqualifications should better be left to educational institutions. This is\nparticularly so when it is supported by an Expert Committee. The Expert\nCommittee considered the matter and observed that a person can be said to be\nHonours in the subject if at the Graduate level, he/she studies such subject E\nas the principal subject having eight papers and not a subsidiary, optional or\nside subject having two papers. Such a decision, cannot be termed arbitrary\nor otherwise objectionable. It cannot be said to be contrary to law. Single Judge\nof High Court was right in dismissing the petition relying upon the Report of\nthe Committee and in upholding the objection of the Commission. Division F\nBench was in error in ignoring the well considered report of the Expert\nCommittee and in setting aside the decision of the Single Judge.\n[Paras 7 and 8] [188-A-B; 187-G-H; 188-G]\n1.3. The Division Bench of High Court while allowing the appeal,\nobserved that on the basis of the 'litmus test' admission was granted to the G\nfirst respondent by the Central Institute of Fisheries Education, Mumbai.\nAccording to the Division Bench, if the first respondent did not possess\nBachelor of Science Degree with Zoology, the Institute would not have admitted\nher to the said course. Division Bench observed that not only the first\nrespondent was admitted to the said course, she had passed it with “flying\nH\n184\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 5 S.C.R.\nA colours\". Division Bench was not right in applying 'litmus test' of admission\nof the first respondent by Central Institute of Fisheries Education. The\ncontroversy before the Court was whether the first respondent was eligible\nfor the post of District Fisheries Officer, Class II. Therefore, the correct test\nwas not admission by Mumbai Institution. If the requirement was of Honours\nin B.Sc. with Zoology and if the first respondent had cleared B.Sc. Honours\nB\nwith Chemistry, it could not be said that she was eligible to the post having\nrequisite educational qualifications. Therefore, by not treating her eligible\nthe Commission had not committed and illegality. [Para 8] [188-C-F]\nUniversity of Mysore v. Govinda Rao, [1964] 4 SCR 576; AIR (1965)\nC SC 591, referred to.\n2.1. The Letters Patent Appeal was not allowed by the Division Bench\nof the High Court on the ground that two similarly situated persons had been\nappointed in year 1993 though they had similar qualifications. Even otherwise,\nappellant-Commission was right in submitting that the cases related to remote\nD past in 1993. He further stated that the advertisement was issued in 1999,\nseveral other candidates who had not obtained Degree of B.Sc. (Honours) with\nZoology as principal subject had applied and all of them have been treated\nineligible and were not called for interview. [Para 9] [188-G-H]\n2.2. Even if in 1993, some ineligible candidates were wrongly treated\nE as eligible, the first respondent cannot insist that she also must be treated\neligible though she is ineligible. Such an action cannot give rise to equality\nclause enshrined by Article 14 of the Constitution. Misconstruction of a\nprovision of law in one case does not give rise to a similar misconstruction in\nother cases on the basis of doctrine of equality. An illegality cannot be allowed\nto be perpetuated under the so-called 'equality doctrine'. That is not the sweep\nof Article 14. [Para 10] [189-A-B]\nF\nG\nCIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No.1970 of 2007.\nFrom the Judgment and Order dated 13.05.2003 of the High Court of\nJudicature at Patna in L.P.A. No. 381 of 2003.\nLakshmi Raman Singh, Nilam Singh and Chandra Prakash for the\nAppellants.\nVishwajit Singh, Gopal Singh, Mohit Saha and Anukul Raj for the\nH Respondents.\nН\nBIHAR PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION 1. KAMINI (C.K. THAKKER, J.]\n185\nThe Judgments of the Court was delivered by\nA\nC.K. THAKKER, J. 1. Leave granted.\n2. This appeal is filed against the judgment rendered by a Division\nBench of the High Court of Judicature at Patna on May 13, 2003 in Letters\nPatent Appeal No. 381 of 2003. By the said judgment, the Division Bench B\nallowed the appeal filed by the respondent herein-original petitioner and set\naside the judgment of the learned Single Judge, dated April 1, 2003 in CWJC\nNo. 12618 of 2002.\nD\n3. Necessary facts leading to the filing of present appeal by the Bihar\nPublic Service Commission ('Commission' for short) are that the first C\nrespondent Miss Kamini, passed her B.Sc. (Hons.) in the year 1989 in Chemistry\nwith Zoology and Botany in First Class from Tilka Manghi Bhagalpur\nUniversity in the State of Bihar. Her principal/main subject in B.Sc. Degree\nwas Chemistry, alongwith Zoology and Botany as subsidiary/optional subjects.\nAn advertisement was issued on December 21, 1999 by the Commission\ninviting applications from eligible candidates for appointment to the post of\nDistrict Fisheries Officer-cum-Chief Executive Officer in the pay scale of\nRs.6500-10500/- in the Bihar Fisheries Service Class-II. It was stated there in\nthat the candidate must have qualifications of B.Sc. Zoology with a two years\nDiploma in Fisheries Science from Central Institute of Fisheries Education,\nMumbai or a Graduate Degree in Fisheries Science (B.F.S.C.) from a recognized E\nUniversity or M.Sc. (Inland Fisheries Administration \u0026 Management) with\nZoology from the Central Institute of Fisheries Education, Mumbai. Though\nthe first respondent was not eligible as she did not possess the requisite\nqualifications of B.Sc.-Zoology, inadvertently, a letter was issued by the\nCommission on October 17, 2002 calling upon her to appear before the Interview\nBoard on November 5/6, 2002. On closure scrutiny of the mark-sheet, however,\nit was found that she was not having Hons. Degree in Zoology and was not\neligible for the post. On 5th November, 2002, therefore, when she appeared\nfor the interview, she was informed that she was not possessing requisite\neducational qualifications and her candidature had been rejected. She made\na representation on November 6, 2002 to the Chairman of the Commission to G\nreconsider the decision of cancellation of her candidature. Since there were\nsome cases of this nature, an Expert Committee was constituted by the\nCommission to consider a question whether a student can be called a Graduate\nin Zoology subject if he/she has cleared the Degree Examination with Zoology\nas a subsidiary/optional subject and not the principal subject. The Committee\nF\nH\n186\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 5 S.C.R.\nA submitted its Report on November 24, 2002. As per the said Report, a student\nwill be considered a Graduate in the subject if he/she has obtained the Degree\nin that subject at the Graduate level. The first respondent, as per the said\nreport, was found ineligible. Her cancellation was, therefore, held proper.\nB\nC\n4. The first respondent was not satisfied with the Report of the Expert\nCommittee and challenged the said decision by filing a writ petition in the\nHigh Court of Judicature at Patna. The learned single Judge dismissed the\npetition but the Letters Patent Appeal was allowed by the High Court. The\nCommission has challenged the said decision of the Division Bench.\n5. The learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the Division\nBench of the High Court was wholly wrong in allowing the appeal and in\nsetting aside the order passed by the learned Single Judge and in ignoring\nthe Report submitted by the Expert Committee. He also submitted that even\notherwise, the action of the Commission could not be said to be illegal or\ncontrary to law. When the requisite educational qualification was B.Sc. Zoology,\nD such person must have passed B.Sc. with Zoology as principal/main subject\nand not as a subsidiary or optional subject. Admittedly, the first respondent\nhad passed B.Sc. with Chemistry as principal subject and Zoology as optional/\nsubsidiary subject. She, therefore, could not be held qualified and the action\nof the Commission was in consonance with law and was legal and proper. It\nwas also submitted that after the representation was received from the first\nE\nrespondent, the Commission constituted an Expert Committee for considering\nthe grievance of the first respondent and even the Expert Committee opined\nthat in its opinion i.e. in the opinion of the Committee, a student would be\ncalled Graduate in the subject if he/she has Honours in that subject at the\nGraduate level. If the subject is subsidiary (or side subject), he/she could not\nF be called a Graduate in that subject. It was because a Honours student at the\nGraduate level studies eight papers in that subject whereas he/she studies\nonly two papers in subsidiary subject. In accordance with the Report, the\naction was taken which was proper. The counsel also submitted that the\nlearned Single Judge was wholly right in upholding the contention of the\nUniversity that the first respondent could not be said to be B.Sc. Honours\nZoology and dismissed the petition. The Division Bench was in error in\nsetting aside the said order which deserves interference.\nG\nH\n6. The learned counsel for the first respondent, on the other hand,\nsupported the order passed by the Division Bench. He submitted that the first\nrespondent was eligible and possessed requisite educational qualifications. It\nBIHAR PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION v. KAMINI [C.K. THAKKER, J.]\n187\nB\nwas because of her eligibility that she applied for the post of District Fisheries A\nOfficer. Even the Commission was satisfied about her qualifications and was\nasked to appear for interview. The counsel also submitted that the Division\nBench was right in observing that the first respondent was granted admission\nby the Central Institute of Fisheries Education, Mumbai. Had the first\nrespondent not possessed a Bachelor of Science Degree with Zoology, the\ninstitute would not have given her admission. It was, therefore, clear that the\nfirst respondent was treated as B.Sc. with Zoology, she applied to Central\nInstitute of Fisheries Education, Mumbai, she was admitted in the Institute\nand also cleared the course. It was also asserted in the counter affidavit filed\nin this Court by the first respondent (original petitioner) that two similarly\nsituated persons, namely, i) Jai Prakash, and (ii) Shailendra Kumar had been C\nappointed in the year 1993 though they had similar qualifications. It was,\ntherefore, submitted that the Division Bench was right in issuing necessary\ndirections and the appeal deserves to be dismissed.\n7. Having heard learned counsel for the parties, in our opinion, the\nappeal deserves to be allowed. The advertisement is explicitly clear and states D\nthat the candidate must be Honours in B.Sc. Zoology. It is not in dispute that\nfirst respondent has obtained B.Sc. Degree with First Class but her main\nsubject was Chemistry of eight papers of 800 marks and in addition to\nChemistry, she had two papers of Zoology and Botany. In pursuance of the\nadvertisement, which was clear, the first respondent was not eligible for the E\nappointment to the post of District Fisheries Officer. In spite of that, she\napplied for the said post. True it is that initially a letter was issued by the\nCommission on October 17, 2002 calling upon her to appear before the\nCommission for interview. It was, however, a mistake on the part of the\nCommission. As soon as the appellant-Commission realised that the first\nrespondent was not having requisite qualifications for the post and was not F\neligible, her candidature was rejected. When a representation was made by\nthe first respondent that cancellation of her candidature was not proper and\nthat the decision should be reconsidered by the Commission, the Commission\nthought it fit to look into her grievance and an Expert Committee was appointed.\nThe Expert Committee considered the question and submitted a report on\nNovember 24, 2002, inter alia, stating that in its 'considered opinion', a\nstudent would be called a Graduate in the subject if he/she has Honours in\nthe subject at the Graduate level, meaning thereby that it must be the principal\nsubject. In our opinion, such a decision could not be said to be contrary to\nlaw.\nG\nH\nA\nB\n188\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 5 S.C.R.\n8. Again, it is well settled that in the field of education, a Court of Law\ncannot act as an expert. Normally, therefore, whether or not a student/candidate\npossesses requisite qualifications should better be left to educational\ninstitutions vide University of Mysore v. Govinda Rao, [1964] 4 SCR 576 : AIR\n(1965) SC 591. This is particularly so when it is supported by an Expert\nCommittee. The Expert Committee considered the matter and observed that a\nperson can be said to be Honours in the subject if at the Graduate level, he/\nshe studies such subject as the principal subject having eight papers and not\na subsidiary, optional or side subject having two papers. Such a decision, in\nour judgment, cannot be termed arbitrary or otherwise objectionable. The\nlearned Single Judge, in our opinion, was, therefore, right in dismissing the\nC petition relying upon the Report of the Committee and in upholding the\nobjection of the Commission. The Division Bench was in error in ignoring the\nwell considered report of the Expert Committee and in setting aside the\ndecision of the learned Single Judge. The Division Bench, while allowing the\nappeal, observed that the 'litmus test' was the admission granted to the first\nrespondent by the Central Institute of Fisheries Education, Mumbai. According\nto the Division Bench, if the first respondent did not possess Bachelor of\nScience Degree with Zoology, the Institute would not have admitted her to\nthe said course. The Division Bench observed that not only the first\nrespondent was admitted to the said course, she had passed it with \"flying\ncolours”. In our opinion, the Division Bench was not right in applying ‘litmus\nE test' of admission of the first respondent by Central Institute of Fisheries\nEducation, Mumbai. The controversy before the Court was whether the first\nrespondent was eligible for the post of District Fisheries Officer, Class II. The\ncorrect test, therefore, was not admission by Mumbai Institution. If the\nrequirement was of Honours in B.Sc. with Zoology and if the first respondent\nhad cleared B.Sc. Honours with Chemistry, it could not be said that she was\neligible to the post having requisite educational qualifications. By not treating\nher eligible, therefore, the Commission had not committed any illegality.\nD\nF\n9. With regard to two instances cited by the first respondent in her\ncounter affidavit before this Court, it is sufficient to state that the Letters\nPatent Appeal was not allowed by the Division Bench of the High Court on\nG\nthat ground. Even otherwise, the learned counsel for the appellant-Commission\nis right in submitting that the cases related to remote past in 1993. He further\nstated that the advertisement was issued in 1999, several other candidates\nwho had not obtained Degree of B.Sc. (Honours) with Zoology as principal\nsubject had applied and all of them have been treated ineligible and were not\nH called for interview.\nBIHAR PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION 1. KAMINI [C.K. THAKKER, J.]\n189\n10. In our opinion, the submission of the learned counsel for the A\nCommission is well founded and must be accepted. Therefore, even if in 1993,\nsome ineligible candidates were wrongly treated as eligible, the first respondent\ncannot insist that she also must be treated eligible though she is ineligible.\nIn our considered opinion, such an action cannot give rise to equality clause\nenshrined by Article 14 of the Constitution. It is well settled and needs no\nB\nauthority that misconstruction of a provision of law in one case does not give\nrise to a similar misconstruction in other cases on the basis of doctrine of\nequality. An illegality cannot be allowed to be perpetuated under the so-called\n'equality doctrine'. That is not the sweep of Article 14. Even that contention,\ntherefore, has not impressed us.\n11. For the foregoing reasons, the appeal deserves to be allowed and\nis accordingly allowed. The order passed by the Division Bench of the High\nCourt is set aside and the order passed by the learned Single Judge is\nrestored and the petition filed by the first respondent-original petitioner\nstands dismissed, however, with no order as to costs.\nN.J.\nC\nD\nAppeal is allowed.\n"}
