The UDRI has made various suggestions. Its trustees\ninclude Mr. Charles Correa, an eminent architect and town\nplanner, Shri Dipak Parekh an eminent economist, Shri D.M.\nSukhtankar, retired Municipal Commissioner and former\nSecretary to Government of Maharashtra and others. This\ninstitute has made a detailed study of the problems of the city.\nWith respect to issue No. 2, this institute has submitted as\nnoted above, that there should not be a blanket relaxation for\nthe high rise buildings, and it should be examined locality-wise.\nAbsence of any check in this behalf, has resulted into very tall\nbuildings with no open spaces on extremely narrow streets. It\nis often seen that whereas the ordinary FSI is 1.33, the minimum\nFSI available to the schemes under DCR 33(7), 33(8) and 33(9)\nis 2.5, and there is no upper limit. No assessment is made of D\nthe sustainable carrying capacity of the areas in which these\nprojects are implemented. There is no transport impact\nassessment on the neighbourhood in such projects. A locality-\nwise approach is therefore required.\nE\n51. In its submissions on the issues at hand, UDRI pointed\nout that whereas the total open space in Mumbai is 3.8%, if\nwe compare it with another crowded area viz. Manhattan in US,\nthere the public open space for recreation is 13.1%. The\nNational Building Code (of India) requires 3 sq. mts. per capita F\nby way of open space. However, Greater Mumbai has just 1.91\nsq. mts. of open space per person, and of this less than 0.88\nsq. mts. per person is accessible for recreation. Each\nManhattan resident occupies 11 times as much floor space as\na Mumbai resident. Doubling or trebling Mumbai's FSI will only\nmake it two or three times denser than Manhattan in regard to\nthe number of people on the ground. Consequently, the open\nspace available per person will become even less.\n52. Since the project of respondent-Kohinoor is going to\nG\nH\n1170\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2013] 16 S.C.R.\nA\nbe at a busy road junction near Shivaji Park in the Dadar area\nof Mumbai, it is pointed out by UDRI that Dadar, Mahim, and\nMatunga areas, are essentially residential areas. Various\nhousing colonies were laid out, as per the town planning\nscheme, such as Dadar Parsi Colony and Hindu Colony etc.\nB In fact, Mr. Divan pointed out that the entire area around Shivaji\nPark was laid out systematically as per the norms, for a\nspecified population, and it is like a heritage area. Requisite\nprovisions for gardens, schools, roads, foot-paths and play-\ngrounds etc., have been made for a certain density of\nC population. Now with the reconstruction schemes being\nproposed, suddenly tall buildings are coming up even near the\nschool buildings, and adding further to the density and pressure\non the existing infrastructure. The roads having been laid out\nmuch earlier, and being in proper proportion to the height of\nD the adjoining buildings, these new tall buildings coming up in\nthe very area are causing congestion and greater traffic. This\nis affecting the life of the people around and even the school\ngoing children, with increased traffic and parking on the roads.\nThe roads which were adequate at one point of time, are now\nE being found to be narrow. Plot No.46, with which we are\nconcerned, in the present matter, had a textile mill earlier, and\nnow a huge commercial complex has been approved on it. But\nfor this construction, there were no such large commercial\ncomplexes in this entire area. Earlier only those commercial\nactivities were permitted which were necessary for the use of\nthe residents. This huge commercial complex is going to add\ntremendous pressure on the traffic in the area and at an already\nbusy junction.\nF\nG\nH\nSuggestions on issue Nos. 3 and 4 for consideration\nwhen the new Development Plan is drafted:-\n53. We have noted the submissions on both these issues,\nand what we find is that the exemptions from DCR 31 (1) for\nschemes under Section 33(7), 33(8) and 33(9), though\nMUNICIPAL COPRN. OF GREATER MUMBAI v. KOHINOOR CTNL 1171\nINFRASTRUCTURE COMPANY PVT. LTD. [H.L. GOKHALE, J.]\napparently meant for laudable purpose, are very often resulting A\ninto extreme crowding, and traffic congestion. It is necessary.\nthat while granting exemptions from DCR 31(1), there must be\na scheme-wise approach, and there ought to be a proper\nsupervision of the construction. These development schemes\nand the additional FSI thereunder, should be examined locality- B\nwise. The impact of such high-rise buildings on the adjoining\nlocality as well as on the traffic, is required to be examined\nbefore granting such permission.\nC\nD\n54. In our view, there is a need to restrict the additional\npressure on existing infrastructure so that it does not affect the\nquality of life. The existing social infrastructure like educational\ninstitutions, open spaces, hospitals etc, and physical\ninfrastructure like water supply and drainage is already over-\nburdened. Therefore, wherever possible, the State Government,\nthe planning authority, and the committee entrusted with drafting\nof the new plan should consider contribution by the existing\noccupants themselves to a good extent towards the\nconstruction cost, or the State should contribute through its\nagencies or from the amount of cess-collected. This will result\ninto curtailing the number of additional entrants and will not add E\nto the density of the population. This approach should\nparticularly be examined where the plots are small or are in\ncongested areas, and particularly where the proposal is under\nDCR 33(7). The new Development Plan is to be prepared\nshortly, and while preparing the plan these aspects concerning F\nrestrictions on blanket exemptions, contribution by the existing\noccupants to the reconstruction schemes, locality-wise\nconsideration and impact of additional FSI on traffic, ought to\nbe gone into. In areas where the old town planning schemes.\nhave prescribed a uniform lay-out, one can accept some\nbuildings going up to a certain extent, if necessary, to\naccommodate the existing occupants in a reconstruction.\nscheme. However, it should not result into a plethora of steeply\nrising buildings, to accommodate outsiders to the building,\nadding to the population and traffic, and disturbing the existing H\nG\n1172 SUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2013] 16 S.C.R.\nA order of the lay-out completely.\nB\nReconstitution of the 'Technical Committee for High\nRise Buildings':-\n55. (i) It has been pointed out on behalf of the Municipal\nCorporation that subsequent to a PIL in the Bombay High Court\nin the case of Tardeo Haji Ali Residents Welfare Association,\nthe State Government has constituted a 'Technical Committee\nfor High-Rise Buildings' (i.e. Buildings exceeding 70 meters in\nheight).

The\ncomposition of the Committee has changed from time to time.\nWe are informed that the term of the existing committee, which\nis the third committee, has expired. The committee consists of\nsix members and is headed by a retired judge of the Bombay\nHigh Court, as the Chairman. It has two ex-officio members,\nnamely, the Chief Engineer (Development Plan) of the appellant\nwho is also the member secretary, and the Chief Fire Officer\nof the appellant. There are three expert members. Following are\nthe present expert members:-\n“(1) Prof R. S. Jangid, Dept of Civil Engineering, IIT\nBombay, as a Structural Engineering Expert.\nF\nG\nI\n1176\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2013] 16 S.C.R.\nA\nB\n(2) Prof. Abhay Bambole, Professor and Head of the\nStructural Engineering Department, VJIT, Matunga, as\nthe Soil and Geotech Expert.\n(3) Dr. Rakesh Kumar, Director and Gr. Scientist and\nHead NEERI Regional Centre as the Environmental\nExpert.\"\n56. It has been suggested that we appoint a new\ncommittee, though the State Government has expressed its\nwillingness to extend the term of the present committee. Mr.\nC Nariman has, in fact, suggested that the committee should\nconsist of members who will play a pro-active role. Mr. Divan\nsubmitted that it should be a Development Plan over-sight\ncommittee, and it should at-least look into the grievances with\nrespect to the schemes under 33(7), (8),(9), and (10). Mr.\nD Joaquim Reis, learned senior counsel instructing Dr. Abhishek\nSinghvi, learned senior counsel appearing for the Property\nRedevelopers Association, suggested inclusion of an architect\nin the committee. Considering that the architectural points as\nmentioned in the municipal note, are also to be gone into by\nE the committee, the suggestion is quite apt. He suggested the\nF\nG\ninclusion of eminent architect Mr. Charles Correa, who is\nassociated with UDRI (and which is represented by Mr. Divan).\nWe are, however, not including his name only for the reason.\nthat we are informed that he is a very busy architect, though\nthe committee should certainly consult him whenever necessary.\nIn his place, we include Shri Pankaj Joshi, Architect, Urban\nResearcher, and consultant to the appellant-Municipal\nCorporation, whose name is suggested by Mr. Divan. Thus, the\nassistance of an architect will also be available to the\ncommittee. Having taken the consensus of the counsel\nappearing in the matter, we are effecting one more change in\nthe committee. We appoint Hon'ble Mr. Justice P.S. Patankar,\nformer Judge of the Bombay High Court, to be the Chairman\nof the committee.\n:\nH\nMUNICIPAL COPRN. OF GREATER MUMBAI v.

A scrutiny fee for Rs 50,000 per proposal is\ncollected at the time of submission of the proposal. We have\nalready referred to the existing terms of reference. In view of\nthe discussion in this matter, in our view, it is desirable that the\nD\ncommittee be requested to look into two additional aspects\nwhich are as follows:-\n(ii) The committee will also look into the grievances\nregarding construction and technical requirements of the\nE development schemes under DCR 33(7), 33(8), 33(9) and\n33(10), whenever brought to the notice of the committee by\nconcerned persons.\n(iii) The committee may as well make recommendations\nF to the State Government with respect to the new Development\nPlan which is under drafting.\nG\n58.
