S.C.R:\n(1) Where an appeal or revision is provided against an\norder passed by a court, tribunal or any other authority\nbefore superior forum and such superior forum modifies,\nreverses or affirms the decision put in issue before it, the\ndecision by the subordinate forum merges in the decision\nby the superior forum and it is the latter which subsists,\nremains operative and is capable of enforcement in the\neye of law.\n(ii) The jurisdiction conferred by Article 136 of the\nConstitution is divisible into two stages. The first stage is\nupto the disposal of prayer for special leave to file an\nappeal. The second stage commences if and when the\nleave to appeal is granted and the special leave petition\nis converted into an appeal.\n(iii) The doctrine of merger is not a doctrine of universal\nor unlimited application. It will depend on the nature of\njurisdiction exercised by the superior forum and the content\nor subject-matter of challenge laid or capable of being laid\nshall be determinative of the applicability of merger. The\nsuperior jurisdiction should be capable of reversing,\nmodifying or affirming the order put in issue before it.\nUnder Article 136 of the Constitution the Supreme Court\nmay reverse, modify or affirm the judgment-decree or order\nappealed against while exercising its appellate jurisdiction\nand not while exercising the discretionary jurisdiction\ndisposing of petition for special leave to appeal. The\ndoctrine of merger can therefore be applied to the former\nand not to the latter.\n(iv) An order refusing special leave to appeal may be a\nnon-speaking order or a speaking one. In either case it\ndoes not attract the doctrine of merger. An order refusing\nspecial leave to appeal does not stand substituted in place\nof the order under challenge. All that it means is that the\nCourt was not inclined to exercise its discretion so as to\nallow the appeal being filed.\ni\nh\nOMPRAKASH VERMA \u0026 ORS. v. STATE OF\nANDHRA PRADESH \u0026 ORS. [P. SATHASIVAM, J.]\n343\n(v) If the order refusing leave to appeal is a speaking order, A\ni.e., gives reasons for refusing the grant of leave, then the\norder has two implications. Firstly, the statement of law\ncontained in the order is a declaration of law by the\nSupreme Court within the meaning of Article 141 of the\nConstitution. Secondly, other than the declaration of law, B\nwhatever is stated in the order are the findings recorded\nby the Supreme Court which would bind the parties thereto\nand also the court, tribunal or authority in any proceedings\nsubsequent thereto by way of judicial discipline, the\nSupreme Court being the Apex Court of the country. But, C\nthis does not amount to saying that the order of the court,\ntribunal or authority below has stood merged in the order\nof the Supreme Court rejecting the special leave petition\nor that the order of the Supreme Court is the only order\nbinding as res judicata in subsequent proceedings\nbetween the parties.\nD\n(vi) Once leave to appeal has been granted and appellate\njurisdiction of Supreme Court has been invoked the order\npassed in appeal would attract the doctrine of merger; the\norder may be of reversal, modification or merely E\naffirmation.\n(vii) On an appeal having been preferred or a petition\nseeking leave to appeal having been converted into an\nappeal before the Supreme Court the jurisdiction of High F\nCourt to entertain a review petition is lost thereafter as\nprovided by sub-rule (1) of Rule 1 of Order 47 CPC.\"\nG\n23. It is clear that once leave was granted by this Court in\nthe special leave petitions filed against the Division Bench of\nthe High Court in the earlier round of litigation and the\nconsequent civil appeals arising therefrom filed by the State\nGovernment is allowed by this Court, the judgment of the\nDivision Bench lost its identity and merged with the judgment\nof this Court. The said judgment of the Division Bench of the\nHigh Court, therefore, cannot be relied upon for any purpose H.\nC\nD\n344 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2010] 15 (ADDL.) S.C.R.\nA whatsoever. Even on merits, it is relevant to point out that the\narguments of the appellants that the lands in issue became\namenable to the ULC Act only upon extension of Master Plan\nthereto on 23.06.1980 and that the declaration made prior to\nsuch date is non est is not acceptable and sustainable. As a\nmatter of fact, the stand of the State Government has through\nout been that the lands in issue were not agricultural lands but\nwere vacant lands under the ULC Act even in 1976 when the\ndeclaration was made by the owners under Section 6 of the\nULC Act, hence the declaration and all action taken consequent\nthereto are valid in law. This position or stand of the State\nGovernment is clear and reiterated in its writ appeal filed by\nway of counter affidavit before the Division Bench of the High\nCourt and before this Court in the present proceedings. It was\nbrought to our notice that the appellants conceded before the\nHigh Court that the lands in issue were part of urban\nagglomeration even when the declaration under Section 6 of\nthe ULC Act was enforced. In addition to the same, it was also\nbrought to our notice that by an agreement dated 09.08.1974,\nthe lands in issue were sold by the owners to a society, namely,\nChanakyapuri Cooperative Housing Society which got a layout\nplan sanctioned on 20.10.1975 by Raidurg Gram Panchayat\nfor construction of houses on the said lands. These materials\nclearly show that the lands were not agricultural lands even\nprior to declaration filed under Section 6 of the ULC Act by the\nowners in 1976. Any land not being agricultural land and falling\nwithin an urban agglomeration, constitutes vacant land as\ndefined in Section 2(q) of the ULC Act. The lands in issue,\ntherefore, constitute vacant land on the date of filing of\ndeclaration under Section 6 of the ULC Act by the owners in\n1976. As per Section 6 of the ULC Act, declaration was\nG required to be filed in respect of vacant land, such declaration\nwas correctly filed by the owners hence, subsequent extension\nof master plan to the lands in issue on 23.06.1980 has no\nrelevance to the validity of the declaration made in 1976 or to\nthe proceedings initiated under the ULC Act pursuant to such\nH declaration. It is not in dispute that the proceedings under the\nE\nF\nOMPRAKASH VERMA \u0026 ORS. v. STATE OF\nANDHRA PRADESH \u0026 ORS. [P. SATHASIVAM, J.]\n345\nA\nULC Act were not challenged by the owners at any stage as\nprovided by the statute. The notification under Section 10(3)\nof the ULC Act stating that the surplus land would be deemed\nto have been acquired by the State Government and the same\nshall vest absolutely in the State Government free from all\nencumbrances was issued even as early as on 24.01.1981 B\nwhich was allowed to become final in the absence of any\nappeal being filed against such notification as provided by the\nstatute. Once vesting takes place under Section 10(3) of the\nCeiling Act, the State has absolute title and ownership over it.\nThe owner has no further say in respect of the land that has C\nvested in the State. This position has been explained by us in\nSmt. Sulochana Chandrakant Galande vs. Pune Municipal\nTransport \u0026 Ors., 2010 (7) Scale 571 as under:\n\"9. The meaning of the word `vesting' has been\nconsidered by this Court time and again. In The Fruit \u0026\nVegetable Merchants Union v. The Delhi Improvement\nTrust, AIR 1957 SC 344, this Court held that the meaning\nof word `vesting' varies as per the context of the Statute\nin which the property vests. While considering the case\nunder Sections 16 and 17 of the Act 1894, the Court held\nas under:\nD\nE\n...the property acquired becomes the property of\nGovernment without any condition or limitations\neither as to title or possession. The legislature has F\nmade it clear that vesting of the property is not for\nany limited purpose or limited duration.\"\n(Emphasis added).\n10. \"Encumbrance\" actually means the burden caused by G\nan act or omission of man and not that created by nature.\nIt means a burden or charge upon property or a claim or\nlien on the land. It means a legal liability on property. Thus,\nit constitutes a burden on the title which diminishes the\nvalue of the land. It may be a mortgage or a deed of trust H\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n346 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2010] 15 (ADDL.) S.C.R.\nor a lien of an easement. An encumbrance, thus, must be\na charge on the property. It must run with the property.\n(Vide Collector of Bombay v. Nusserwanji Rattanji Mistri\nand Ors., AIR 1955 SC 298; H.P. State Electricity Board\nand Ors. v. Shiv K. Sharma and Ors., AIR 2005 SC 954;\nand A/ Champdany Industries Ltd. v. Official Liquidator\nand Anr., (2009) 4 SCC 486).\n11. In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Tarsem Singh and\nOrs., AIR 2001 SC 3431, this Court held that the\nterminology 'free from all encumbrances' used in Section\n16 of the Act 1894, is wholly unqualified and would en-\ncompass the extinguishing of \"all rights, title and interests\nincluding easementary rights\" when the title vests in the\nState.\nThus, \"free from encumbrances\" means vesting of\nland in the State without any charge or burden in it. Thus,\nState has absolute title/ownership over it.\n12. In Satendra Prasad Jain and Ors. v. State of U.P. and\nOrs., AIR 1993 SC 2517, this Court held that once land\nvests in the State free from all encumbrances, it cannot be\ndivested. The same view has been reiterated in Awadh\nBihari Yadav and Ors. v. State of Bihar and Ors., (1995)\n6 SCC 31; U.P. Jal Nigam, Lucknow v. M/s Kalra\nProperties (P) Ltd. Lucknow and Ors., AIR 1996 SC 1170;\nPratap and Anr. (Supra); Chandragauda Ramgonda Patil\nand Anr. v. State of Maharashtra and Ors., (1996) 6 SCC\n405; Allahabad Development Authority v. Nasiruzzaman\nand Ors., (1996) 6 SCC 424; State of Kerala and Ors. v.\nM. Bhaskaran Pillai and Anr., AIR 1997 SC 2703; M.\nRamalinga Thevar v. State of Tamil Nadu and Ors.,\n(2000) 4 SCC 322; Printers (Mysore) Ltd. v. M.A.\nRasheed and Ors., (2004) 4 SCC 460; Bangalore\nDevelopment Authority and Ors., v. R. Hanumaiah and\nOrs,. (2005) 12 SCC 508; and Government of Andhra\nPradesh and Anr. v. Syed Akbar, AIR 2005 SC 492.\nOMPRAKASH VERMA \u0026 ORS. v. STATE OF\nANDHRA PRADESH \u0026 ORS. [P. SATHASIVAM, J.]\n347\n13. So far as the change of user is concerned, it is a A\nsettled legal proposition that once land vests in the State\nfree from all encumbrances, there cannot be any rider on\nthe power of the State Government to change user of the\nland in the manner it chooses.\nIn a similar situation, in Gulam Mustafa and Ors. v.\nThe State of Maharashtra and Ors., AIR 1977 SC 448,\nthis Court held as under:\nB\n\"Once the original acquisition is valid and title has\nvested in the Municipality, how it uses the excess land is C\nno concern of the original owner and cannot be the basis\nfor invalidating the acquisition. There is no principle of law\nby which a valid compulsory acquisition stands voided\nbecause long later the requiring Authority diverts it to a\npublic purpose other than the one stated in D\nthe....declaration.\"\n14. Re-iterating a similar view in C. Padma and Ors. v.\nDeputy Secretary to the Government of Tamil Nadu and\nOrs., (1997) 2 SCC 627, this Court held that if by virtue of\nE\na valid acquisition of land, land stands vested in the State,\nthereafter, claimants are not entitled to restoration of\npossession on the grounds that either the original public\npurpose is ceased to be in operation or the land could not\nbe used for any other purposes.\nF\n15. In Bhagat Singh etc. v. State of U.P. and Ors., AIR\n1999 SC 436; Niladri Narayan Chandradhurja v. State\nof West Bengal, AIR 2002 SC 2532; and Northern Indian\nGlass Industries v. Jaswant Singh and Ors., (2003) 1\nSCC 335, this Court held that, the land user can be G\nchanged by the Statutory Authority after the land vests in\nthe State free from all encumbrances.\n16. In view of the above, the law can be summarised that\nonce the land is acquired, it vests in the State free from\nH\nA\nB\nC\n348\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS [2010] 15 (ADDL.) S.C.R.\nall encumbrances. It is not the concern of the land owner\nhow his land is used and whether the land is being used\nfor the purpose for which it was acquired or for any other\npurpose. He becomes persona non grata once the land\nvests in the State. He has a right to get compensation only\nfor the same. The person interested cannot claim the right\nof restoration of land on any ground, whatsoever.\"\n24. With regard to the ultimate decision in Audikesava\nReddy's case (supra), Mr. Vahanvati, learned Attorney General\nfor India, by drawing our attention to the decree prepared by\nthe Registry submitted that there is no doubt as to setting side\nthe entire judgment of the Division Bench of the High Court and\nthe parties cannot claim that certain issues have been kept\nopen or untouched. In support of the above claim, learned\nAttorney General heavily relied on the decree drafted by the\nD Registry. The relevant portion of the decree is as follows:\nE\n៣\nF\nG\nH\n\"\nwhile holding that the Master Plan prepared as per\nlaw in force even subsequent to enforcement of the Urban\nLand (Ceiling \u0026 Regulations) Act, 1976 is to be taken into\nconsideration to determine whether a particular piece of\nland is vacant land or not, and while leaving open the\nquestion as to the consequences of filing of a statement\nby a person under a wrong impression that the vacant land\nheld by him is in excess of ceiling limit if it was not so when\nhe filed a statement, to be decided in an appropriate case\nand for the reasons recorded in its Judgment DOTH in\nallowing the appeal and the resultant appeal ORDER:\n1. THAT the Judgments and Orders dated 28th October,\n1994 and the 4th December, 1996 of the Division Bench\nof the High Court of Judicature of Andhra Pradesh at\nHyderabad in Writ Appeal Nos. 1220 and 918 of 1994\nrespectively, and also Judgments and Orders dated 6th\nOctober, 1994 and 27th July, 1994 of the Single Judge of\nthe said High Court in Writ Petition Nos. 238 of 1994 and\n18335 of 1993 be and are hereby set aside and in place\nOMPRAKASH VERMA \u0026 ORS. v.

SATHASIVAM, J.]\n349\nthereof an order dismissing Writ Petition Nos. 238 of 1994 A\nand 18335 of 1993 on the file of High Court be and is\nhereby substituted;\n2. THAT the parties herein shall bear their own costs of\nthese appeals in this Court;...\"\nMr. Chowdhary submitted that the terms of decree drawn by\nthe Registry of this Court, cannot, in law, provide any guidance\nof the interpretation of and for deducing the adjudication\ncontained in the judgment of this Court in Audikesava Reddy's\ncase having regard to the definitions of the expressions\n\"judgment and decree\" contained in Section 2(9) and Section\n2(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (hereinafter referred\nto as 'CPC') respectively, which reads thus:\nB\nC\n“2(9) “judgment\" means the statement given by the Judge D\non the grounds of a decree or order;\n2(2) “decree” means the formal expression of an\nadjudication which, so far as regards the Court expressing\nit, conclusively determines the rights of the parties with\nregard to all or any of the matters in controversy in the suit\nand may be either preliminary or final. It shall be deemed\nto include the rejection of a plaint and the determination\nof any question within section 144, but shall not include-\nE\n(a) any adjudication from which an appeal lies as an F\nappeal from an order, or\n(b) any order of dismissal for default.\nExplanation.- A decree is preliminary when further\nproceedings have to be taken before the suit can be G\ncompletely disposed of. It is final when such adjudication\ncompletely disposes of the suit. It may be partly\npreliminary and partly final;\"\nAccording to him, a combined reading of the above two H\n350 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2010] 15 (ADDL.) S.C.R.\nA definitions show that the judgment must furnish the reasons or\nC\nD\ngrounds for the adjudication of the controversy or controversies\non the basis of which only a decree can be drawn. He pointed\nout that that is the reason it is said in law that “a decree must\nfollow the judgment\" or \"a decree must agree with the judgment\".\nB Repeatedly, Mr. Chowdhuri submitted except answering the\nquestion referred to by a two-Judge Bench, this Court has not\nconsidered or concerned with the consequences of filing\ndeclarations under a wrong impression that the land is \"vacant\"\nwhen the land is not a \"vacant land\" and the same be decided\nin an appropriate case, which necessarily means that this Court\nwas not inclined to go into the three questions, namely, whether\nthe land in Survey No. 83, Raidurg (Panmaqtha) village was\nagricultural or not, whether such declarations were filed on\n16.09.1976, on a wrong impression and whether the\nproceedings under Sections 8, 9 and 10 of the ULC Act are\nvalid, having already declared in Para 13 that the date of\ncommencement of the ULC Act qua the land in Survey No. 83,\nwould be the date on which the said land was included in the\nsecond Master Plan that is, on 29.09.1980 when the owners\nwere obligated to file declarations under Section 6 of their\nholdings and as such the statutory obligation to deal with such\ndeclarations also would commence only from the date of filing\nfresh declarations after 29.09.1980 (date of commencement of\nthe Act). While winding up his reservation about the decree, he\nsubmitted that this Court in Audikesava Reddy's case (supra)\nexpressly did not go into the question of validity of the\nproceedings taken by the Competent Authority under Sections\n8, 9 and 10 of the ULC Act on the earlier declarations filed in\nSeptember, 1976 under a mis-conception or a wrong\nimpression when the land was not a \"vacant land\". As a matter\nG of fact, after making the above submissions as to the decree,\nMr. Chowdhury requested this Court to issue suo moto direction\nto the Registry for making necessary correction.\nE\nF\n25. About the decree prepared by the Registry, though as\nH per the Rules, the parties are permitted to point out error or\nOMPRAKASH VERMA \u0026 ORS. v. STATE OF\nANDHRA PRADESH \u0026 ORS. [P. SATHASIVAM, J.]\n351\ndefect, if the same is not in accordance with the decision before A\nthe official concerned. Till date, the appellants have not\nquestioned the correctness of the decree, even now, there is\nno application for its correction. On the other hand, we are of\nthe view that the decree which we have extracted in the earlier\npart of our judgment makes it clear that the allowing of the B\nappeals filed by the State in Audikesava Reddy's case clearly\nmeans that the High Court judgment is set aside and the writ\npetitions are dismissed.\nC\nD\n26. The appellants also contended that the decree must\nfollow the judgment and if it does not conform to the judgment\nthen the same can be corrected. As a matter of fact, Mr.\nChowdhary, learned senior counsel appearing for the\nappellants, made a plea for suo moto correction and reliance\nwas placed on the judgment of this Court in Lakshmi Ram\nBhuyan vs. Hari Prasad Bhuyan, (2003) 1 SCC 197. In this\ncase, the High Court had modified the order of the trial Court.\nAfter the matter came back to the trial Court, a decree was\nprepared. During execution proceedings, an objection was\nraised to the execution as the decree did not contain the relief\ngranted. The trial Court stopped execution and issued direction E\nfor correction of the decree. The matter was taken up to the\nHigh Court and finally to this Court. On perusal of the entire\nfactual details, we find that this judgment has no application to\nthe case on hand as these proceedings do not arise out of the\nproceedings for correction of decree. As observed earlier, till F\ndate, no application has been filed for correction of decree. On\nthe other hand, we have already held that in the case on hand\nthe decree is consistent with the judgment. As the High Court\nhad allowed the writ petitions only on one ground based on Atia\nBegum's case and as this Court had overruled the said G\njudgment, it was not inclined to go into the question relating to\nfiling of declaration by owners under wrong impression. The\ndirection that the appeals are allowed can have only one\nmeaning and the meaning is that the judgment of the High Court\nis set aside and the writ petitions are dismissed. In view of H\n"}
