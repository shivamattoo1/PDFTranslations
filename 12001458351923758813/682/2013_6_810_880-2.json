As previously noticed, the CEC in its Report dated\n13.3.2012 had set out in detail the objectives of the\nReclamation and Rehabilitation (R\u0026R) plans and the guidelines\nfor preparation of detailed R \u0026 R plans in respect of each mining\nlease. The origins of the idea (R \u0026 R plans) are to be found in\nan earlier Report of the CEC dated 28.7.2011. As the\nsuggestions of the CEC with regard to preparations of R \u0026 R\nplans for each mine is crucial to scientific and planned\nexploitation of the mineral resources in question it will be\nnecessary for us to notice the said objectives and the detailed\nguidelines which are set out below. In this connection it would\nbe worthwhile to take note of the fact that the guidelines in\nquestion have been prepared after detailed consultation with\ndifferent stakeholders including the Federation of Indian\nMineral Industries (FIMI) which claims to be the representative\nbody of the majority of the mining lessees of the present case.\n\"II.

PROVISIONS/PRESCRIPTIONS OF THE LEASE A\nWISE R\u0026R PLANS\n14. The leasewise R\u0026R Plans will provide for the specific\nprovisions/prescriptions as dealt with hereunder:\n(A) REGARDING AREA FOUND BY THE JOINT\nTEAM TO BE UNDER ILLEGAL MINING\n15. The area under illegal mining pits should be filled up\nwith the existing over burden/waste dumps preferably the\nillegal dumps. Appropriate soil and moisture conservation\nmeasures will be provided and such areas will be\nafforested with indigenous species.\n16. The reclamation and rehabilitation works will be carried\nout even if such areas are found to be having mineral\nreserves.\n17. In respect of area under illegal over burden/waste\ndumps, wherever environmentally feasible the over burden/\nwaste dumps will be removed and disposed of\nscientifically within the lease area of the encroacher.\n18. In other cases, the illegal over burden/waste dumps will\nbe stabilized by:\n(a) modifying the gradient of the lump\nB\nC\nD\nE\nLL\nF\n(b) construction of retaining walls,\n(c)\nconstruction of gully plugs\n(d)\nconstruction of garland drains\nG\n(e)\ngeo-metric/geo-matting of dumps\n(f)\nafforestation, and\n(g)\nother soil and moisture conservation measures,\nH\nA\n838\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2013] 6 S.C.R.\n19. However, in respect of the mining pits falling within the\narea of the other sanctioned leases, specific lease-wise\nprescription/provision will be made depending upon the\nground situation.\n(B)\nB\nREGARDING\nPERMISSIBLE\nANNUAL\nC\nD\nE\nF\n☐ G\n☐ H\nPRODUCTION\n20. The permissible annual production for the mining lease\nwould be based on (a) the mineral reserves in the lease\narea; (b) area available for over burden/waste dumps, sub\ngrade iron ore and other land uses (c) existing transport\nfacilities in relation to the traffic load of the mining lease\nand (d) overall ceiling on the annual production from all the\nmining leases in the district (as dealt with earlier).\n21. Presently the permissible annual production would be\ndecided for the next five years subject to review/\nmodification in any of the following situation:\n(a) change in the assessed mineral reserves/\nresources because of subsequent exploration\ncarried out and incorporated in the modified mining\nplan/scheme and approved by the IBM;\n(b) identification of additional area for the disposal\nof the over burden/waste dumps and incorporated\nin the approved mining plan/scheme (preferably by\nway of back filling of mined out pits); and\n(c) creation of additional physical infrastructure such\nas railway sidings, conveyors, wagon tipplers,\nwagon loaders (to remove/reduce transportation\nbottlenecks).\n(C) STABILIZATION OF THE EXISTING OVER\nBURDEN/WASTE DUMPS AND SUB GRADE\nIRON ORE DUMPS AND PLAN FOR ACTIVE\nOVER BURDEN/WASTE DUMP\nSAMAJ PARIVARTANA SAMUDAYA \u0026 ORS. v. 839\nSTATE OF KARANATAKA [RANJAN GOGOI, J.]\n22. This will include the total area of the dump(s), present A\ngradient, planned gradient, provision for retaining wall(s),\nbenches, final gradient, volume of over burden/waste dump\nthat may be stored, afforestation, use of geo-matting/geo-\ntextile, garland drains and other soil and moisture\nconservation/protective measures;\n23. The design will vary from mine to mine and within the\nmine from dump to dump. The prescription will also vary\nbetween old dumps and active dumps. The slope of 27\ndegree provided in the environment clearance may not be\nfeasible for dumping on steep hill slopes.\n24. The ultimate objective of the dump design/protective\nmeasure would be to ensure that the slopes are stable, are\nnot vulnerable to erosion and to provide for adequate\nprotective measures to capture/control run off:\n(D) MINING PITS\n25. In respect of the mining leases where the shape and\ndesign of the mining pits differ substantially from those\nprovided in the approved mining plan and /or found to be\nin gross violation of the approved design, mining will be\npermissible based on rectification as required by the\nconcerned statutory authority (viz. DGMS). Similarly, gross\nviolations under other Acts/Rules, if any, will need to be\nrectified (as required by the relevant statutory authorities).\n(E) SOIL AND MOISTURE CONSERVATIONS,\nAFFORESTATION AND OTHER MEASURES\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\n26. The R\u0026R plan would inter alia provide for:\nG\n(i) broad design/specification for\n(a) garland drains\n(b) retaining walls\nH\n"}
