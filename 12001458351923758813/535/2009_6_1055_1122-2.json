So far as the last seen aspect is concerned it is\nnecessary to take note of two decisions of this court. In State\nof U.P. v. Satish [2005 (3) SCC 114] it was noted as follows:\nB\nC\n\"22. The last seen theory comes into play where the time-\ngap between the point of time when the accused and the\ndeceased were seen last alive and when the deceased\nis found dead is so small that possibility of any person\nother than the accused being the author of the crime\nbecomes impossible. It would be difficult in some cases\nto positively establish that the deceased was last seen with\nthe accused when there is a long gap and possibility of\nother persons coming in between exists. In the absence.\nof any other positive evidence to conclude that the\naccused and the deceased were last seen together, it D\nwould be hazardous to come to a conclusion of guilt in\nthose cases. In this case there is positive evidence that\nthe deceased and the accused were seen together by\nwitnesses PWs. 3 and 5, in addition to the evidence of\nPW-2.\"\n7. In Ramreddy Rajeshkhanna Reddy v. State of A.P.\n[2006 (10) SCC 172] it was noted as follows:\n\"27. The last-seen theory, furthermore, comes into play\nwhere the time gap between the point of time when the\naccused and the deceased were last seen alive and the\ndeceased is found dead is so small that possibility of any\nperson other than the accused being the author of the\ncrime becomes impossible. Even in such a case the courts\nshould look for some corroboration\".\n(See also Bodh Raj v. State of J\u0026K (2002(8) SCC\n45).)\"\nE\nF\nG\n8. A similar view was also taken in Jaswant Gir v. State\nof Punjab [2005(12) SCC 438], Kusuma Ankama Rao v State H\n1076 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2009] 6 S.C.R.\nA of A.P. (2008(9) SCALE 652) and in Manivel \u0026 Ors. v. State\nof Tamil Nadu ( 2008(5) Supreme 577).\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\n0\nH\n9. In Joseph and Poulo v. State of Kerala [2000(5) SCC\n197] it was, inter alia, held as follows:\n\"The formidable incriminating circumstances against the\nappellant, as far as we could see, are that the deceased\nwas taken away from the convent by the appellant under\na false pretext and she was last seen alive only in his\ncompany and that it is on the information furnished by the\nappellant in the course of investigation that jewels of the\ndeceased which were sold to PW 11 by the appellant,\nwere seized.\"\n\"The incriminating circumstances enumerated above\nunmistakably and inevitably lead to the guilt of the\nappellant and nothing has been highlighted or brought on\nrecord to make the facts proved or the circumstances\nestablished to be in any manner in consonance with the\ninnocence at any rate of the appellant. During the time of\nquestioning under Section 313 Cr.P.C. the appellant\ninstead of making at least an attempt to explain or clarity\nthe incriminating circumstances inculpating him, and\nconnecting him with the crime by his adamant attitude of\ntotal denial of everything when those circumstances were\nbrought to his notice by the Court not only lost the\nopportunity but stood self-condemned. Such incriminating\nlinks of facts could, if at all, have been only explained by\nthe appellant, and by nobody else, they being personally\nand exclusively within his knowledge. Of late, courts have,\nfrom the falsity of the defence plea and false answers given\nto court, when questioned, found the missing links to be\nsupplied by such answers for completing the chain of\nincriminating circumstances necessary to connect the\nperson concerned with the crime committed. (See: State\nof Maharashtra v. Suresh). That missing link to connect the\nRAMESHBHAI CHANDUBHAI RATHOD v. STATE OF 1077\nGUJARAT [DR. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J.]\nB\naccused appellant, we find in this case provided by the A\nblunt and outright denial of every one and all that\nincriminating circumstances pointed out which, in our view,\nwith sufficient and reasonable certainty on the facts proved,\nconnect the accused with the death and the cause of the\ndeath of Gracy and for robbing her of her jewellery worn\nby her -MOs 1 to 3, under Section 392. The deceased\nmeekly went with the accused from the Convent on account\nof the misrepresentation made that her mother was\nseriously ill and hospitalised apparently reposing faith and\nconfidence in him in view of his close relationship - being C\nthe husband of her own sister, but the appellant seems to\nhave not only betrayed the confidence reposed in him but\nalso took advantage of the loneliness of the hapless\nwoman. The quantum of punishment imposed is\ncommensurate with the gravity of the charges held proved\nand calls for no interference in our hands, despite the fact\nthat we are not agreeing with the High Court in respect of\nthe findings relating to the charge under Section 376.\n10. In Damodar v. State of Karnataka [2000 SCC (Crl) 90]\nit was, inter alia, observed as follows:\nD\nE\n11. \"From the evidence of PWs. 1,6,7 \u0026 8 the prosecution\nhas satisfactorily established that the appellant was last seen\nwith the deceased on 30.4.91. The appellant either in his\nSection 313 Cr.P.C. statement or by any other evidence has F\nnot established when and where he and the deceased parted\ncompany after being last seen.\"\nG\n12. Before analyzing factual aspects it may be stated that\nfor a crime to be proved it is not necessary that the crime must\nbe seen to have been committed and must, in all circumstances\nbe proved by direct ocular evidence by examining before the\nCourt those persons who had seen its commission. The offence\ncan be proved by circumstantial evidence also. The principal\nfact or factum probandum may be proved indirectly by means\nof certain inferences drawn from factum probans, that is, the H\n1078 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2009] 6 S.C.R.\nA evidentiary facts. To put it differently circumstantial evidence is\nnot direct to the point in issue but consists of evidence of\nvarious other facts which are so closely associated with the fact\nin issue that taken together they form a chain of circumstances\nfrom which the existence of the principal fact can be legally\nB inferred or presumed.\nC\nD\n13. It has been consistently laid down by this Court that\nwhere a case rests squarely on circumstantial evidence, the\ninference of guilt can be justified only when all the incriminating\nfacts and circumstances are found to be incompatible with the\ninnocence of the accused or the guilt of any other person. (See\nHukam Singh v. State of Rajasthan AIR (1977 SC 1063);\nEradu and Ors. v. State of Hyderabad (AIR 1956 SC 316);\nEarabhadrappa v. State of Karnataka (AIR 1983 SC 446);\nState of U.P. v. Sukhbasi and Ors. (AIR 1985 SC 1224);\nBalwinder Singh v. State of Punjab (AIR 1987 SC 350); Ashok\nKumar Chatterjee v. State of M.P. (AIR 1989 SC 1890). The\ncircumstances from which an inference as to the guilt of the\naccused is drawn have to be proved beyond reasonable doubt\nand have to be shown to be closely connected with the principal\nE fact sought to be inferred from those circumstances. In Bhagat\nRam v. State of Punjab (AIR 1954 SC 621), it was laid down\nthat where the case depends upon the conclusion drawn from\ncircumstances the cumulative effect of the circumstances must\nbe such as to negative the innocence of the accused and bring\nF the offences home beyond any reasonable doubt.\nG\nH\n14. We may also make a reference to a decision of this\nCourt in C. Chenga Reddy and Ors. v. State of A.P. (1996)\n10 SCC 193, wherein it has been observed thus:\n\"In a case based on circumstantial evidence, the settled\nlaw is that the circumstances from which the conclusion of\nguilt is drawn should be fully proved and such\ncircumstances must be conclusive in nature. Moreover, all\nthe circumstances should be complete and there should\nbe no gap left in the chain of evidence. Further the proved\n:\nRAMESHBHAI CHANDUBHAI RATHOD v. STATE OF 1079\nGUJARAT [DR. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J.]\ncircumstances must be consistent only with the hypothesis A .\nof the guilt of the accused and totally inconsistent with his\ninnocence....\".\n15. In Padala Veera Reddy v. State of A.P. and Ors. (AIR\n1990 SC 79), it was laid down that when a case rests upon\ncircumstantial evidence, such evidence must satisfy the\nfollowing tests:\n\"(1) the circumstances from which an inference of guilt is\nsought to be drawn, must be cogently and firmly\nestablished;\n(2) those circumstances should be of a definite tendency\nunerringly pointing towards guilt of the accused;\n(3) the circumstances, taken cumulatively should form a\nchain so complete that there is no escape from the\nconclusion that within all human probability the crime was\ncommitted by the accused and none else; and\nB\nC\nD\n(4) the circumstantial evidence in order to sustain\nconviction must be complete and incapable of explanation E\nof any other hypothesis than that of the guilt of the accused\nand such evidence should not only be consistent with the\nguilt of the accused but should be inconsistent with his\ninnocence.\"\n16. In State of U.P. v. Ashok Kumar Srivastava, (1992\nCrl.LJ 1104), it was pointed out that great care must be taken\nin evaluating circumstantial evidence and if the evidence relied\non is reasonably capable of two inferences, the one in favour\nof the accused must be accepted. It was also pointed out that\nthe circumstances relied upon must be found to have been fully\nestablished and the cumulative effect of all the facts so\nestablished must be consistent only with the hypothesis of guilt.\nF\nG\n17. Sir Alfred Wills in his admirable book \"Wills'\nCircumstantial Evidence\" (Chapter VI) lays down the following H\n:\n1080 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2009] 6 S.C.R.\nA rules specially to be observed in the case of circumstantial\nevidence: (1) the facts alleged as the basis of any legal\ninference must be clearly proved and beyond reasonable doubt\nconnected with the factum probandum; (2) the burden of proof\nis always on the party who asserts the existence of any fact,\nB which infers legal accountability; (3) in all cases, whether of\ndirect or circumstantial evidence the best evidence must be\nadduced which the nature of the case admits; (4) in order to\njustify the inference of guilt, the inculpatory facts must be\nincompatible with the innocence of the accused and incapable\nof explanation, upon any other reasonable hypothesis than that\nof his guilt, (5) if there be any reasonable doubt of the guilt of\nthe accused, he is entitled as of right to be acquitted\".\nC\nD\n18. There is no doubt that conviction can be based solely\non circumstantial evidence but it should be tested by the touch-\nstone of law relating to circumstantial evidence laid down by\nthis Court as far back as in 1952.\n19. In Hanumant Govind Nargundkar and Anr. V. State\nof Madhya Pradesh, (AIR 1952 SC 343), wherein it was\nE observed thus:\nF\nG\n\"It is well to remember that in cases where the evidence\nis of a circumstantial nature, the circumstances from which\nthe conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should be in the first\ninstance be fully established and all the facts so\nestablished should be consistent only with the hypothesis\nof the guilt of the accused. Again, the circumstances should\nbe of a conclusive nature and tendency and they should\nbe such as to exclude every hypothesis but the one\nproposed to be proved. In other words, there must be a\nchain of evidence so far complete as not to leave any\nreasonable ground for a conclusion consistent with the\ninnocence of the accused and it must be such as to show\nthat within all human probability the act must have been\ndone by the accused.\"\n'\n'\nН\nRAMESHBHAI CHANDUBHAI RATHOD v. STATE OF 1081\nGUJARAT [DR. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J.]\n20. A reference may be made to a later decision in A\nSharad Birdhichand Sarda v. State of Maharashtra, (AIR 1984\nSC 1622). Therein, while dealing with circumstantial evidence,\nit has been held that onus was on the prosecution to prove that\nthe chain is complete and the infirmity of lacuna in prosecution\ncannot be cured by false defence or plea. The conditions\nprecedent in the words of this Court, before conviction could\nbe based on circumstantial evidence, must be fully established.\nThey are:\n(1) the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is\nto be drawn should be fully established. The circumstances\nconcerned must or should and not may be established;\nB\nC\n(2) the facts so established should be consistent only with\nthe hypothesis of the guilt of the accused, that is to say,\nthey should not be explainable on any other hypothesis D\nexcept that the accused is guilty;\n(3) the circumstances should be of a conclusive nature and\ntendency;\n(4) they should exclude every possible hypothesis except\nthe one to be proved; and\nE\n(5) there must be a chain of evidence so compete as not\nto leave any reasonable ground for the conclusion\nconsistent with the innocence of the accused and must F\nshow that in all human probability the act must have been\ndone by the accused.\n21. One of the other important circumstances is that the\naccused appellant had shown the place of incident where the\ndead body of the deceased was found lying. At the instance of\nthe appellant his cycle and school bag of the deceased were\nrecovered and the school bag was found containing anklets and\nearrings belonging to the deceased. Human blood was found\non the T-shirt of the accused. The falsity of defence plea has\nG\nH\n1082 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2009] 6 S.C.R.\nA been regarded as an additional link in the chain of\ncircumstances. The conviction has therefore been rightly\nrecorded by the trial Court and affirmed by the High Court.\n22. Coming to the question of award of death sentence,\nthis has to be considered in the background of factual scenario.\nB\n23. The law regulates social interests, arbitrates conflicting\nclaims and demands. Security of persons and property of the\npeople is an essential function of the State. It could be achieved\nthrough instrumentality of criminal law. Undoubtedly, there is a\nC cross cultural conflict where living law must find answer to the\nnew challenges and the courts are required to mould the\nsentencing system to meet the challenges. The contagion of\nlawlessness would undermine social order and lay it in ruins.\nProtection of society and stamping out criminal proclivity must\nD be the object of law which must be achieved by imposing\nappropriate sentence. Therefore, law as a corner-stone of the\nedifice of \"order\" should meet the challenges confronting the\nsociety. Friedman in his \"Law in Changing Society\" stated that,\n\"State of criminal law continues to be - as it should be - a\nE decisive reflection of social consciousness of society\".\nTherefore, in operating the sentencing system, law should adopt\nthe corrective machinery or the deterrence based on factual\nmatrix. By deft modulation sentencing process be stern where\nit should be, and tempered with mercy where it warrants to be.\nThe facts and given circumstances in each case, the nature of\nthe crime, the manner in which it was planned and committed,\nthe motive for commission of the crime, the conduct of the\naccused, the nature of weapons used and all other attending\ncircumstances are relevant facts which would enter into the area\nof consideration. For instance a murder committed due to\ndeep-seated mutual and personal rivalry may not call for penalty\nof death. But an organised crime or mass murders of innocent\npeople would call for imposition of death sentence as\ndeterrence. In Mahesh v. State of M.P. (1987) 2 SCR 710),\nthis Court while refusing to reduce the death sentence observed\nH\nF\nG\nRAMESHBHAI CHANDUBHAI RATHOD v. STATE OF 1083\nGUJARAT [DR. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J.]\nthus:\n\"It will be a mockery of justice to permit the accused to\nescape the extreme penalty of law when faced with such\nevidence and such cruel acts. To give the lesser\npunishment for the accused would be to render the justicing\nsystem of the country suspect. The common man will lose\nfaith in courts. In such cases, he understands and\nappreciates the language of deterrence more than the\nreformative jargon.\"\n24. Therefore, undue sympathy to impose inadequate\nsentence would do more harm to the justice system to\nundermine the public confidence in the efficacy of law and\nsociety could not long endure under such serious threats. It is,\ntherefore, the duty of every court to award proper sentence\nhaving regard to the nature of the offence and the manner in\nwhich it was executed or committed etc. This position was\nilluminatingly stated by this Court in Sevaka Perumal etc. v.\nState of Tamil Naidu (AIR 1991 SC 1463).\n25. The criminal law adheres in general to the principle of\nproportionality in prescribing liability according to the culpability\nof each kind of criminal conduct. It ordinarily allows some\nsignificant discretion to the Judge in arriving at a sentence in\neach case, presumably to permit sentences that reflect more\nsubtle considerations of culpability that are raised by the\nspecial facts of each case. Judges in essence affirm that\npunishment ought always to fit the crime; yet in practice\nsentences are determined largely by other considerations.\nSometimes it is the correctional needs of the perpetrator that\nare offered to justify a sentence. Sometimes the desirability of\nkeeping him out of circulation, and sometimes even the tragic\nresults of his crime. Inevitably these considerations cause a\ndeparture from just desert as the basis of punishment and\ncreate cases of apparent injustice that are serious and\nwidespread.\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nA\n1084 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2009] 6 S.C.R.\n26. Proportion between crime and punishment is a goal\nrespected in principle, and in spite of errant notions, it remains\na strong influence in the determination of sentences. The\npractice of punishing all serious crimes with equal severity is\nnow unknown in civilized societies, but such a radical departure\nB from the principle of proportionality has disappeared from the\nlaw only in recent times. Even now for a single grave infraction\ndrastic sentences are imposed. Anything less than a penalty\nof greatest severity for any serious crime is thought then to be\na measure of toleration that is unwarranted and unwise. But in\nfact, quite apart from those considerations that make\npunishment unjustifiable when it is out of proportion to the crime,\nuniformly disproportionate punishment has some very\nundesirable practical consequences.\nC\n27. After giving due consideration to the facts and\nD circumstances of each case, for deciding just and appropriate\nsentence to be awarded for an offence, the aggravating and\nmitigating factors and circumstances in which a crime has been\ncommitted are to be delicately balanced on the basis of really\nrelevant circumstances in a dispassionate manner by the Court.\nE Such act of balancing is indeed a difficult task. It has been very\naptly indicated in Dennis Councle MCG Dautha v. State of\nCalifornia: 402 US 183: 28 L.D. 2d 711 that no formula of a\nfoolproof nature is possible that would provide a reasonable\ncriterion in determining a just and appropriate punishment in\nF the infinite variety of circumstances that may affect the gravity\nof the crime. In the absence of any foolproof formula which may\nprovide any basis for reasonable criteria to correctly assess\nvarious circumstances germane to the consideration of gravity\nof crime, the discretionary judgment in the facts of each case,\nis the only way in which such judgment may be equitably\ndistinguished.\nG\nH.\n28. In Jashubha Bharatsinh Gohil v. State of Gujarat\n(1994 (4) SCC 353), it has been held by this Court that in the\nmatter of death sentence, the Courts are required to answer\n"}
