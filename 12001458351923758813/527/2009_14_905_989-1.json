A further controversy can then be raised\nby the landlords that what was paid was not 80% and\nwas short of 80% and, therefore, the acquisition should\nbe set at naught. Such extreme interpretation cannot be B\nafforded because indeed u/s. 17 itself, the basic idea of\navoiding the enquiry u/s. 5-A is in view of the urgent need\non the part of the State Government for the land to be\nacquired for any eventuality discovered by either Sub-\nSection (1) or Sub-Section (2) of Section 17 of the Act.

Reading paragraph 14\nof Meerut Development Authority case, in its correct\nperspective would repel the argument that the provision\nis arbitrary in any manner or has the effect of creating\nimpermissible classification. If the petitioners in Meerut H\n916 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2009] 14 (ADDL.)

There can be no question of Section 17(4)\nproviso or the provisions of the Amending Act being\ninvalid in any way. The provisions in any manner are not\narbitrary or making impermissible classifications or\nsuggesting invidious discrimination nor can the\nprovisions in the Amending Act can be termed as\n\"arbitrary\" providing no guiding principles.

The Validation Act did not confer any discretion\non the State Government to apply its provisions to a\nparticular scheme and then issue notifications. It was a\none time exercise for validating a particular scheme by\namending the Act which has already been found to be\nvalid in Meerut Development Authority case. Again\nUjariyaon Housing Scheme Part-III did not lapse because\nof the decision of the Government. Since the award was\nnot made within the time prescribed by Section 11A of the\nAct, it had the effect of lapsing the notifications.\nTherefore, the State Government was left with no other\nway and had to issue a fresh notification. In Ujariyaon\nHousing Scheme Part-II, the award was made by the\nCollector within the time and, therefore, those\nnotifications were not affected.

The\nHigh Court has correctly held that Sub-Sections (1), (3A)\nand (4) of Section 17 of the Act do not suffer from any\nunconstitutionality on account of the alleged breach of\nArticle 14 of the Constitution of India.

The High Court has correctly come to the\nconclusion that there was all the justification for invoking\nthe urgency clause and taking the possession for the\nlands in question. It can not be ignored that this land was\nurgently needed for housing. Large-scale development\nand utilization of acquired land after the acquisition is\napparent on the face of the record. A number of houses\nhave been constructed, third party interests were created\nin whose favour the plots were allotted and the High G\nCourt has also commented while disposing of the writ\npetitions that the quashing of the notification at this stage\nwill prejudice the interests of the people for whom the\nschemes were evolved. While considering as to whether\nH\nB\n920\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS [2009] 14 (ADDL.) S.C.R.\nA the Government was justified in doing away with the\ninquiry under Section 5A, it must be noted that there are\nno allegations of mala fides against the authority. In the\npresent case, the High Court has gone into the records\nand has recorded categorical finding that there was\nsufficient material before the State Government and the\nState Government has objectively considered the issue\nof urgency. Even before this Court, there were no\nallegations of mala fides. Therefore, it is not correct to say\nthat there was no urgency to justify dispensation of\nSection 5A inquiry by applying the urgency clause.\nAcquisitions in this case are of 1984-1985 and two\ndecades have passed thereafter.

This Court will not go into the questions of facts\nlike the non-publication of Sections 4 and 6 notifications.\nSimilar is the question raised about the land belonging\nto the co-operative society and the release of the same.\nThe High Court judgment is absolutely correct in that\nbehalf. Even if the Government had taken a decision not\nG to acquire the land belonging to the co-operative society\nas far as possible, there is nothing wrong if such lands\nwere acquired. What is to be seen is the bona fides of the\nGovernment behind the decision to acquire the lands. On\nthat account no fault can be found with the concerned\nnotifications u/ss. 4 and 6. [Para 65] [986-B-E]\nI\n!\nW\nTIKA RAM \u0026 ORS. v. STATE OF U.P. \u0026 ORS. 921\n6. As regards the question of possession, the Court A\ndoes not propose to go into the question of facts and\nquestions relating to the individual claims. When the\nwhole township is standing, this question goes to the\nbackdrop. In the face of Panchanama, which is on record,\nthe finding of the High Court that the possession was B\ntaken on 21.5.1985 is endorsed. [Paras 66 and 67] [986-\nF, 987-C-D]\nC\nD\n7. LDA also found fault with the Sale Deed in favour\nof Pratap Sahkari Grih Nirman Samiti Ltd.. It was urged\nthat its claim was based on the Sale Agreement, which\nwas executed one day before the publication of Section\n4 Notification in the Gazette, i.e., 8.12.1984. It is admitted\ncase that the Sale Deed was registered on 22.1.1986,\nwhich is clearly a date beyond the date of Section 4\nnotification. If any purchases of the land are made after\nthe publication of Section 4(1) notification, landlords in\nthis case would not get any right or entitlement to\nquestion the validity of the title of the State based on the\nacquisition. Obviously, the claim of this Society is on the\nbasis of the Agreement of Sale dated 7.4.1983. The High E\nCourt was correct in holding that the Society had\npurchased the land after the issuance of notification. The\npolicy to give back 25% of the acquired land to the co-\noperative societies, even if there is one, would not be\napplicable to the Society in question. Therefore, it is not F\nacceptable that Pratap Sahkari Grih Nirman Samiti Ltd.\nShould be given back 25% of the land acquired, which\nis again not possible in view of the township having\ncome up.
