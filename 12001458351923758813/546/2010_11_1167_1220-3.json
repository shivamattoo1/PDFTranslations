Section 245C(1) read with the proviso thereto, as\nsubstituted by Finance Act, 2007 w.e.f. 1.6.2007, reads as\nunder:\n245C. (1) An assessee may, at any stage of a case\nrelating to him, make an application in such form and in\nsuch manner as may be prescribed, and containing a full\nand true disclosure of his income which has not been\ndisclosed before the Assessing Officer, the manner in\nBRIJ LAL \u0026 ORS. v. COMMISSIONER OF INCOME 1203\nTAX, JALANDHAR [S.H. KAPADIA, CJI.]\nwhich such income has been derived, the additional A\namount of income-tax payable on such income and such\nother particulars as may be prescribed, to the Settlement\nCommission to have the case settled and any such\napplication shall be disposed of in the manner hereinafter\nprovided:\nProvided that no such application shall be made unless,-\n(i) the additional amount of income tax payable on\nthe income disclosed in the application exceeds three lakh\nrupees; and\n(ii)\nsuch tax and the interest thereon, which\nwould have been paid under the provisions\nof this Act had the income disclosed in the\nB\nC\napplication been declared in the return of D\nincome before the Assessing Officer on the\ndate of application, has been paid on or\nbefore the date of making the application and\nthe proof of such payment is attached with\nthe application.\nAnalysis of the Act\nE\n7. Liability to pay advance tax arises under section 207.\nThe said section is based on the principle \"pay as you earn\".\nIt requires tax to be paid during the financial year. It has to be F\nin respect of the total income of the assessee which would be\nchargeable to tax under the Act. The said total income is not\nas understood in section 2(45) but it is equated to \"current\nincome\" for the purposes of Chapter XVII. After the Amending\nAct of 1987, advance tax is to be paid on the current income\nwhich would be chargeable to tax for the assessment year\nimmediately following the financial year. Section 210 casts the\nresponsibility of payment of advance tax on the assessee\nwithout requiring the assessee to submit his estimate of\nadvance tax payable. Provision for payment of advance tax is\nG\nH\n1204\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS [2010] 11 S.C.R.\nC\nD\nA mode of quick collection of tax. Thus, section 207 defines\nliability to pay advance tax in respect of incomes referred to\nin section 208. However, advance tax paid is adjustable\ntowards the tax due. Advance tax is collected even before the\nincome tax becomes due and payable. By its very nature,\nB advance tax is pre-assessment collection of taxes either by\ndeduction of tax at source or by payment of advance tax which\nhas to be adjusted towards income tax levied on the total\nincome. The above two methods of realization even before\nany assessment is authorized by section 4(2) are incorporated\nin Chapter XVII which deals with \"collection and recovery\". In\nfact, section 190(1) clarifies that this method of payment of tax\nwill not prejudice the charge of tax under section 4(1) nor will\nit modify the liability of the assessee to pay income tax pursuant\nto an assessment order. [See Modi Industries Limited,\nModinagar and Others v. Commissioner of Income Tax, Delhi\nand Another, 216 ITR 759 at 780] At one point of time, section\n209(1)(a)(iii) (relating to computation of advance tax) provided\nthat the income tax calculated on the total income with reference\nto which the demand for advance tax was made should be\nreduced by the amount of income tax deductible in accordance\nwith sections 192 to 194, 194A and 195 on any income\nincluded in the total income. The levy of interest under section\n215 is part of the process of assessment. If the income tax\nliability on the first day of the assessment year is larger than\nthe amount of advance tax standing to the credit of the\nassessee then interest will have to be paid under section 215\non 75% of the deficit amount of tax from the first day of the\nassessment year to the date of computation of total income\nvide assessment order. Interest under section 215 is\nchargeable from the first day of April next following the financial\nyear wherein the advance tax was paid up to the date of regular\nassessment, if no tax has been paid under section 140A or\notherwise. However, section 215(2) provides that where\nadvance tax paid is less than 75% of the \"assessed tax\", but\nthe assessee has paid tax under section 140A or otherwise\nH before the date of completion of regular assessment then the\nE\nF\nG\nBRIJ LAL \u0026 ORS. v. COMMISSIONER OF INCOME 1205\nTAX, JALANDHAR [S.H. KAPADIA, CJI.]\ninterest shall be limited to the interest on the shortfall between A\nthe \"assessed tax\" and the advance tax paid for the period\nfrom the first April next following the financial year up to date\nof payment under section 140A plus interest on the shortfall\nbetween \"assessed tax\" and \"total tax paid\" for the period\nfrom the day following the date of such payment under section B\n140A up to the date of regular assessment. Coming to section\n140A, as a result of the amendment of section 140A(1) by\nDirect Tax Laws Amendment Act, 1987 w.e.f. 1.4.1989 and\nvide Finance Act of 1999, the assessee is required to calculate\nthe tax payable on the basis of the return to be furnished under C\nsection 139 or under section 142 or under section 148 after\ntaking into account the amount of tax paid under the Act; to\ncalculate also interest payable under section 234A or under\nsection 234B/234C for any default or delay in payment of\nadvance tax; to pay such tax with interest before the assessee\nfurnishes his return. The Explanation to section 140A(1) inter\nalia provides that where the amount paid by the assessee\nunder section 140A(1) falls short of the aggregate of the tax\nand interest thereon the amount so paid is first adjusted\ntowards interest payable and the balance, if any, is adjusted\ntowards the tax payable. Thus, amount(s) paid under section\n140A is deemed to have been paid towards regular\nassessment.\nD\nE\n8. The liability to pay income tax is founded on sections\n4 and 5 which are the charging sections. Sections 143, 144 F\nand 147 are machinery sections to determine the amount of\ntax payable. Thus, whereas section 143(3) signifies\ncomputation of income, section 147 signifies computation of\nescaped income. As held in the case of C.A. Abraham v.\nIncome-Tax Officer, Kottayam and Another [(1961) 41 ITR G\n425 (SC)], the expression \"assessment\" in a given provision\nmust be determined on an examination of the relevant\nprovisions in question and the fact that it is used in the narrower\nsense elsewhere will not mean that it is so used in the provision\nunder examination. The word can be used to cover the whole\nH\n1206 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2010] 11 S.C.R.\nA procedure to ascertain the liability and the machinery for\nenforcement. Prior to 1.6.1999, section 143(1A)(a) inter alia\nprovided that where the total income as a result of any\nadjustments made exceeded the total income declared in the\nreturn by any amount then it was open to the A.O. to increase\nB the amount of tax payable under section 143(1) by additional\nincome tax calculated at the specified rate. In brief, section\n143(1A) provided for the levy of additional income tax of an\namount equal to 20% of the tax payable on the amount of\ndifference between the total income determined under section\nC 143(1) and total income declared in the return. Where the\nadditional income tax was increased, the A.O. had to serve a\nnotice under section 156. Even under section 143(1B), as it\nstood before 1.6.1999, where an assessee furnished a revised\nreturn under section 139(5) after service of intimation, the\nassessee was liable to pay additional income tax in relation\nto adjustments made under section 143(1)(a) read with the\nproviso.\nD\n9. Now, Chapter XVII deals with \"collection and recovery\".\nIt covers Tax Deduction at Source and Advance Payment of\nE taxes (see section 190). Section C deals with advance payment\nof taxes. Section 207 refers to liability to pay advance tax\nwhereas section 209 deals with computation of advance tax.\nSection 215 refers to interest payable by the assessee. Section\n210(1) inter alia provides that every person who is liable to\nF pay interest under Section 208, shall of his own accord pay,\non each of the due dates specified in section 211, the\nappropriate percentage of advance tax on his current income\ncalculated in the manner under section 209. Under section\n209(1)(a), the amount of advance tax payable by the assessee\nG in any financial year is as follows:\nH\n(a) where calculation is made by the assessee for the\npurposes of payment of advance tax under section 209(1), he\nshall first estimate his current income and the tax shall be\ncomputed at the rates in force in the financial year. Thus, liability\n"}
