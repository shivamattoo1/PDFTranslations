The appellants in this appeal were included in a ranked list for\nappointment to the post of Overseer Grade-II in the Public Works and Irrigation\nDepartments. The ranked list was published on 31.3.2001. Its normal validity\nwas one year. But if no new list was prepared, its validity extended to three\nyears. No new list was prepared. Therefore, the list was operative till 31.3.2004.\nG\nH\n1044\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 5 S.C.R.\nA 4. In the list prepared, diploma holders were not included on the ground\nthat they possessed a qualification higher than the one required. The diploma\nholders filed writ petitions in the High Court seeking the issue of a writ of\nmandamus directing the Kerala Public Service Commission to include them in\nthe ranked list. On 18.2.2003, the High Court allowed the writ petitions and\ndirected that the ranked list be recast including the diploma holders also. This\ncaused some delay in the operation of the list prepared on 31.3.2001.\nB\nC\n5. Even prior thereto, the Government of Kerala had issued an order\nbanning new appointments in view of the circumstances prevailing in the\nservices in the State. This ban on new appointments was in force from May\n2002 to November 2003, for a period of 18 months. The result was that on the\nreporting of vacancies, only 633 names were advised for appointment.\n6. Under Rule 13 of the Kerala Public Service Commission Rules of\nProcedure, the Public Service Commission, under the 5th Proviso thereto, had\nthe power to keep alive the ranked list, which was normally due to expire\nD during the period when there was a ban on appointments, for a period of 30\ndays from the date of cessation of the ban. On 4.9.2002, the 5th Proviso to\nRule 13 of the Rules was amended. The substituted 5th proviso to Rule 13\nof the Rules read as follows:\n(I)\nE\nF\nG\n\"Provided further that if the commission is satisfied of the existence\nof period of general ban declared by the Government on the reporting\nof vacancies to the Public Service Commission or of any other\ncircumstances or of any extraordinary situation in which the reporting\nof vacancies by the appointing authorities is prevented or restricted\nor delayed, the Commission shall have the power to keep alive the\nRanked Lists which are normally due to expire during the said period\nto such periods as may be decided by the Commission subject to a\nminimum period of three months or for such further periods but not\nexceeding one year in the aggregate. If the Commission so decides it\nshall issue a notification keeping alive the Ranked Lists in the above\nmanner and shall advise candidates from such Ranked Lists to the\nvacancies reported during such extended period of validity of the\nRanked Lists.\"\n7. On 19.11.2003, the Government of Kerala recommended to the Public\nService Commission to extend the validity of lists upto the end of Year 2004\nin view of the ban that was in operation. The Public Service Commission did\nH not exercise its power under the 5th proviso to Rule 13 of the Rules to extend\nK. THULASEEDHARAN v. KERALA STATE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION, TRIVANDRUM (BALASUBRAMANYAN, J.J 1045\nthe validity of the list. The Government therefore again wrote on 21.2.2004 A\nasking the Public Service Commission to keep alive the ranked lists until the\nend of December 2004. Pursuant to this request, the Kerala Public Service\nCommission met on 2.4.2004 and extended the lists that were current and that\nwere to expire thereafter till 30.12.2004. The ranked list in respect of the 2nd\nGrade Overseer with which we are concerned, was not kept alive on the basis\nB\nthat the list had expired on 31.3.2004 and on 2.4.2004, the Public Service\nCommission could not exercise its power to keep alive a list which had already\nexpired. Thus, though the extension benefited some of the other ranked lists,\nthe ranked list in question was treated as having expired by 31.3.2004.\nC\n8. In that context, the appellant approached the High Court with a writ\npetition. The learned single judge following an earlier decision of a Division\nBench in W.A. No. 1053 of 2004, took the view that the decision of the Public\nService Commission to extend the validity of the ranked lists which were alive\nas on 3.4.2004 could not be relied on to claim that the concerned ranked list\nwhich had expired by 31.3.2004 had revived or had been kept alive. The\nargument that if the Public Service Commission had taken prompt action, the D\nvalidity of the concerned ranked list would have also stood extended, was\nrejected in the light of the legal position. The appellant thereupon filed an\nappeal before the Division Bench of the High Court. The Division Bench after\nreferring to its prior decision in W.A. No. 1053 of 2004 and taking note of the\nfact that the concerned list had expired before the Notification dated 3.4.2004\nextending the validity of the various lists was issued, held that the expired\nlist could not be kept alive or revived in exercise of power under the 5th\nproviso to Rule 13 of the Rules. Affirming the decision of the learned single\njudge, the appeal was dismissed. The decision of the Division Bench is in\nchallenge before us at the instance of the appellant and certain others similarly\nsituated.\nE\nF\nG\n9. Shri C.S. Rajan, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellants\npointed out that the stand adopted by the Public Service Commission in the\ncase on hand that the Commission had no power to extend the validity of a\nranked list that had expired was not correct and was inconsistent with its own\nstand in other cases. Learned counsel pointed to two other instances where\nthe Commission had extended the validity of lists, the period of which had\nalready expired on the day the notification in exercise of power under the 5th\nproviso to Rule 13 of the Rules was issued and contended that it was not\nopen to the Public Service Commission to adopt an inconsistent stand just\nto defeat the claim of the appellant. Learned counsel for the Public Service H\n1046\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 5 S.C.R.\nA Commission could not really explain how the Public Service Commission\ncould have revalidated lists which had already expired in the instances pointed\nout by learned counsel for the appellants. Though, we have some sympathy\nfor the appellants considering the circumstances, we find it not possible to\ngrant any relief to the appellants since on an interpretation of the Rule\nconcerned, we are not in a position to disagree with the view adopted by the\nHigh Court in the judgment in W.A. No. 1053 of 2004 and in the judgment\nunder Appeal.\nB\nC\n10. The 5th proviso to Rule 13 of the Rules relied upon clearly gives\nan indication that the power available thereunder could be exercised only in\nthe case of a ranked list which is still subsisting or the life of which is still\ncontinuing. The words \"the Commission shall have the power to keep alive\nthe Ranked Lists which are normally due to expire during the said period\"\n(emphasis supplied) clearly show that it is a question of keeping alive until\na future date, of a live list, the term of which is to expire shortly. The power\nunder the 5th proviso to Rule 13 of the Rules cannot be made use of to\nD revalidate a time expired ranked list. The two instances pointed out by learned\nE\nF\nSenior Counsel for the appellants where the Public Service Commission had\ndone it, could not be justified legally in the light of the 5th proviso to Rule\n13 of the Rules. They must be treated as aberrations. They cannot form the\nfoundation of any right. In this situation, we are satisfied that there is no\njustification in interfering with the decision of the High Court since by\n3.4.2004 when the notification extending the validity of the lists was issued,\nthe validity of the list in question had expired and the same could not be\nrevived in alleged exercise of power under the 5th proviso to Rule 13 of the\nRules.\n11. Before parting with the case, we think that it is necessary to express\nour unhappiness at the inconsistent conduct of the Public Service Commission.\nThe Public Service Commission is a constitutional body and it is expected to\nact even handedly and strictly in accordance with law. When the 5th proviso\nto Rule 13 of the Rules gives it only a power to extend the validity of lists\nfor the periods referred to therein in the circumstances indicated therein, it has\nG\nonly the power to keep alive a ranked list which is still current on the day\nthe decision is taken and not revive and keep alive a ranked list which had\nalready expired. The counter affidavit of the Public Service Commission itself\nindicates that the High Court has taken such a view in about 50 cases. It is\nnot expected of a constitutional body like the Public Service Commission to\nH issue orders or notifications for which it has no authority. On a true\nK. THULASEEDHARAN v. KERALA STATE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION, TRIVANDRUM [BALASUBRAMANYAN, 1.11047\nconstruction of the concerned provision this is the position. It is interesting A\nto note that the stand adopted by the Public Service Commission in the\npresent case before the High Court and before us is also that under the 5th\nproviso to Rule 13 of the Rules it has no power to revive a dead list and all\nthat it can do is to keep alive for a further period a list which is still alive on\nthe day the decision is taken. We trust that the Public Service Commission\nwould ensure that such illegalities like the issuing of orders relied upon by\nthe learned counsel for the appellant, are not committed creating hardship and\nagony to some, out of many included in lists prepared by the Public Service\nCommission.\nB\n12. Since we are in agreement with the decision of the High Court, we C\nsee no reason to interfere. We dismiss the appeal.\nP.K. BALASUBRAMANYAN, J. 1. Leave granted.\n2. Heard counsel on both sides.\nD\n3. The appellant was included in a ranked list of Lower Division Clerks\nfor appointment in the Kerala State Electricity Board. The list was published\non 24.1.2001 and on expiry of three Years, it was to expire on 24.01.2004. On\n19.11.2003, the Kerala Public Service Commission extended the validity of the\nlist till 4.2.2004. The list thereafter expired. The appellant who held rank\nnumber 133 was not advised for appointment and only those ranked upto 60, E\nwere advised for appointment from the list while it was alive. It was in that\nsituation that the appellant approached the High Court praying for the issue\nof a writ of mandamus directing the Public Service Commission and the Kerala\nState Electricity Board to advise her for appointment and to give her\nappointment after extending the validity of the list.\n4. The Writ Petition and the appeal from it were dismissed following the\ndecision that has given rise to the appeal which we have disposed of by a\njudgment delivered separately today, arising out of Petitions for Special Leave\nto Appeal (Civil) No. 21495 of 2004 and No. 261 of 2005.\nF\nG\n5. In the View we have taken in that judgment, the list having expired\nby 4.2.2004, and its validity not having been extended thereafter, no relief\ncould be granted to the appellant on the ground put forward in the High\nCourt. But, learned counsel for the appellant raised a new contention before\nus, which is not seen raised before the High Court. He contended that on\n19.11.2003, the Public Service Commission took a decision to extend the H\nB\n1048\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 5 S.C.R.\nA validity of the list upto 4.2.2004, the list that was to expire by 24.1.2004. That\nmeant, that the power to keep alive the list was exercised in time, but the same\nwas not properly exercised in that it was not extended in terms of the 5th\nprovision to Rule 13 of the Rules. Learned counsel pointed out that under the\n5th proviso to Rule 13 of the Rules, the Commission had the power to keep\nalive the ranked list which was about to expire for such periods as has been\ndecided by the Commission, subject to a minimum period of three months or\nfor such further periods but not exceeding one year in the aggregate Learned\ncounsel pointed out that on 19.11.2003, what the Commission did was to\nextend the life of the list only by 11 days and this was not consistent with\ntheir power of keeping alive the list for a further period of not less than three\nC months but not exceeding one year. Therefore, it must be taken that on\n19.11.2003, the decision was to keep alive the list at least for a period of three\nmonths.\n6. Learned counsel for the Public Service Commission could not give an\nexplanation for the reason to extend the validity of the list only by a period\nD of 11 days and not by a minimum period of three months. But learned counsel\nsubmitted that such a contention had not been raised and therefore he was\nnot in a position to explain the circumstances. Though we see some force in\nthe contention sought to be raised by learned counsel for the appellant since\nwe find that the validity of the list had not been extended from 4.2.2004 and\nthree years have gone by, it would not be proper on the basis of the new plea\nsought to be raised before us, to interfere to grant any relief to the appellant\nin the writ petition even if it is otherwise possible. In this situation, we decline\nto interfere with the decision of the High Court and dismiss the appeal.\nE\nS.K.S.\nAppeals dismissed.\n"}
