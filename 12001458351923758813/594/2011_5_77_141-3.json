STATE 107\nOF MADHYA PRADESH AND ORS. [G.S. SINGHVI, J.]\nStudies (2009) 6 SCC 171 and argued that the Court cannot A\nexercise the power of judicial review to nullify the policy framed\nby the State Government to allot Nazul land without\nadvertisement. Shri Ravi Shanker Prasad referred to paragraph\n26 of the RBC and argued that the State Government is\npossessed with the power to make allotment without charging B\npremium or waive the same. Learned senior counsel then relied\nupon a passage from Chapter IV of the Law of Trusts and\nCharities by Atul M Setalvad, judgments of this Court in State\nof Uttar Pradesh v. Bansi Dhar (1974) 1 SCC 447 and\nCanbank Financial Services Ltd. v. Custodian (2004) 8 SCC\n355 and argued that intention to create a trust was sufficient\nfor making an application for reservation and allotment of land\nin favour of respondent No.5. He submitted that while making\nrequest for reservation of land in favour of the Memorial Trust,\nShir Kailash Joshi had made it clear that the same will be used\nfor establishing a training institute in the name of late Shri\nKhushabhau Thakre and this was a clear indication to the State\nGovernment that a trust will be created for managing the\ninstitute.\nC\nD\nF\n8. Shri Ranjit Kumar, learned senior counsel appearing for E\nrespondent No.5, submitted that this Court should not interfere\nwith the impugned allotment because at every stage of the\nproceedings i.e. reservation of land, formation of trust and\nchange of land use, objections were invited from public but at\nno stage the appellant had filed any objection. The learned\ncounsel extensively referred to the RBC, the provisions of the\nAct and Madhya Pradesh Nagar Tatha Gram Nivesh Viksit\nBhoomiyo, Griho, Bhavano Tatha Anya Sanrachanao Ka\nVyayan Niyam, 1975 (for short 'the Rules') and argued that the\nallotment of land to respondent No.5 and change of land use\nare not vitiated due to violation of any constitutional or legal\nprinciple warranting interference by the Court. Shri Ranjit Kumar\nrelied upon Sections 3,5 and 6 of the Indian Trusts Act, 1882\nand Sections 2,4,5,6,8,11,32 and 33 of the 1951 Act and\nargued that intention to create trust was sufficient to enable Shri\nG\nH\nB\n108 SUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2011] 5 S.C.R.\nA Kailash Joshi to make applications for reservation and allotment\nof land in the name of the institute and, in any case, the\nappellant cannot take advantage of non-registration of the trust\nup to 6.10.2004 because on the date of actual allotment i.e.\n27.01.2006 the trust stood registered. Learned senior counsel\nalso emphasized that once the trust was registered, the factum\nof registration will relate back to the date of application i.e.\n31.07.2004, which was prior to the reservation of land by the\nState Government. In the end, Shri Ranjit Kumar submitted that\nthe Court may not nullify the impugned allotment at the instance\nof the appellant because it did not question hundreds of similar\nallotments made in favour of other organizations/institutions.\nLearned senior counsel also relied upon the judgment of this\nCourt in Harsh Dhingra v. State of Haryana (2001) 9 SCC 550\nand argued that the impugned allotment may not be quashed\nand the law which may be laid down by this Court should govern\nthe allotments, which may be made in future.\nC\nD\n9. We have considered the respective submissions. For\ndeciding the questions arising in the appeal, it will be useful to\nnotice the relevant provisions of the Act, the Rules and the\nE RBC.\nF\nG\nH\n10.

If the\nState Government sends a requisition for that purpose then also\nthe local authority is required to prepare a zoning plan. Section\n21 specifies the matters which are to be incorporated in the\nzoning plan. By virtue of Section 22, the provisions of Sections\n18 and 19 have been made applicable for the purpose of\npreparation, publication, approval and operation of zoning plan.\nSection 23(1) empowers the Director to undertake a review and\nevaluation of the development plan either on his own motion\nG or in terms of the directions given by the State Government.\nLikewise, under Section 23(4) the local authority can undertake\nreview and evaluation of the zoning plan on its own motion or\nas per the direction of the State Government or the Director.\nSection 23-A was inserted in the Act by M.P.
