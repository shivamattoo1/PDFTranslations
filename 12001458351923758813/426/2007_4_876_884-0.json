This is more so in view of the fact that even a\nlarge number of persons who have filed different suits in different courts of\nlaw were not parties before the High Court in the writ petition and, thus, any\nobservation and findings of the High Court would otherwise also not be binding\non them.

Dispute between the parties centres round the\nmanagement of a large number of Churches known as \"Syrian Churches\".

A writ petition was filed by the appellants herein\nbefore the Kerala High Court, praying inter alia, for the following reliefs:\nH\n\"a. In the above facts and circumstances of the case this Hon'ble\nCourt may kindly be pleased to issue a writ of mandamus or any other\nMOHAN M. BASELIOS MARTHOMA MATHEWS LI v. STATE OF KERALA [S. B. SINHA, J.] 879\n1\nappropriate writ order or directions commanding respondents 1 to 4 A\nand their subordinates to give effective and adequate police protection\nto the First Petitioner to exercise his rights, duties and privileges as\nThe Catholicos cum Malankara Metropolitan of the Malankara Church\nwith respect to the Parishes mentioned in Exhibit P4 and Institutions\nof the Malankara Church without any threat or obstruction from\nB\nRespondents 5 to 13 or their agents or servants in any manner.\nb.

To issue a writ of mandamus or any other appropriate writ order or\ndirections commanding respondents 1 to 4 to give effective and\nadequate police protection to other Bishops similarly placed as well\nas to the faithful members of the Malankara Church for the purpose\nof participating in the conduct of religious services in the said Parish\nChurches of the Malankara Church by petitioners without any threat\nor obstruction from Respondents 5-13 or their agents or servants in\nany manner.\nE\nd. Issue a writ of mandamus or any other appropriate writ order or\ndirection commanding respondents 1 to 4 to take steps to see that\nrespondents 5 to 13 do not enter into any of the churches of the\nMalankara Orthodox Syrian Church mentioned in Exhibit P4 and\nInstitutions of the Malankara Church in any capacity either as F\nCatholicose, Bishop, Priest or in any other manner.\ne. Issue appropriate directions to Respondents 1 to 4 to restrain\nrespondents 5 to 13 from in any way obstructing the petitioners from\nexercising the powers in accordance with the provisions of 1934\nConstitution of the Malankara Church with respect to the Parish G\nChurches, of the Malankara Church mentioned in Exhibit P4 and\nInstitutions of the Church.\nA\n. f. Direct respondents 5 to 13 to pay the cost of this petition to the\npetitioners.\"\nĮ\nH\nA\n880\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 4 S.C.R.\n2. One of the contentions which has been raised before the High Court\nwas the maintainability of the writ petition on the premise that it could not\nhave gone into the disputed questions of fact and, particularly, the application\nof the said judgment in relation to Parish Churches. Appellants, however,\nraised a contention that the writ petition was maintainable as the State and\nits officers having regard to the provisions contained in Article 144 of the\nB\nConstitution of India are duty bound to give effect to the decision of this\nCourt.\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n3. The High Court in view of the rival contention of the parties formulated\ntwo questions for its consideration:\n\"1. Are the contesting respondents bound by the judgment of\ntheir lordships of the Supreme Court in Most Rev. P.M.A. Metropolitan\nv. Moran Mar Marthoma, AIR (1995) SC 2001?\n2. Is a case for the issue of a writ of mandamus as prayed for by\nthe petitioners made out?\"\n4. Upon noticing the contentions raised on behalf of the parties,\nincluding the one that the appellants herein had raised claims over the\nproperties of the aforesaid Churches; in relation whereto there exists serious\ndispute and about 200 civil suits are pending in different courts in the State\nof Kerala.\n5. The High Court, however, went into the merit of the matter and\nopined that so far as the rights of Parish Churches are concerned, here was\nno declaration as against them, having not been impleaded in the proceedings\nbefore the Supreme Court. Having opined so, the High Court held:\n\"i. The rights of the Parish Churches were not determined by the\nSupreme Court in the 1995 decision. Thus, it cannot be said that the\ncontesting respondents have no right to manage their properties or\nthat the 1st petitioner has any right over the Churches which were not\nparties in the case;\nii. All the Churches listed in Exh. P-4 having not been impleaded as\nparties, no order affecting the rights of those who are not before the\nCourt can be passed;\nt\niii. The Churches had the right to form a separate Association. They\nwere also entitled to leave the Malankara Association under Arts, 19,\n;\n2\nរ\n:\nT\nMOHAN M. BASELIOS MARTHOMA MATHEWS Li v. STATE OF KERALA [S. B. SINHA, J.] 881\n25 and 26. It has not been shown that they had acted illegally in doing A\n1 so;\niv. Police help cannot be ordered for he mere asking. It involves\nexpense for the State. It is not a substitute for proceedings before an\nappropriate authority or court. It can be normally granted only when\nthere is clear evidence of an existing danger to person or property. In B\nmatters involving religious institutions, it would be normally\ninappropriate to order the grant of police protection unless a clear\ncase for allowing the entry of the police is made out;\nv. Keeping in view the peculiar facts and circumstances as noticed\nabove, no ground for the issue of a writ of mandamus as prayed for C\nby the petitioner is made out.\"\n6. Before we embark upon the rival contentions raised by the learned\ncounsel appearing on behalf of the parties before us, we may notice that\nAppellant No. 1 is said to have resigned from the post of Catholicos of the\nMalankara Metropolitan in 2005. He died on 26.1.2006. An application for D\nsubstitution has been filed by his successor who is Chief Catholico and\nMalanakra Metropolitan, which has been marked as I.A. No. 16 of 2006. The\nsaid substitution application is being opposed by the respondents herein\ncontending that the question in regard to the validity or otherwise of the\nelection of the Catholicos is pending consideration in a suit. Having regard\nto the fact that there exists dispute as to whether the appellicant herein is a\nvalidly elected person for holding the aforementioned post, and furthermore,\nin view of the fact that, in his absence, whether we can proceed with the\nappeals, we do not intend to pass any order in the substitution application.\nE\n7. The short question which arises for consideration, in our opinion, is F\nas to whether in a situation of this nature, the High Court should have gone\ninto the rival contentions of the parties. Our answer is 'No'. There cannot be\nany doubt whatsoever that prayer for issuance of a writ of mandamus may\nbe granted against the State commanding it to perform its legal duties when\nit fails and/or neglects to do so. It is, however, another thing that while\nG\nconsidering only that aspect of the matter, the Court in the garb of rendering\na decision on that limited aspect would go into the disputed question of title\nand/or interpretation of a judgment of this Court wherefor other remedies are\nnot only available but, as noticed hereinbefore, in fact, more than 200 suits,\ntouching one aspect of the matter or the other, are pending in different Civil\nCourts.\nH\nA\n882\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 4 S.C.R.\n14S.C.R.\n8. A distinction, in our opinion, must be borne in mind in regard to the\nexercise of jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India in\nrelation to the matters providing for public law remedy vis-à-vis private law\nremedy. The High Court while exercising its jurisdiction under Article 226 of\nthe Constitution, no doubt, exercises a plenary power but then certain limitations\nin regard thereto are well accepted. Ordinarily, a writ of or in the nature of\nmandamus would be issued against a ‘State' within the meaning of Article 12\nof the Constitution of India or the public authorities discharging public\nfunctions or a public utility concern or where the functions of the respondents\nare referable to a statute, which a fortiorari would mean that save and except\nfor good reasons Court would not entertain a matter involving private law\nC remedy.\nB\nᎠ\n9. The question as regards grant of a relief for providing police protection\nin a somewhat similar case, came up for consideration before this Court in P.\nR. Murlidharan \u0026 Ors. v. Swami Dharamananda Theertha Padar \u0026 Ors.,\n[2006] 4 SCC 501 wherein one of us was a party. It was held therein:\nE a\nF\nG\nH\n\"Furthermore, the jurisdiction of the civil court is wide and plenary.\nIn a case of this nature, a writ proceeding cannot be a substitute for\na civil suit.\"\n10. Balasubramanyan, J., in his concurring opinion observed:\n\"A writ petition under the guise of seeking a writ of mandamus\ndirecting the police authorities to give protection to a writ petitioner,\ncannot be made a forum for adjudicating on civil rights. It is one thing\nto approach the High Court, for issuance of such a writ on a plea that\na particular party has not obeyed a decree or an order of injunction\npassed in favour of the writ petitioner; was deliberately flouting that\ndecree or order and in spite of the petitioner applying for it, or that\nthe police authorities are not giving him the needed protection in\nterms of the decree or order passed by a court with jurisdiction. But,\nit is quite another thing to seek a writ of mandamus directing protection\nin respect of property, status or right which remains to be adjudicated\nupon and when such an adjudication can only be got done in a\nproperly instituted civil suit. It would be an abuse of process for a writ\npetitioner to approach the High Court under Article 226 of the\nConstitution seeking a writ of Mandamus directing the police\nauthorities to protect his claimed possession of a property without\nfirst establishing his possession in an appropriate civil court. The\nMOHAN M. BASELIOS MARTHOMA MATHEWS Li v. STATE OF KERALA [S. B. SINHA, J.] 883\ntemptation to grant relief in cases of this nature should be resisted by A\nthe High Court. The wide jurisdiction under Article 226 of the\nConstitution would remain effective and meaningful only when it is\nexercised prudently and in appropriate situations.\"\nB\n11. Learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents\nherein contend that the appellants before us cannot be permitted to take a\ndifferent stand now, nor can they be allowed to play fast and loose. The High\nCourt had arrived at its opinion only at their behest. Our attention in this\nbehalf has also been drawn even to the grounds taken by the appellants\nbefore us to contend that a writ of or in the nature of mandamus was sought\nfor enforcing the purported legal right of the appellant vis-à-vis the State and C\nits officers and not an against the private persons.\n12. Such might have been the contentions of the appellants before the\nHigh Court or before us in the special leave petitions, but we have no doubt\nin our mind that such disputed questions in regard to title of the properties\nor the right of one group against the other in respect of the management of D\nsuch a large number of Churches could not have been the subject matter for\ndetermination by a Writ Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India\nin the garb of grant of police protection to one or the other appellants.\n13. We, therefore, are of the opinion that despite the fact that the\nappellants had insisted upon before the High Court for issuance of a writ or E\nin the nature of mandamus upon the State or its officers for the purpose of\ngrant of police protection as this Court has exercised its appellate jurisdiction\nunder Article 136 of the Constitution of India, it can and should go into that\nquestion as well, viz. as to whether the writ petitioner itself could have been\nentertained or not, particularly, when the appeal is a continuation of the F\noriginal proceedings.\n14. Learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents\nwould moreover submit that different Benches of the High Court may take\ndifferent views in regard to the interpretation of the judgments of this Court\nin Most. Rev. P.M.A. Metropolitan (supra), and in support thereof has placed G\nbefore us a judgment of the learned Single Judge of the said Court in St.\nGeorge Jacobie Syrian Christian Church \u0026 Ors. v. State of Kerala \u0026 Ors.,\npassed in Writ Petition (c) No.32114/2006, wherein a view different from the\none taken by the Division Bench of he High Court of Kerala in the impugned\njudgment, has been taken. We, however, having regard to the opinion expressed\nH\n884\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 4 S.C.R.\nA hereinbefore and furthermore in view of the fact that, admittedly, a Letters\nPatent Appeal thereagainst has been filed by the aggrieved parties before the\nDivision Bench of the Kerala High Court, do not intend to go into the said\ncontention.\nB\n15. For the reasons stated hereinbefore, we are of the opinion that the\nHigh Court committed a manifest error in going into the disputed questions\nof title as also the disputed questions in regard to the rights of a particular\ngroup to manage the Churches, in exercise of its writ jurisdiction, particularly,\nwhen such questions are pending consideration before competent Civil Courts.\nWe, therefore, are of the opinion that any observation made by the High\nC Court should not influence the Courts concerned in arriving at their independent\ndecisions and in respect thereof, all contentions of the parties shall remain\nupon.\n16. We are making these observations, particularly in view of the fact\nthat even a large number of persons who have filed different suits in different\nD Courts of law were not parties before the High Court in the writ petition and\nthus any observation and findings of the High Court would otherwise also\nnot be binding on them.\nE\n17. It must be clarified that we have expressed no opinion on the merit\nof the issue pending before the Civil Courts.\nR. P.\n18. The appeals are disposed of accordingly.\n19. Application for impleadment is dismissed.\nAppeals disposed of.\n"}
