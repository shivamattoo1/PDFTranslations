He was survived by six sons and two daughters from two wives.\nAfter his death, the land in question was mutated in the names of his eight\nE\nF\nG\nH\n155\nB\nA\nB\n156\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 5 S.C.R.\nA children and each of them was given 1/8th share. In 1987, his two sons\ninstituted a suit for declaration and permanent injunction averring therein\nthat two daughters of the deceased had no right in the land and they could not\nhave inherited any share in the land since they were already married. The\nsuit was ultimately compromised. Names of the appellants were added as legal\nheirs from one of the daughters of the deceased who died in the year 1989. It\nis alleged by the appellants that respondent No.5 forged a Will purported to\nhave been executed by the deceased daughter before her death stating therein\nthat she was the full and absolute owner of 1/8th share which she inherited\nfrom her deceased father and that she had given the said share to respondent\nNo.5 who was her step-brother's son. On the basis of the said Will, respondent\nC No.5 applied to Tehsildar under the Delhi Land Revenue Act, 1954 to mutate\nthe land said to have been inherited by the deceased in the name of respondent\nNo.5 and to enter his name in the Revenue records. No notice was given to\nthe appellants nor principles of natural justice were complied with and\nTehsildar entered the name of respondent No. 5 in Revenue records by\neffecting mutation in the name of respondent No.5 in Khatauni. As soon as\nthe appellants came to know about the fact of mutation entry in Revenue\nrecords in favour of respondent No.5, they preferred an appeal to Collector.\nThe appeal was dismissed by the authority. A further appeal before the\nFinancial Commissioner, Delhi was also dismissed. A Writ petition to the\nHigh Court of Delhi was filed by the appellants, which was also dismissed.\nE Hence the present appeal.\nᎠ\nAppellants also alleged that in 1997-98, certain lands were acquired by\nthe Government under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 and an award was\npassed for Rs.3,60,00,000/-. Being heirs of the deceased, the appellants made\nan application under Sections 29-31 of the Act asserting that they were the\nF real heirs of deceased and were entitled to compensation of Rs. 45 lakhs, being\nthe share of the deceased and substantial amount of Rs. 45 lacs had been paid\nto respondent No. 5 on March 23, 1998. The said action was also challenged\nin the present appeal as illegal and unlawful.\nG\nAppellants further alleged that on April 22, 1998 they had instituted a\nsuit challenging validity and genuineness of the Will alleged to have been\nexecuted by the deceased daughter in favour of respondent No.5. The\nappellants, however, came to know that the Advocate who was engaged by the\nappellants and instructed to file a suit had not filed such suit for cancellation\nof Will. Hence, the appellants filed another suit. The said suit, however, was\nH dismissed by the Court on the ground of limitation. Aggrieved, the appellants\nSURAJ BHAN v. FINANCIAL COMMISSIONER\n157\npreferred an appeal which is pending in the High Court of Delhi. Appellants A\nhad also made complaint against the conduct on the part of Advocate in the\nBar Council of Delhi for his misconduct.\nDisposing of the appeal, the Court\nHELD: 1.1. The main question in the present appeal relates to B\ngenuineness or otherwise of Will dated April 14, 1989 said to have been\nexecuted by the deceased daughter in favour of respondent No. 5. The validity\nand genuineness of the Will can only be decided by a competent Civil Court.\nA suit had already been instituted in a Civil Court and though it was dismissed,\nthe order is subject matter of appeal pending in the appellate court. It is,\ntherefore, neither desirable or advisable to express any opinion on that question\nand as and when the matter will come up for hearing, it will be decided on its\nown merits by the High Court where it is pending. [Para 7] [160-H, 161-A-B]\nC\nD\n1.2. So far as mutation is concerned, it clear that entry has been made\nand mutation has been effected in Revenue Records by Tehsildar on the basis\nof an application made by respondent No.5 and his name has been entered in\nRecord of Rights on the basis of the Will said to have been executed by the\ndeceased daughter. Therefore, it cannot be said that by entering the name of\nrespondent No.5 in Revenue Records, any illegality had been committed by\nTehsildar. It is true that no notice was issued to the appellants but the\nTehsildar had taken the action on the basis of Will said to have been executed E\nby deceased daughter in favour of respondent No. 5. The said order has been\nconfirmed by the Collector as also by Financial Commissioner. When the\ngrievance was made against the said action by filing a Writ Petition, the High\nCourt also confirmed all the orders passed by Revenue Authorities under the\nAct. Hence, no infirmity is found so far as that part of the order is concerned.\n[Para 8] [161-C-D]\nF\n1.3. There is an additional reason for not interfering with the impugned\norder under Article 136 of the Constitution. It is well settled that an entry in\nRevenue Records does not confer title on a person whose name appears in\nRecord of Rights. It is settled law that entries in the Revenue Records or G\nJamabandi have only 'fiscal purpose' i.e. payment of land-revenue, and no\nownership is conferred on the basis of such entries. So far as title to the\nproperty is concerned, it can only be decided by a competent Civil Court. Civil\nProceedings in regard to genuineness of Will are pending with High Court\nof Delhi. In the circumstances, no reason is found to interfere with the order\nH\n158\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 5 S.C.R.\nA passed by the High Court in the writ petition. [Para 9] [161-E-F]\nJattu Ram v. Hakam Singh and Ors., AIR (1994) SC 1653, relied on.\n2.1. It is clarified that no opinion has been expressed on correctness on\ngenuineness of the Will said to have been executed by deceased in favour of\nB respondent No. 5. It was stated at the Bar that against dismissal of the suit by\nthe trial Court on the ground of limitation, an appeal is filed by the appellants\nwhich is pending before the High Court of Delhi. As and when the said appeal\nwill be taken up for hearing, it will be decided on its own merits without being\ninfluenced by observations made in this judgment.\nC\nD\nE\nF\n[Para 10] [161-G-H; 162-A]\n2.2 It is clarified further that no opinion has been expressed on the\nentitlement of compensation said to have been awarded in land acquisition\nproceedings. All contentions of all parties are kept open and all questions\nwill be decided in appropriate proceedings by Competent Authorities or Courts\nwithout being inhibited by the present decision.

Humayunisa, Kiran Bharadwaj,\nKumar Dushyant Singh, D.S. Mahra, Suruchii Aggarwal, Deepak Khosla, Ved\nP. Sarlonki and Amit Kumar (NP) for the Respondents.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nC.K. THAKKER, J. 1. Leave granted.\nG 2. The present appeal arises out of judgment and order passed by the\nHigh Court of Delhi on April 25, 2003 in Civil Writ No. 4560 of 1998. By the\nsaid order, the High Court confirmed the order passed by Revenue Authorities\nby which the name of respondent No. 5 was mutated in the Revenue Records.\n3. Shortly stated the facts are that one Data Ram was the common\nH ancestor of the appellants as also respondent No. 5. He was the owner of\nSURAJ BHAN v. FINANCIAL COMMISSIONER [C.K. THAKKEK, J.] 159\nB\nagricultural land admeasuring 216 Bighas and 19 Biswas comprised of several A\nKhasra numbers, situated in the Revenue Estate of village Bawana, Delhi.\nData Ram died in the year 1948. He was survived by six sons and two\ndaughters; three sons and one daughter from the first wife and three sons\nand one daughter from the second wife. Ratni Devi was a daughter from the\nsecond wife. After the death of Data Ram, the land was mutated in the names\nof his eight children and each of them was given 1/8th share. In 1987, two\nsons of Data Ram, namely, (i) Bhagwana, and (ii) Hari Singh instituted a suit\nNo. 81/87 for declaration and permanent injunction averring therein that two\ndaughters of deceased Data Ram, namely, (i) Smt. Jee Kaur, and (ii) Smt. Ratni\nDevi had no right in the land and they could not have inherited any share\nin the land since they were already married. The suit was ultimately C\ncompromised. Names of the appellants were added as legal heirs of Ratni Devi\nwho died on June 14, 1989. It is alleged by the appellants that respondent No.\n5 forged a Will purported to have been executed by Ratni Devi on April 14,\n1989 stating therein that she was the full and absolute owner of 1/8th share\nwhich she inherited from her father Data Ram and that she had given the said\nshare to respondent No. 5 who was her step-brother's son. On the basis of\nthe above Will, respondent No. 5 applied to Tehsildar, Narela, Delhi under the\nDelhi Land Revenue Act, 1954 to mutate the land said to have been owned\nby deceased Ratni Devi in the name of respondent No. 5 and to enter his\nname in the Revenue Records. No notice was given to the appellants, no\nopportunity of hearing was afforded, nor principles of natural justice were E\ncomplied with and Tehsildar entered the name of respondent No. 5 in Revenue\nRecords by effecting mutation in the name of respondent No. 5 in khatauni\non March 19, 1997. As soon as the appellants came to know about the fact\nof mutation entry in Revenue Records in favour of respondent No. 5, they\npreferred an appeal to Collector, North District, Kanjhawala, Delhi. The appeal,\nhowever, was dismissed. A further appeal before the Financial Commissioner, F\nDelhi also met with the same fate. A Writ Petition to the High Court of Delhi\nbeing C.W.P. No. 4560 of 1998 was, therefore, filed by the appellants. It was\nalso dismissed as observed earlier, against which the appellants have\napproached this Court.\nᎠ\nG\n4. It was also the case of the appellants that in 1997-98, certain lands\nwere acquired by the Government under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 and\nan award No. 1 of 1997 was passed for Rs.3,60,00,000/-. Being heirs of deceased\nRatni Devi, the appellants herein made an application under Sections 29-31\nof the said Act asserting that they were the real heirs of deceased Ratni Devi\nand were entitled to compensation of Rs. 45 lakhs, being the share of the H\n160\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 5 S.C.R.\nA deceased. In spite of the above facts, substantial amount of Rs.45 lacs had\nbeen paid to the respondent No. 5 on March 23, 1998. The said action was\nalso illegal and unlawful.\n5. It is asserted by the appellants that on April 22, 1998, the appellants\ninstituted a suit challenging validity and genuineness of the Will alleged to\nB have been executed by deceased Ratni Devi in favour of respondent No. 5.\nThe appellants, however, came to know that advocate Satbir Singh Gulia, who\nwas engaged by the appellants and instructed to file a suit had not filed such\nsuit for cancellation of Will. Hence, the appellants filed another suit being\nCivil Suit No. 79 of 2002. The said suit, however, was dismissed on the ground\nC of limitation. Being aggrieved by the dismissal of the suit, an appeal has been\ninstituted by the appellants which is pending in the High Court of Delhi.\nAccording to the appellants, all actions are taken contrary to law by respondent\nNo. 5 and the orders passed by the Authorities were violative of principles\nof natural justice and fair play. The High Court had also committed an error\nof law in dismissing the writ petition. They had also made complaint against\n▷ the conduct on the part of advocate Satbir Singh Gulia and filed a complaint\nin the Bar Council of Delhi for his misconduct. The appellants, therefore, have\nprayed that appropriate order be passed by this Court setting aside the orders\npassed by the Authorities by deleting the name of respondent No. 5 which\nhad been wrongfully entered in Record of Rights, by directing the Authorities\nto afford opportunity of hearing to the appellants and to take appropriate\naction in accordance with law. A prayer is also made to order respondent No.\n5 to deposit the entire amount received by him under the award with interest.\nE\n6. On April 1, 2004, when the matter was placed for admission hearing,\nlimited notice was issued on the question \"whether the original mutation was\nF done upon\nnotice to the natural heirs of Smt. Ratni Devi, the alleged testatrix\".\nThe matter was, thereafter, ordered to be placed for final hearing. Affidavits\nand further affidavits were filed. On December 9, 2005, notice was also issued\nto the Secretary, Bar Council of Delhi to state whether any complaint was filed\nby the complainant before the Bar Council and the status of that complaint.\nOn February 17, 2006, the Court noted that a complaint had been received by\nthe Bar Council from the appellants and was pending before the Bar Council.\nG\nH\n7. We have heard learned counsel for the parties. We have also perused\nthe relevant record. From the record, it is clear that the main question relates\nto genuineness or otherwise of Will dated April 14, 1989 said to have been\nexecuted by Ratni Devi in favour of respondent No. 5. The validity and\n་་\nSURAJ BHAN v. FINANCIAL COMMISSIONER [C.K. THAKKER, J.] 161\ngenuineness of the Will can only be decided by a competent Civil Court. A A\nsuit had already been instituted in a Civil Court and though it was dismissed,\nthe order is subject matter of appeal pending in the appellate court. It is,\ntherefore, neither desirable nor advisable to express any opinion on that\nquestion and as and when the matter will come up for hearing, it will be\ndecided on its own merits by the High Court where it is pending.\nB\n8. So far as mutation is concerned, it is clear that entry has been made\nand mutation has been effected in Revenue Records by Tehsildar on the basis\nof an application made by respondent No.5 herein and his name has been\nentered in Record of Rights on the basis of the Will said to have been\nexecuted by Ratni Devi. In our opinion, therefore, it cannot be said that by C\nentering the name of respondent No. 5 in Revenue Records, any illegality had\nbeen committed by Tehsildar. It is true that no notice was issued to the\nappellants but the Tehsildar had taken the action on the basis of Will said\nto have been executed by deceased Ratni Devi in favour of respondent No.\n5. The said order has been confirmed by the Collector as also by Financial\nCommissioner. When the grievance was made against the said action by filing D\na Writ Petition, the High Court also confirmed all the orders passed by\nRevenue Authorities under the Act. We see no infirmity so far as that part\nof the order is concerned.\nE\n9. There is an additional reason as to why we need not interfere with\nthat order under Article 136 of the Constitution. It is well settled that an entry\nin Revenue Records does not confer title on a person whose name appears\nin Record of Rights. It is settled law that entries in the Revenue Records or\nJamabandi have only 'fiscal purpose' i.e. payment of land-revenue, and no\nownership is conferred on the basis of such entries. So far as title to the\nproperty is concerned, it can only be decided by a competent Civil Court (vide F\nJattu Ram v. Hakam Singh and Ors., AIR (1994) SC 1653). As already noted\nearlier, Civil Proceedings in regard to genuineness of Will are pending with\nHigh Court of Delhi. In the circumstances, we see no reason to interfere with\nthe order passed by the High Court in the writ petition.\n10. For the foregoing reasons, the appeal deserves to be dismissed and G\nis accordingly dismissed. We may, however, clarify that we may not be\nunderstood to have expressed any opinion on correctness on genuineness of\nthe Will said to have been executed by deceased Ratni Devi in favour of\nrespondent No. 5. It was stated at the Bar that against dismissal of the suit\nby the trial Court on the ground of limitation, an appeal is filed by the\nH\nT\nr\n162\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 5 S.C.R.\nA appellants which is pending before the High Court of Delhi. As and when the\nsaid appeal will be taken up for hearing, it will be decided on its own merits\nwithout being influenced by observations made by us in this judgment. We\nmay also make it clear that we are not expressing any opinion on the entitlement\nof compensation said to have been awarded in land acquisition proceedings.\nAll contentions of all parties are kept open and all questions will be decided\nin appropriate proceedings by Competent Authorities or Courts without being\ninhibited by the present decision.\nB\n11. The appeal is accordingly disposed of. In the facts and circumstances\nof the case, however, there shall be no order as to costs.\nC\nS.K.S.\nAppeal disposed of.\nཟ\n"}
