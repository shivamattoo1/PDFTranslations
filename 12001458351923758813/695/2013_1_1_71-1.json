Where the Governor acts as the\nHead of the State, except in relation to areas which are\nearmarked under the Constitution as giving discretion to\nthe Governor, the exercise of power by him, must only\nbe upon the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers,\nfor the reason that the Governor, being the custodian of\nall executive and other powers under various provisions\nof the Constitution, is required to exercise his formal\nConstitutional powers, only upon, and in accordance\nwith, the aid and advice of his Council of Ministers. He\nis, therefore, bound to act under the Rules of Business\nE framed under Art. 166 (3) of the Constitution. The\nexpression, 'Business of the Government of India' in\nclause (3) of Art. 77, and the expression, 'Business of the\nGovernment of the State' in clause (3) of Art. 166, include\nall executive business. In the of Rules of Executive\nF Business, the topic involving the appointment of a\nLokayukta, must be brought before the Council of\nMinisters.

While Art. 163 provides that there shall be a\nCouncil of Ministers with the Chief Minister as the head,\nto aid and advise the Governor, in the exercise of his\nfunctions, an exception has been carved out with respect\nto situations wherein, he is, by or under the Constitution,\nrequired to perform certain functions by exercising his\nown discretion. The exceptions carved out in the main\nclause of Art. 163(1), permit the legislature to entrust\ncertain functions to the Governor to be performed by him,\neither in his discretion, or in consultation with other\nauthorities, independent of the Council of Ministers. The\nmeaning of the words 'by or under' is well settled.\nWhenever the Constitution intends to confer discretionary\npowers upon the Governor, or to permit him to exercise\nhis individual judgment, it has done so expressly.

The judgments of this Court do not leave any\nroom for doubt with respect to the fact that, when the\nGovernor does not act as a statutory authority, but as the\nHead of the State, being Head of the executive and\nappoints someone under his seal and signature, he is\nbound to act upon the aid and advice of the Council of\nMinisters. Thus, the law as evolved and applicable can\nbe summarised to the effect that the Governor is bound\nto act on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers,\nunless he acts as, “persona designata” i.e. “eo nomine”,\nunder a particular statute, or acts in his own discretion\nunder the exceptions carved out by the Constitution\nitself. Therefore, the appointment of the Lokayukta can\nbe made by the Governor, as the Head of the State, only\nwith the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers, and\nnot independently as a Statutory Authority.

In the instant case, the Governor has misjudged\nher role and has insisted that under the Act of 1986, the\nCouncil of Ministers has no role to play in the\nappointment of the Lokayukta, and that she could\ntherefore, fill it up in consultation with the Chief Justice\nof the High Court and the Leader of Opposition. Such\nH attitude is not in conformity, or in consonance with the\nSTATE OF GUJARAT v. HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE R. A. 15\nMEHTA (RETD) \u0026 ORS.\ndemocratic set up of government envisaged in our A\nConstitution. The Governor consulted the Attorney\nGeneral of India for legal advice, and communicated with\nthe Chief Justice of the High Court directly, without taking\ninto confidence, the Council of Ministers. In this respect,\nshe was wrongly advised to the effect that she had to act B\nas a statutory authority and not as the Head of the State.\nHowever, it is evident that the Chief Minister had full\ninformation and was in receipt of all communications\nfrom the Chief Justice, whose opinion is to be given\nprimacy as regards such matters, and can only be C\noverlooked, for cogent reasons. [para 74] [70-D-H]\n5.1. Courts should not make any undeserving or\nderogatory remarks against any person, unless the same\nare necessary for the purpose of deciding the issue\ninvolved in a given case. Even where criticism is justified,\nthe court must not use intemperate language and must\nmaintain judicial decorum at all times. Maintaining judicial\nrestraint and discipline are necessary for the orderly\nadministration of justice. Therefore, while formation and\nexpression of honest opinion and acting thereon, is a\nnecessity to decide a case, courts must always act within\nthe four-corners of the law.

At an earlier stage, the Chief Minister had taken\na stand to the effect that a retired Judge, who has been\ngiven some other assignment, should not be considered\nfor appointment to the post of Lokayukta. However, with\nrespect to the case of another retired Judge, he seems\nB to have taken an altogether different view. This Court is\nof the view that the Judge, even if he did not approve of\nthe attitude adopted by the Chief Minister, ought to have\nmaintained a calm disposition and should not have used\nsuch harsh language against a Constitutional authority,\ni.e. Chief Minister.

The facts and circumstances giving rise to these\nappeals are as under:\nA. The legislature of Gujarat enacted the Gujarat Lokayukta\nAct 1986 (hereinafter referred to as the, 'Act, 1986'), which\nprovided for the appointment of a Lokayukta, who must be a\nretired Judge of the High Court. The said statute, was given\neffect to, and various Lokayuktas were appointed over time, by\nfollowing the procedure prescribed under the Act, 1986, for the\nsaid purpose, i.e., the Chief Minister of Gujarat, upon\nconsultation with the Chief Justice of the Gujarat High Court,\nand the Leader of Opposition in the House, would make a\nrecommendation to the Governor, on the basis of which, the\nD Governor would then issue requisite letters of appointment.\nE\nF\nG\nB. The post of the Lokayukta became vacant on\n24.11.2003, upon the resignation of Justice S.M. Soni. The\nChief Minister, after the expiry of about three years, wrote a\nletter dated 1.8.2006 to the Chief Justice, suggesting the name\nof Justice K.R. Vyas for appointment to the post of Lokayukta.\nThe name of Justice K.R. Vyas was approved by the Chief\nJustice, vide letter dated 7.8.2006, and the Chief Minister, after\ncompleting other required formalities, forwarded the said name,\nto the Governor on 10.8.2006, seeking his approval, as regards\nappointment. The file remained pending for a period of 3 years,\nand was returned on 10.9.2009, as Justice K.R. Vyas had been\nappointed as Chairman of the Maharashtra State Human\nRights Commission, on 21.8.2007.\nC. On 29.12.2009, Private Secretary, to the Governor of\nGujarat, addressed a letter to the Registrar General of the High\nCourt of Gujarat, requesting that a panel of names be suggested\nby the Chief Justice, so that the same could be considered by\nthe Governor, with respect to their possible appointment, to the\nH post of Lokayukta.\n:\n"}
