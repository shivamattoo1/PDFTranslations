Bagaria, Rupesh Kumar and Tara Chandra Sharma for the Appellant. B\nP. Viswanatha Shetty, Sunita Rao, S.J. Aristotle, Shanti Bhushan and B.\nKrishna Prasad for the Respondent.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nC\nKAPADIA, J. 1. This civil appeal has been filed by M/s Sterlite Industries\n(India) Ltd. under section 130E of the Customs Act, 1962 against Order No.\n1113 of 2001 passed by CEGAT (\"the Tribunal\") on 13.7.2001.\n2. The short question which arises for determination in this civil appeal\nis whether Fully Automated Sequential X-ray Spectrometer is an apparatus D\nbased on the use of X-ray under sub-heading 9022.19 as claimed by the\nDepartment or whether the said apparatus is classifiable as Spectrometer\nunder sub-heading 9027.30 being an apparatus for physical or chemical analysis.\n3. To decide the above question, we quote hereinbelow the following\nHeading of Chapter 90 of the Customs Tariff Act, 1975 which reads as under: E\n“CHAPTER 90\nOPTICAL, PHOTOGRAPHIC, CINEMATOGRAPHIC, MEASURING,\nCHECKING, PRECISION, MEDICAL OR SURGICAL INSTRUMENT\nAND APPARATUS; PARTS AND ACCESSORIES THEREOF -\nF\nTariff\nItem\nDescription of goods\n9022\nApparatus based on the use\nof X-rays or of alpha, beta or\ngamma radiations, whether or\nnot for medical, surgical, dental\nor veterinary uses, including\nradiography or radiotherapy\napparatus, X-ray tubes and\nRate of duty\nStd.

The assessee imported Fully Automated Sequential X-ray Spectrometer\nfrom M/s Rigaku International Corporation, Japan. The said equipment is\nused by the assessee in its plant at Tuticorin. The said Spectrometer was\nimported for analyzing various alloys in the manufacture of Cathodes. The\nassessee filed its Bill of Entry for home consumption. They claimed assessment G\nunder sub-heading 9027.00. They claimed the benefit of partial exemption\nNotification No. 46/96-Cus dated 23.7.1996. They paid customs duty (basic at\n25% plus 10% additional customs duty). The Department, however, assessed\nthe above apparatus under sub-heading 9022.19, quoted above, read with the\nabove notification and charged customs duty (basic) at 50% ad valorem plus\nH\n88\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 4 S.C.R.\nA 10% additional customs duty.\nB\nC\n5. Basically, according to the Department, Spectrometer in the present\ncase was X-ray based Spectrometer and, therefore, the same was classifiable\nin sub-heading 9022.19. According to the Department, X-ray based apparatus\nstood covered under section XVIII of HSN also and, therefore, the goods\nwere classifiable under sub-heading 9022.19.\n6. According to the assessee, in the present case, the Spectrometer in\nquestion is specifically named in sub-heading 9027.30. According to the\nassessee, the Department had erred in placing reliance on HSN when the\nCustoms Tariff Act, 1975 has specifically laid down Rules of interpretation.\nAccording to the assessee, Rule 3(a) of the Rules of Interpretation was\napplicable which says that the heading which provides a specific description\nshall be preferred to headings which provide general description. According\nto the assessee, under Heading 90.27 the above item Spectrometer has been\nmentioned without any qualification regarding the source material and,\nD therefore, the Spectrometer is based on optical source, the X-ray source was\nE\nF\nimmaterial as Spectrometer per se was classifiable under sub-heading 9027.30.\nBefore us, the assessee submitted, in the alternative, for the first time, that\nthe above Fully Automated Sequential X-ray Spectrometer could fall under\nsub-heading 9027.80 as Special Apparatus.\n7. We have gone through the literature/brochure concerning Fully\nAutomated Sequential X-ray Spectrometer. We find from the brochure that the\nabove System which is imported by the assessee is multi-functional. It has\nan inbuilt software. It has an inbuilt automatic analysis program. It is the\nsoftware in the System which makes the system carry out multi-purpose\nfunctions. The computer processes the data. The configurations are also\nspecified in the assembly of the Spectrometer. Prima facie it appears that\nthere is an inbuilt computer system in the Spectrometer. That computer appears\nto be an essential part of direct reading. These aspects have not been\nconsidered by the authorities below. The catalogue/brochure produced\nindicates that the Spectrometer in question would be non-functional without\nG the computer. Modern direct reading Spectrometer incorporates a computer in\nthe System so that they can measure, process and analyse the data. The\ncatalogue shows the configurations which indicate prima facie that the\ncomputer stands integrated with the Spectrometer. The catalogue indicates\nthe type of apparatus. The catalogue shows inclusion of software programmes\nand computer. The catalogue shows that the Spectrometer is so designed that\nH\ni\n1\n'\n'\nJ\nSTERLITE INDUSTRIES (INDIA) LTD. 1. COMMNR. OF CUSTOMS, CHENNAI [KAPADIA, J.] 89\nit functions in an integrated manner along with the computer and can be A\noperated and controlled only with such computer. None of these aspects had\nbeen considered by the authorities below including the Tribunal. Hence, we\nremit the matter to the Tribunal to decide the matter de novo after examining\nthe catalogue annexed as Annexure-B in its records. Before concluding, we\nmay mention that our above opinion should not be treated as conclusive. The\nᏴ\nTribunal can also consider the alternative submission of the assessee, namely,\nthat the above item can fall also within sub-heading 9027.80. In this regard\nwe express no opinion.\n8. For the above reasons, the impugned order dated 13.7.2001 of the\nTribunal (CEGAT) is set aside and the matter is remitted to the Tribunal for\nits fresh decision in accordance with law after examining the catalogue annexed\nin its record.\n9. This appeal is accordingly allowed with no order as to costs.\nC\nR.P.\nAppeal allowed.\nD\n"}
