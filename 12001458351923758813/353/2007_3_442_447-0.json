Thus the\nlegal possession is retained by a partner who was one of the original tenants.\nIn these circumstances, in view of the principles laid down by this Court, the\nHigh Court rightly held that there was no sub-letting of the premises and,\ntherefore, the suit for eviction deserved to be dismissed.

No. 231/1995 \u0026 F.A. No. 232/1995.\nRakesh Dwivedi, Aruneshwar Gupta, Naveen Kumar Singh, Vimla Sinha,\nAmit Kr. Singh for the Appellant.\nKailash Vasdev, I.S. Alag, J.S. Lamba, Bhuwan Puri, Amit Bhagat, Pradeep\nKumar Bakshi for the Respondent.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered\nD\nE\nF\n1. The appellant in these appeals by special leave is the landlord who\nfiled a suit for eviction of the respondent tenant from the premises in question.\nThe tenancy was created in favour of the respondent firm which consisted G\nof four partners.\n2. The eviction of the respondent was sought on the ground that the\ndefendant had sub-let, assigned and/or transferred possession of the said\npremises and/or part thereof to Dhillon Transport Quick Service and Dhillon\nRoadways Corporation and others consent in writing of the plaintiff landlord. H\n444\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 3 S.C.R.\nA In its written statement the tenant denied the allegation of sub tenancy and\nsubmitted that M/s Dhillon Transport Agency, a partnership firm was originally\nthe tenant. The partnership had four partners who carried on business in the\nname and style of Dhillon transport Agency. Since disputes and differences\narose amongst the partners, Title Suit No. 19 of 1991 was filed in the Court\nof the 1st Subordinate Judge at Patna and all matters were settled by\ncompromise. Consequently. The firm was dissolved and one of the partners\nwas given all the assets of the firm and he formed another firm with himself\nas one of the partners. It was averred that unless the tenancy was transferred\nby such partner to a third party, it would not amount to sub-letting. The\ndefendant therefore aserted that there was no sub-letting since one of the\nC partners, Ajit Singh continued to occupy the premises having legal possession\nthereof.\nB\n3. In his deposition PW-1, Ajit Singh deposed that the tenancy was\noriginally created in favour of the firm of which he was one of the partners.\nThe firm was running a transport agency business in the suit premises and\nD had never inducted any sub tenant in the suit premises. In his corss\nexamination it was elicited that the partnership firm originally consisting of\nfour partners existed for about 35 to 40 years. He denied the suggestion that\nhe was not looking after the affairs of the defendant and that it inducted other\npersons and/or firm for carrying on business in the suit premises by the name\nof Dhillon Quick Transport Service or Dhillon Roadways Corporation. He\nasserted that he looks after the affairs of the partnership firm which is carrying\non business in the premises of which he is a partner.\nE\n4. It appears that along with his written submission, the plaintiff filed\ncertain documents which were not exhibited at the trial to prove sub-letting.\nF In our view those documents cannot be looked into since they were not put\nin evidence and the defendant had no opportunity of replying to those\ndocuments.\n5. The trial Court decreed the suit for eviction but its judgment and\norder has been set aside by the High Court. The High Court after appreciating\nG the evidence on record has found that since one of the partners of the original\nH\ntenant namely, the firm Dhillon Transport Agency, is still running his transport\nagency business in the same premises, it cannot be held that a sub-tenancy\nhas been created. The High Court, therefore, held that the appellant had failed\nto prove sub-letting of premises by the respondent.\n6. In the Special Leave Petition filed by the appellants two questions\nէ\n一张\nAMAR NATH AGARWALLA v. DHILLON TRANSPORT AGENCY 445\nof law have been formulated which read as follows:-\nA\n(a) If it is an admitted fact that the firm (with four partners) in favour\nof which lease/tenancy was granted as dissolved, as a result whereof\nthe three resigning partners devolved and/or transferred and/or\nassigned their interest in the tenancy/lease rights in favour of one of\nth partner who continued as owner of the firm, whether such an B\nassignment/devolution/transfer of the lease rights without obtaining\nthe consent of the landlord ipso facto amounts to sub-letting by the\nresigning partners?\n(b) If dissolution of the partnership firm and devolution and/or transfer\nand/or assignment of the same by the resigning partners in favour of C\nthe surviving partner is an admitted fact, whether any further evidence\nis required to be submitted by the plaintiff-landlord to establish sub-\nletting?\n7. As would be apparent from a mere reading of the submissions urged\nᎠ\non behalf of the appellant, after dissolution of the firm all the rights of the\ntenant firm including tenancy rights had been transferred to one of the\npartners who has continued as the owner of the firm in occupation. The\nquestion is whether carrying on business by one of the partners of the firm\nwhich was originally the tenant amounts to sub-letting of the premises by the\noriginal tenant.\n8. In Murli Dhar v. Chuni Lal and Ors., (1969) RCR 563 this Court had\nrepelled the contention that the old firm and the new firm being two different\nlegal entities, the occupation of the shop by the new firm was occupation by\nthe legal entity other than the original tenant and such occupation proved\nsub-letting. Repelling the contention this Court held:-\n(I)\nE\nF\n\"This contention is entirely without substance. A firm, unless expressly\nprovided for the purpose of any statute which is not the case here,\nis not a legal entity. The firm name is only a compendious way of\ndescribing the partners of the firm. Therefore, occupation by a firm is\nonly occupation by its partners. Here the firms have a common partner. G\nHence the occupation has been by one of the original tenants.\"\n9. In Mohammedkasam Haji Gulambhai v. Bakerali Fatehali (Dead)\nby LRs., Reported in [1998] 7 SCC 608 this Court observed:\nH\n446\nA\nB\nC\nᎠ\n(1)\nE\nF\nG\nH\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 3 S.C.R.\n\"There is absolute prohibition on the tenant from sub-letting, assigning\nor transferring in any other manner his interest in the tenanted premises. +\nThere appears to be no way around this subject of course if there is\nany contract to the contrary between the landlord and the tenant. In\na partnership where the tenant is a partner, he retains legal possession\nof the premises as a partnership is a compendium of the names of all\nthe partners. In a partnership, the tenant does not divest himself of\nhis right in the premises. On the question of sub-letting etc. the law\nis now very explicit. There is prohibition in absolute terms on the\ntenant from sub-letting, assignment or disposition of his interest in\nthe tenanted premises.\"\n10. The same principle was reiterated by this Court in Mahendra Saree\nEmporium (II) v. G.V. Srinivasa Murthy, reported in [2005] 1 SCC 481 wherein\nthis Court held:\n\"The mere fact that another person is allowed to use the premises\nwhile the lesses retains the legal possession is not enough to create\na sub lease. Thus, the thrust is, as laid down by this Court, on finding\nout who is in legal possession of the premises. So long as the legal\npossession remains with the tenant the mere factum of the tenant\nhaving entered into partnership for the purpose of carrying on the\nbusiness in the tenancy premises would not amount to sub-letting. In\nParvinder Singh v. Renu Gautam a three-Judge Bench of this Court\ndevised the test in these terms: (SCC P. 799, Para 8)\n\"If the tenant is actively associated with the partnership business\nand retains the use and control over the tenancy premises with him,\nmay be along with the partners, the tenant may not be said to have\nparted with possession. However, if the user and control of the tenancy\npremises has been parted with and deed of partnership has been\ndrawn up as an indirect method of collecting the consideration for\ncreation of sub-tenancy or for providing a cloak or cover to conceal\na transaction not permitted by law, the Court is not estopped from\ntearing the veil of partnership and finding out the real nature of\ntransaction entered into between the tenant and the alleged sub-\ntenant.\"\n11. Applying these principle to the instant case, it is patent that one\nof the partners of the firm which was the original tenant has continued in legal.\nAMAR NATH AGARWALLA v. DHILLON TRANSPORT AGENCY 447\npossession of the premises as a partner of another firm constituted after A\ndissolution of the original firm. Thus the legal possession is retained by a\npartner who was one of the original tenants. In these circumstances, we find\nno fault with the finding of the High Court there was no sub-letting of the\npremises and hence the suit for eviction deserved to be dismissed.\n12. There is not merit in these appeals and the same are accordingly\ndismissed.\nR.P.\nAppeal Dismissed.\nB\n"}
