Thirdly, the impact of construction of high-rise buildings A\nin the thickly populated areas on the traffic in the city was also\ndiscussed during the consideration of the SLP. The Court noted\nin paragraph 14 of the order, that although additional space for\npublic parking was being provided, simultaneously higher FSI\nwas also being granted to the developer, on that count.\nConsequently, such high-rise buildings would add more number\nof vehicles on the adjoining streets. This required examination\nof the impact of additional FSI on the traffic situation, particularly\nin the island city of Greater Mumbai.\n10. Lastly, considering that the height of the complex was\ngoing up to 198.50 meters, it was decided to look into the issue\nof hazards due to fire which the occupants of such towers could\nface. It was noted that there were provisions with respect to the\nspace to be kept around such buildings for the movement of\nfire engines within the compound of such buildings, but these\nprovisions are not uniform. The fire engines, with their ladders,\navailable with the Municipal Corporation, do not reportedly reach\nanywhere beyond 14th floor. It was also noted that recently the\nSecretariat Building of the State of Maharashtra (known as the\n‘Mantralaya') was engulfed with fire. The building is only six\nstoreys, and yet it took quite a few days to control the fire, and\nin that exercise a few lives were unfortunately lost. Therefore,\nthe issue of safety of the occupants of such high-rise buildings,\nthat of the residents in the neighbourhood, and the firemen,\nrequired urgent consideration.\n11. Therefore, in Part-II of its order dated 25.7.2013, the\nBench framed four issues for further consideration. These\nissues read as follows:-\n\"(1) What should be the correlation between DCR 23 and\nDCR 38(34) regarding the recreational area? Is it\npermissible to reduce the minimum recreational area\nprovided under DCR 23 on any ground?\n(2) Whether the exemption from DCR 31(1) under DCR\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nI\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\n1138 SUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2013] 16 S.C.R.\nNos. 33(7), (8), and (9) is justified, valid and legal\nparticularly in the island city of Greater Mumbai. If so, to\nwhat extent and in which context?\n(3) What is the impact of the addition of FSI in the island\ncity on the traffic situation? How can it be controlled?\n(4) Whether the present mechanism for protection against\nthe fire hazards is adequate and is being implemented\neffectively? If not, what should be the mechanism for\nenforcement with respect to the provisions concerning the\nfire safety?\n12. For that purpose, affidavits were sought from the\nfollowing:-\n\"(A) From the Municipal Corporation:-\n(i) The affidavit of the Chief Engineer, Town Planning on\nissues no. 1 and 2.\n(ii) The affidavit of the Chief Engineer, concerning traffic\non issued no. 3.\n(iii) The affidavit of the Chief Fire Officer on issue no 4.\n(B) From the State of Maharashtra:-\nF\n(i) By the Secretary, Urban Development Department on\nissue nos. 1, 2 and 3 above.\nG\n(ii) By the Commissioner of Police (Traffic) on issue no.\n3 above.\"\n13. The excessive construction at the cost of minimum\nrecreational space, as seen in the present case, required an\nimmediate attention to be paid to issue no. (1).. Similarly, issue\nno. (4). concerning the fire hazards also required urgent\nattention, and it was thought that the Court should go into the\nH legality of the relevant provisions in this behalf. As against that,\nMUNICIPAL COPRN. OF GREATER MUMBAI v. KOHINOOR CTNL 1139\nINFRASTRUCTURE COMPANY PVT. LTD. [H.L. GOKHALE, J.]\nA\nB\nexamination of the other two issues was taken up for the reason\nthat the development plan for the city of Mumbai is going to be\nrevised shortly, and certain suggestions in that behalf could be\nmade. Issue no. (2). arising out of exemptions to the high-rise\nbuildings under DCR 33(7),(8), (9) and issue no. (3) concerning\nthe impact on traffic, required a detailed deliberation. At this\npoint, it is relevant to mention that a similar approach has been\nadopted by this Court in Municipal Corporation of Delhi Vs.\nAssociation of victims of Uphaar Tragedy \u0026 Ors. reported in\nAIR 2012 SC 100. That case concerned the compensation to\nbe paid to the victims of the fire in the 'Upahaar' theatre at C\nDelhi. This Court decided the issue of compensation in\nparagraph 38 of the judgment. However, the Court could not\nignore that the fire had resulted into the death of 59 persons.\nand injury to 103 persons, and therefore, this Court observed\nin paragraph 39 of the said judgment:-\n\"39. Normally we would have let the matter rest there. But\nhaving regard to the special facts and circumstances of\nthe case we propose to proceed a step further to do\ncomplete justice.\n\"1\nAnd then, the Court made a number of suggestions in\nparagraph 45 of its judgment to the Government for its\nconsideration and implementation. Similarly, although a\nsettlement is arrived at, on the controversy between the parties\nbefore the Court, considering the acute problems in the city of\nMumbai with respect to shortage of recreational space, the fire\nhazards and high density of traffic, a further deliberation on the\nabove referred four issues was felt necessary.\nD\nE\nF\nG\n14. Thereafter, the matter has been heard by the present\nBench. Consequent upon the above order, the necessary\naffidavits were filed by the officers of the appellant as well as\nthe State of Maharashtra. A number of interveners have also\nassisted the Court. The interveners include (i) The Urban\nDesign Research Institute ('UDRI' for short) \u0026 Ors., (ii)\nMaharashtra Chamber of Housing Industry, (iii) Practicing H\n1140 SUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2013] 16 S.C.R.\nA Engineers Architects and Town Planners Association (India)\nand (iv) Property Redevelopers Association. They have all\nassisted in the examination of these four issues. We will deal\nwith their submissions in the context of the Maharashtra\nRegional and Town Planning Act, 1966 (the 'MRTP' Act for\nB short), and the Development Control Regulations for Greater\nMumbai, 1991, framed thereunder which govern these issues.\nC\nIssue no.1 concerning the reduction in the minimum\nrecreational space from the one as required under\nDCR 23:-\n15. The Development Control Regulations are referable to\nSection 22(m) of the MRTP Act. Section 21 of the said Act\nrequires the planning authority, i.e. the local authority (appellant\nno. 1 in the instant case) to prepare a development plan for the\nD local area within its jurisdiction. Section 22 of the Act lays down\nwhat should be the contents of a development plan, and in that\nbehalf it provides under sub-section (m) that it shall contain\namongst others:-\nE\n\"(m) provision for permission to be granted for controlling\nand regulating the use and development of land within\n*he jurisdiction of a local authority.....\"\nThe present DCR's for Greater Mumbai, 1991 were\nsanctioned by the State of Maharashtra on 20.2.1991 and are\nF enforced from 25.3.1991. The new DCR's are shortly to be\nformulated for the next twenty years.\nG\nH\nThe DCR 23 on recreational amenity open spaces:-\n16. The DCR 23 with which we are concerned in the first\nissue reads as follows:-\n\"23. Recreational/Amenity Open Spaces:-\n(1) Open spaces in residential and commercial layouts—\nMUNICIPAL COPRN.

As has been noted in paragraph 13 of the order dated\n25.7.2013, the appellants did not look into the issue of reduction\nin recreational area at the ground level very seriously, probably\nbecause the rule permits recreational space on the podium.\nSome of the interveners very seriously canvassed that in view\nof the provision concerning recreational space on the podium,\nthe recreational / amenity open space at the ground level could\nlegitimately be reduced. The provision regarding the podium\nis seen in DCR No. 38 (34). DCR 38 lays down the\nMUNICIPAL COPRN. OF GREATER MUMBAI v. KOHINOOR CTNL 1145\nINFRASTRUCTURE COMPANY PVT. LTD. [H.L. GOKHALE, J.]\nrequirements concerning parts of buildings. DCR 38 (34) reads A\nas follows:-\n\"(34) Podium.\n(i) A podium may be permitted on plot admeasuring\n1500 sq.mt. or more.\n(ii) The podium provided with ramp may be permitted in\none or more level, total height not exceeding 24 m. above\nground level.\nHowever, podium not provided with ramp but provided with\ntwo car lifts may be permitted in one or more level, total\nheight not exceeding 9 mt. above ground level.\n(iii) The podium shall be used for the parking of vehicles.\n(iv) The recreational space prescribed in D.C.

As far as the issue no. 1 is concerned, this Court had\nsought the affidavit from the Chief Engineer, Town Planning of\nthe appellant-Municipal Corporation, and from the Secretary,\nUrban Development Department of the State of Maharashtra.\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n1146 SUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2013] 16 S.C.R.\nA Shri Manu Kumar Srivastava, Principal Secretary to the\nGovernment of Maharashtra in the Urban Development\nDepartment has filed an affidavit affirmed on 6.9.2013. In para\n4.4 he has stated as follows:-\nB\nC\n“4.4) I submit that in quite a few cases, the requirements\nof captive parking for the building can be met only by\nproviding the same in basement or on upper parking\nfloors or podium, which in turn requires provision of\naccess / ramps etc., which often makes it difficult to\nprovide the required Recreational / Amenity open spaces\non the ground......\"\nThereafter, he has stated that it is to overcome this difficulty\nthat the DCRs have been amended with effect from 6.1.2012\nto allow recreational spaces on podium in plots admeasuring.\nD 1500 sq. mts. or more. In his affidavit he has pointed out that\nin the redevelopment projects under DCR 33(7) for\nreconstruction of cessed buildings, and for the urban renewal\nschemes under DCR 33(9), and for the slum rehabilitation\nprojects under DCR 33(10), it is permissible to reduce the\nE Recreational / Amenity open spaces to the limit prescribed in\nthe respective regulations. He has stated that this has been\ndone consciously to facilitate these schemes.\nF\nG\nH\n19. On behalf of the appellant-Municipal Corporation Shri\nRajeev Kuknur, Chief Engineer (Development Plan) has\naffirmed his reply on 6.9.2013. In paragraph 6, thereof, he has\nalso stated that the provision for parking on podium has been\nmade to facilitate the requirement of parking. He has, however,\nadded \"in such situation it may not be possible for the planner\nto provide the entire Recreational/Amenity space on the\nground\". Later in paragraph 7, he has pointed out that in certain\nother situations the amenity open spaces are permitted to be\nreduced. Thus, under DCR 33(1) read with Clause 6.20 of\nAppendix IV which applies to the redevelopment schemes for\nslums, the amenity space can be reduced, but still a minimum\n"}
