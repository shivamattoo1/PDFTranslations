PALAK MODI\n629\nA\nThe private respondents were appointed as\nProbationary Officers in the appellant-bank in the year\n2006. In 2010, they were informed that they are due for\nconfirmation and, were therefore, required to appear in a\nconfirmation test. The private respondents appeared in\nthe test, and subsequently the result thereof was B\ndeclared. The names of the private respondents did not\nfigure in the result apparently because the Institute of\nBanking Personnel Selection ('IBPS'), an independent\nexpert body engaged in conducting recruitment for\nvarious services, which was entrusted with the task of C\npreparing the examination papers and evaluating the\nanswer sheets sent a report to the Bank that some\ncandidates including the private respondents were\nsuspected to have used unfair means.\nD\nThe probation of the private respondents was\nextended for three months by invoking Rule 16(2) of the\nState Bank of India (Officers' Service) Rules, 1992.\nHowever, prior to expiry of the extended period of\nprobation, the services of the private respondents was\nterminated under Rule 16(3) of the State Bank of India E\n(Officers' Service) Rules, 1992. The private respondents\nchallenged the termination of their services by filing writ\npetitions mainly on the grounds that the action taken by\nthe concerned authorities of the Bank was arbitrary and\nviolative of the rules of natural justice. They pleaded that F\nduring the period of probation, no one had informed them\nabout any shortcoming, deficiency or defect in their work\nand yet their services were terminated without giving\nthem notice and opportunity of hearing. The private\nrespondents further pleaded that even though they had G\nrequested the concerned officers of the Bank to disclose\nthe reasons for extension of probation and termination\nof their services but no response was received from\nthem.\nH.\nA\n630 SUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2012] 12 S.C.R.\nThe High Court did not directly deal with the question\nwhether the action taken by the General Manager was\narbitrary, unfair and unjustified and whether in the garb\nof termination simpliciter, the concerned authority had\npenalized the private respondents on the charge of their\nB having indulged in malpractices in the confirmation test\nbut held that the action taken by the appellants was\ncontrary to the guidelines framed by the IBPS for\ndetecting cases of use of unfair means. The High Court\nreferred to paragraph 4 of the guidelines framed by the\nIBPS and opined that after considering the report\nsuggesting that the private respondents were suspected\nto have used unfair means in the examination, the Bank\nshould have scrutinized their cases on the basis of their\nperformance in the descriptive papers and then taken a\nfinal decision. The High Court held that the Bank could\nnot have discharged the private respondents from service\nby assuming that they had used unfair means in the\nobjective type papers.\nC\nD\nWhether the alleged use of unfair means by the\nE private respondents in the confirmation test held by\nappellant-Bank constituted the foundation of the\ndecision taken to terminate their services under Rule\n16(3) of the State Bank of India (Officers' Service) Rules,\n1992 is the question which arose for consideration in the\nF instant appeals.\nG\nH\nDismissing the appeals, the Court\nHELD: 1.1. A probationer has no right to hold the\npost and his service can be terminated at any time during\nor at the end of the period of probation on account of\ngeneral unsuitability for the post held by him. If the\ncompetent authority holds an inquiry for judging the\nsuitability of the probationer or for his further continuance\nin service or for confirmation and such inquiry is the\nSTATE BANK OF INDIA v. PALAK MODI\n631\nbasis for taking decision to terminate his service, then the A\naction of the competent authority cannot be castigated\nas punitive. However, if the allegation of misconduct\nconstitutes the foundation of the action taken, the\nultimate decision taken by the competent authority can\nbe nullified on the ground of violation of the rules of B\nnatural justice. [Para 20] [656-A-C]\nC\nD\n1.2. A combined reading of Rules 15(1) and 16 of the\nState Bank of India (Officers' Service) Rules, 1992 and\nparagraph 5 of the conditions of appointment makes it\nclear that a person appointed as a Probationary Officer\nremains on probation for a minimum period of two years\nat the end of which he is entitled to be confirmed if the\ncompetent authority is of the opinion that he has\nsatisfactorily completed the training in any institution to\nwhich he may have been deputed and the in-service\ntraining in the Bank. The Probationary Officer can also be\nsubjected to screening for judging his merit and\nsuitability. If the Probationary Officer fails to satisfactorily\ncomplete the training(s) or fails to pass the screening test\nor his service is not satisfactory, then the Bank can E\nextend the period of probation by a further period of\nwhich the outer limit is one year. In a given case, the\ncompetent authority can, if it is of the opinion that the\nProbationary Officer is not fit for confirmation, terminate\nhis service by one month's notice or payment of one F\nmonth's emoluments. It is thus evident that satisfactory\nperformance during the period of probation, successful\ncompletion of training(s) and passing of the test\nconducted by the Bank for judging his suitability for the\npost constitute the touchstone for his confirmation. G\n[Paras 22, 23] [669-G-H; 670-A-D]\n1.3. The primary object of the confirmation test held\non 27.2.2011, which could also be termed as evaluation\ntest within the meaning of paragraph 5(c) of the\nH\n632 SUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2012] 12 S.C.R.\nA appointment letter was to decide whether the officer has\nmade use of the opportunities made available to him by\nthe Bank to prove his worth for the job for which he was\nrecruited and whether he has acquired sufficient\nknowledge about the functional requirements of the\nB Bank. The test also gave an opportunity to the\nProbationary Officer to demonstrate that he was\nmeritorious enough to be placed in the higher grade.\n[Para 25] [670-G-H; 671-A-B]\nC\n1.4. There is a marked distinction between the\nconcepts of satisfactory completion of probation and\nsuccessful passing of the training/test held during or at\nthe end of the period of probation, which are sine qua\nnon for confirmation of a probationer and the Bank's right\nto punish a probationer for any defined misconduct,\nD misbehaviour or misdemeanor. In a given case, the\ncompetent authority may, while deciding the issue of\nsuitability of probationer to be confirmed, ignore the\nact(s) of misconduct and terminate his service without\ncasting any aspersion or stigma which may adversely\nE affect his future prospects but, if the misconduct/\nmisdemeanor constitutes the basis of the final decision\ntaken by the competent authority to dispense with the\nservice of the probationer albeit by a non stigmatic order,\nthe Court can lift the veil and declare that in the garb of\nF termination simpliciter, the employer has punished the\nemployee for an act of misconduct. [Para 26] [671-B-E]\nG\nH\n1.5. The use of unfair means in the evaluation test/\nconfirmation test held by the Bank certainly constitutes\na misconduct. The Bank itself had treated such an act to\nbe a misconduct (paragraph 10 of advertisement dated\n1.7.2008). The services of the private respondents were\nnot terminated on the ground that there was any\ndeficiency or shortcoming in their work or performance\nduring probation or that they had failed to satisfactorily\nSTATE BANK OF INDIA v. PALAK MODI\n633\nC\ncomplete the training or had failed to secure the qualifying A\nmarks in the test held on 27.2.2011. The note prepared by\nthe Deputy General Manager, which was approved by the\nGeneral Manager makes it crystal clear that the decision\nto dispense with the services of the private respondents\nwas taken solely on the ground that they were guilty of B\nusing unfair means in the test held on 27.2.2011. The\nfoundation of the action taken by the General Manager\nwas the accusation that while appearing in the objective\ntest, the private respondents had resorted to copying.\nIBPS had relied upon the analysis made by the computer\nand sent report to the Bank that 18 candidates were\nsuspected to have used unfair means. The concerned\nauthority then sent for the chart of seating arrangement\nand treated the same as a piece of evidence for coming\nto the conclusion that the private respondents had\nindeed used unfair means in the examination. This\nexercise was not preceded by an inquiry involving the\nprivate respondents and no opportunity was given to\nthem to defend themselves against the charge of use of\nunfair means. In other words, they were condemned\nunheard which was legally impermissible. [Para 27] [671-\nF-H; 672-A-D]\nD\nE\nAjit Singh v.
