{"pages":[{"pageNumber":51}],"text":"GOVINDARAJU @ GOVINDA v. STATE BY\nSRIRAMAPURAM P.S. [SWATANTER KUMAR, J.]\n117\nwitnesses turn hostile, but where the statement of the Police A\nOfficer itself is unreliable then it may be difficult for the Court\nto accept the recovery as lawful and legally admissible. The\nofficial acts of the Police should be presumed to be regularly\nperformed and there is no occasion for the courts to begin with\ninitial distrust to discard such evidence.\n47. In the present case, on a cumulative reading and\nappreciation of the entire evidence on record, we are of the\nconsidered view that the learned trial Court had not fallen in\nerror of law or appreciation of evidence in accordance with law.\nThe High Court appears to have interfered with the judgment\nof acquittal only on the basis that 'there was a possibility of\nanother view'. The prosecution must prove its case beyond any\nreasonable doubt. Such is not the burden on the accused. The\nHigh Court has acted on certain legal and factual presumptions\nwhich cannot be sustained on the basis of the record before\nus and the principle of laws afore-noticed. The case of the\nprosecution, thus, suffers from proven improbabilities,\ninfirmities, contradictions and the statement of the sole witness,\nthe Police Officer, PW1, is not reliable and worthy of credence.\n48. For the reasons afore-recorded and the view that we\nhave taken, it is not necessary for us to deal with the legal\nquestion before us as to what would be the effect in law of the\nacquittal of Govardhan attaining finality, upon the case of the\npresent appellant Govindaraju. We leave the question of law,\nPoint No.7 open.\n49. For the reasons afore-stated, we allow the present\nappeal acquitting the appellant of the offence under Section\n302 IPC. He be set at liberty forthwith and his bail and surety\nbonds shall stand discharged.\nN.J.\nAppeal allowed.\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\n"}
