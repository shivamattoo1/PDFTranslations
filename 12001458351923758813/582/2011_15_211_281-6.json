SRI\nSEETARAM RICE MILL [SWATANTER KUMAR, J.]\n271\nA\ncharges or disconnect electricity has been held not violative\neven of Article 14 of the Constitution of India. The expression\n'malpractices' does not find mention in the provisions under the\n2003 Act but as a term coined by judicial pronouncements.\nThus, the expression 'malpractices' has to be construed in its\nproper perspective and normally may not amount to theft of B\nelectricity as contemplated under Section 135 of the 2003 Act.\nSuch acts/malpractices would fall within the mischief of\nunauthorized use of electricity as stipulated under Section 126\nof the 2003 Act. Cases of pilferage of electricity by adopting\nmalpractices which patently may not be a theft would be the\ncases that would fall within the jurisdiction of the Board in\nfurtherance to the terms and conditions of supply. Reference\nin this regard can be made to the judgment of this Court in the\ncase of Hyderabad Vanaspathi Lts. v. A.P. State Electricity\nBoard \u0026 Anr. [(1998) 4 SCC 471].\nC\nD\nE\nF\n49. There is another angle from which the present case\ncan be examined and obviously without prejudice to the other\ncontentions raised. It is a case where, upon inspection, the\nofficers of the appellant found that respondent was consuming\n142 KVA of electricity which was in excess of the sanctioned\nload. To the inspection report, the respondent had not filed any\nobjection before the competent authority as contemplated under\nSection 126(3) and had approached the High Court. Limited\nfor the purposes of these proceedings, excess consumption is\nnot really in dispute. As stated above, the contentions raised\nby the respondent were to challenge the very jurisdiction of the\nconcerned authorities. Consumption in excess of sanctioned\nload is violative of the terms and conditions of the agreement\nas well as of the statutory benefits. Under Explanation (b)(iv),\n'unauthorised use of electricity' means if the electricity was used G\nfor a purpose other than for which the usage of electricity was\nauthorised. Explanation (b)(iv), thus, would also cover the cases\nwhere electricity is being consumed in excess of sanctioned\nload, particularly when it amounts to change of category and\ntariff. As is clear from the agreement deed, the electric\nH\nC\nD\n272 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2011] 15 (ADDL.) S.C.R.\nA connection was given to the respondent on a contractual\nstipulation that he would consume the electricity in excess of\n22 KVA but not more than 110 KVA. The use of the negative\nlanguage in the condition itself declares the intent of the parties\nthat there was an implied prohibition in consuming electricity\nB in excess of the maximum load as it would per se be also\nprejudiced. Not only this, the language of Regulations 82 and\n106 also prescribe that the consumer is not expected to make\nuse of power in excess of approved contract demand otherwise\nit would be change of user falling within the ambit of\n'unauthorised use of electricity'. Again, there is no occasion for\nthis Court to give a restricted meaning to the language of\nExplanation (b)(iv) of Section 126. According to the learned\ncounsel appearing for the respondent, it is only the actual\nchange in purpose of use of electricity and not change of\ncategory that would attract the provisions of Section 126 of the\n2003 Act. The contention is that where the electricity was\nprovided for a domestic purpose and is used for industrial\npurpose or commercial purpose, then alone it will amount to\nchange of user or purpose. The cases of excess load would\nnot fall in this category. This argument is again without any\nsubstance and, in fact, needs to be noticed only to be rejected.\nWe have already discussed in some detail above that the\nexpressions of the Explanation to Section 126 are to be given\na wider and amplified meaning so as to ensure the\nimplementation of the provisions in contradistinction to\ndefeating the very object of the 2003 Act. Without being\ninnovative and while predicating, we only state the principles\nwhich have been authoritatively pronounced by this Court in\ndifferent cases. In the case of Association of Industrial\nElectricity Users v. State of A.P. \u0026 Ors. [(2002) 3 SCC 711],\nG this Court, while expressing that fixation of tariff in electricity or\nallied matters can hardly be a subject matter of judicial review.\nThe courts would not venture to examine the tariff on merit and\nrestrict its power of judicial review only to procedural matters\nthat too where it is ex facie arbitrary. The Court rejecting the\nH contention raised before it that Section 126 of the Andhra\nE\nF\nEXECUTIVE ENGINEER AND ANR. v. SRI\nSEETARAM RICE MILL [SWATANTER KUMAR, J.]\n273\nB\nPradesh Electricity Reforms Act does not envisage A\nclassification of consumers according to the purpose for which\nthe electricity is used and held that the supply of electricity\npermits differentiation according to the consumer's load factor\nor power factor, total consumption of energy during the\nspecified period, the time at which the supply is required and\nthe need for cross-subsidisation or such tariff as is just and\nreasonable and such as to promote economic efficiency in the\nsupply and consumption of electricity. The tariff may also be\nsuch as to satisfy all other relevant provisions of the 2003 Act\nand the relevant conditions of the Agreement. Thus, there is a\ndirect relation between the quantum of electricity demanded,\nsupplied and tariff rate. The purpose, therefore. would include\nby necessary implication, the category under which the\nelectricity supply is being provided by the licensee to the\nconsumer. Still, in another case of Punjab State Electricity\nBoard v. Vishwa Caliber Builders Private Ltd. [(2010) 4 SCC\n539], this Court was primarily concerned with the question\nwhether the ombudsman would have the jurisdiction to issue\ndirections for regularization of unauthorized electricity.\nAnswering the same in the negative and dealing with the\nquestion of excess load, this Court held as under:\n\"The fact that the appellant could not release connection\nwith a load of 2548 KW on account of non-availability of\ntransformer necessary for transfer of 8 MVA load from 66\nKV sub station, G.T. Road, Ludhiana had no bearing on\nthe issue of consumption of electricity by the respondent\nbeyond the sanctioned load. Undisputedly, in terms of the\nrequest made by the respondent, the Chief Engineer had\nsanctioned connection on the existing system with a load\nof 1500 KW, but the respondent used excess load to the\ntune of 481.637 KW and this amounted to unauthorized\nuse of electrical energy.\"\n50. The consistent view of this Court would support the\nproposition that the cases of excess load of consumption would\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n274 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2011] 15 (ADDL.) S.C.R.\nA be squarely covered under Explanation (b)(iv) of Section 126\nof the 2003 Act. Once this factor is established, then the\nassessing officer has to pass the final order of assessment in\nterms of Sections 126(3) to 126(6) of the 2003 Act.\nB\nD\nE\nDiscussion on Question No.2 and 3\n51. Under the procedure prescribed, the person (the\nconsumer) has to be served with the notice inviting him to file\nobjections, if any, within the stipulated time in terms of Section\n126(3) and the assessing officer is required to pass a final\nC order within 30 days from the date of service of such order of\nprovisional assessment. If the consumer does not pay the\nprovisional assessment amount, as required under Section\n126(4) and file objections under Section 126(3), then after\naffording opportunity to the consumer, the assessing officer\nshall assess the amount and pass an order of final assessment,\nas stated in Section 126(5). Section 126(6) contemplates that\nthe assessment under the Section shall be made at a rate equal\nto twice the tariff applicable for the relevant category of services\nspecified in Sub-section (5). The reference to the category in\nSection 126(6) fully substantiate the view that we have taken\nthat change of category by consumption of excess load will\nautomatically bring the defaulter within the mischief of\nExplanation to Section 126(6). Once the order of assessment\nis finally passed and is served upon the consumer, he is\nexpected to pay the said charges unless, being aggrieved from\nsuch an order, he prefers an appeal under Section 127 of the\n2003 Act. The appeal under Section 127 would lie only against\nthe final order passed under Section 126 that too within 30 days.\nof the said order. The appeal shall be filed, maintained and\ndealt with in accordance with the procedure specified in Section\n127 of the 2003 Act. A bare reading of the provisions of\nSection 127 shows that it is the final order made under Section\n126 which is appealable under Section 127 of the 2003 Act.\nIn other words, issuance of a notice or a provisional order of\nassessment as may be made by the assessing officer in terms\nF\nG\nH\nEXECUTIVE ENGINEER AND ANR. v. SRI\nSEETARAM RICE MILL [SWATANTER KUMAR, J.]\n275\nof sub-section (1) to sub-section (3) of Section 126 of the 2003 A\nAct would not be the order against which an appeal would lie.\n52. It may be noticed that admittedly the present\nrespondent had not preferred any appeal against the\nprovisional order of assessment dated 25th July, 2009 and, in\nB\nfact, had preferred a writ petition against the very issuance of\na notice issued in terms of Sub-sections (2) and (3) of Section\n126 of the 2003 Act. This brings us to the question as to what\nis the scope of jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution\nof India in face of the provisions of Section 127 of the 2003\nAct.\nC\n53. It is a settled canon of law that the High Court would\nnot normally interfere in exercise of its jurisdiction under Article\n226 of the Constitution of India where statutory alternative\nremedy is available. It is equally settled that this canon of law D\nis not free of exceptions. The courts, including this Court, have\ntaken the view that the statutory remedy, if provided under a\nspecific law, would impliedly oust the jurisdiction of the Civil\nCourts. The High Court in exercise of its extraordinary\njurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India can E\nentertain writ or appropriate proceedings despite availability of\nan alternative remedy. This jurisdiction, the High Court would\nexercise with some circumspection in exceptional cases,\nparticularly, where the cases involve a pure question of law or\nvires of an Act are challenged. This class of cases we are\nmentioning by way of illustration and should not be understood\nto be an exhaustive exposition of law which, in our opinion, is\nneither practical nor possible to state with precision. The\navailability of alternative statutory or other remedy by itself may\nnot operate as an absolute bar for exercise of jurisdiction by\nthe Courts. It will normally depend upon the facts and\ncircumstances of a given case. The further question that would\ninevitably come up for consideration before the Court even in\nsuch cases would be as to what extent the jurisdiction has to\nbe exercised.\nF\nG\nH\nA\nс\nD\n276 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2011] 15 (ADDL.) S.C.R.\n54. Should the Courts determine on merits of the case or\nshould it preferably answer the preliminary issue or jurisdictional\nissue arising in the facts of the case and remit the matter for\nconsideration on merits by the competent authority? Again, it\nis somewhat difficult to state with absolute clarity any principle\nB governing such exercise of jurisdiction. It always will depend\nupon the facts of a given case. We are of the considered view\nthat interest of administration of justice shall be better subserved\nif the cases of the present kind are heard by the courts only\nwhere it involves primary questions of jurisdiction or the matters\nwhich goes to the very root of jurisdiction and where the\nauthorities have acted beyond the provisions of the Act.\nHowever, it should only be for the specialized Tribunal or the\nappellate authorities to examine the merits of assessment or\neven factual matrix of the case. It is argued and to some extent\ncorrectly that the High Court should not decline to exercise its\njurisdiction merely for the reason that there is a statutory\nalternative remedy available even when the case falls in the\nabove-stated class of cases. It is a settled principle that the\nCourts/Tribunal will not exercise jurisdiction in futility. The law\nwill not itself attempt to do an act which would be vain, lex nil\nfrustra facit, nor to enforce one which would be frivolous-lex\nneminem cogit ad vana seu inutilia-the law will not force any\none to do a thing vain and fruitless. In other words, if exercise\nof jurisdiction by the Tribunal ex facie appears to be an exercise\nof jurisdiction in futility for any of the stated reasons, then it will\nbe permissible for the High Court to interfere in exercise of its\njurisdiction. This issue is no longer res integra and has been\nsettled by a catena of judgments of this Court, which we find\nentirely unnecessary to refer to in detail. Suffices it to make a\nreference to the judgment of this Court in the case of Whirlpool\nG Corporation v. Registrar of Trade Marks, Mumbai [(1998) 8\nSCC 1] where this Court was concerned with the powers of the\nRegistrar of Trade Marks and the Tribunal under the Trade and\nMerchandise Marks Act, 1958 and exercise of jurisdiction by\nthe High Court in face of availability of a remedy under the Act.\nH This Court while referring to various judgments of this Court and\nE\nF\nEXECUTIVE ENGINEER AND ANR. v. SRI\nSEETARAM RICE MILL [SWATANTER KUMAR, J.]\n277\nspecifying the cases where the alternative remedy would not A\nbar the exercise of jurisdiction by the Court, held as under: -\n\"14. The power to issue prerogative writs under Article 226\nof the Constitution is plenary in nature and is not limited\nby any other provision of the Constitution This power can\nbe exercised by the High Court not only for issuing writs\nin the nature of Habeas Corpus, Mandamus, prohibition,\nQua Warranto and Certiorari for the enforcement of any\nof the Fundamental Rights contained in Part III of the\nConstitution but also for \"any other purpose\".\nB\nC\n15. Under Article 226 of the Constitution, the High Court,\nhaving regard to the facts of the case, has a discretion to\nentertain or not to entertain a writ petition. But the High\nCourt has imposed upon itself certain restrictions one of\nwhich is that if an effective and efficacious remedy is D\navailable, the High Court would not normally exercise its\njurisdiction. But the alternative remedy has been\nconsistently held by this Court not to operate as a bar in\nat least three contingencies, namely, where the writ petition\nhas been filed for the enforcement of any of the E.\nFundamental Rights or where there has been a violation\nof the principle of natural justice or where the order or\nproceedings are wholly without jurisdiction or the vires of\nan Act is challenged. There is a plethora of case law on\nthis point but to cut down this circle of forensic whirlpool F\nwe would rely on some old decisions of the evolutionary\nera of the constitutional law as they still hold the field.\nXXX\nXXX\nXXX\n19. Another Constitution Bench decision in Calcutta G\nDiscount Co. Ltd. v. ITO Companies Distt: [1961] 41 ITR\n191 (SC) laid down :\n\"Though the writ of prohibition or certiorari will not\nissue against an executive authority, the High H\nA\nB\nс\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n278 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2011] 15 (ADDL.) S.C.R.\nCourts have power to issue in a fit case an order\nprohibiting an executive authority from acting\nwithout jurisdiction. Where such action of an\nexecutive authority acting without jurisdiction\nsubjects or is likely to subject a person to lengthy\nproceedings and unnecessary harassment, the\nHigh Court will issue appropriate orders or\ndirections to prevent such consequences. Writ of\ncertiorari and prohibition can issue against Income\nTax Officer acting without jurisdiction Under Section\n34 Income Tax Act.\"\n20. Much water has since flown under the bridge, but there\nhas been no corrosive effect on these decisions which\ncommand though old, continue to hold the field with the\nresult that law as to the jurisdiction of the High Court in\nentertaining a writ petition under Article 226 of the\nConstitution, in spite of the alternative statutory remedies,\nis not affected, specially in a case where the authority\nagainst whom the writ is filed is shown to have had no\njurisdiction or had purported to usurp jurisdiction without\nany legal foundation.\n21. That being so, the High Court was not justified in\ndismissing the writ petition at the initial stage without\nexamining the contention that the show cause notice issued\nto the appellant was wholly without jurisdiction and that the\nRegistrar, in the circumstances of the case, was not\njustified in acting as the 'Tribunal'.\"\n55. Even in the case of Union of India v. State of Haryana\n[(2000) 10 SCC 482], this Court took the view that the question\nraised was a legal one which required determination as to\nwhether provision of telephone connections and instruments\namounted to sale and why the Union of India should not be\nexempted from payment of sales tax under the respective\nstatutes. Holding that the question was fundamental in character\nEXECUTIVE ENGINEER AND ANR. v. SRI\nSEETARAM RICE MILL [SWATANTER KUMAR, J.]\n279\nand need not even be put through the mill of statutory appeals A\nin hierarchy, this Court remitted the matter to the High Court\nfor determination of the questions of law involved in that case.\n56. Applying these principles to the facts of the present\ncase, it is obvious that no statutory appeal lay against a\nB\nprovisional order of assessment and the respondents herein\nwere required to file objections as contemplated under Section\n126 (3) of the 2003 Act. It was only when a final order of\nassessment was passed that the respondents could prefer a\nstatutory appeal which admittedly was not done in the case in\nhand.\nC\n57. In the present case, the High Court did not fall in error\nof jurisdiction in entertaining the writ petition but certainly failed\nto finally exercise the jurisdiction within the prescribed\nlimitations of law for exercise of such jurisdiction. Keeping in D\nview the functions and expertise of the specialized body\nconstituted under the Act including the assessing officer, it\nwould have been proper exercise of jurisdiction, if the High\nCourt, upon entertaining and deciding the writ petition on a\njurisdictional issue, would have remanded the matter to the E\ncompetent authority for its adjudication on merits and in\naccordance with law. In the facts of the present case, the High\nCourt should have answered the question of law relating to lack\nof jurisdiction and exercise of jurisdiction in futility without\ntravelling into and determining the validity of the demand which F\nsquarely fell within the domain of the specialized authority. The\nHigh Court should have remanded the case to the assessing\nofficer with a direction to the respondent to file its objections\nincluding non-applicability of the tariff before the assessing\nauthority and for determination in accordance with law.\n58. Having dealt with and answered determinatively the\nquestions framed in the judgment, we consider it necessary to\nprecisely record the conclusions of our judgment which are as\nfollows:-\nG\nH\n280 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2011] 15 (ADDL.)

The cases of excess load\nconsumption than the connected load inter alia\nwould fall under Explanation (b)(iv) to Section 126\nof the 2003 Act, besides it being in violation of\nRegulations 82 and 106 of the Regulations and\nterms of the Agreement.\nIn view of the language of Section 127 of the 2003\nAct, only a final order of assessment passed under\nSection 126(3) is an order appealable under\nSection 127 and a notice-cum-provisional\nassessment made under Section 126(2) is not\nappealable.\nThus, the High Court should normally decline to\ninterfere in a final order of assessment passed by\nthe assessing officer in terms of Section 126(3) of\nthe 2003 Act in exercise of its jurisdiction under\nArticle 226 of the Constitution of India.\nThe High Court did not commit any error of\njurisdiction in entertaining the writ petition against\nthe order raising a jurisdictional challenge to the\nnotice/provisional assessment order dated 25th\nJuly, 2009.
