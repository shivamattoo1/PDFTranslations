Malhotra, Senior Advocate,\nAmicus Curiae submitted that for just compensation the\nmultiplier should be enhanced to 24-25 years. Further,\naccording to him, while calculating the compensation, the\namount payable towards dependency should be increased as\nB\nthe life expectancy is upto 70-75 years and secondly after 10\nyears of earning capacity it should be doubled in view of\nescalation of cost of living and progressive increase in the\nincome.\n52. Keeping in view the cost of living, the Central\nGovernment is required to amend the Second Schedule [See\nSection 163A (3)]. The Second Schedule was enacted by Act\n54 of 1994 w.e.f. 14th November, 1994. Now more than 19\nyears have passed but no amendment has been made. Cost\nof living has gone up many fold.\nC\n53. In view of finding recorded above, we hold that Second D\nSchedule as was enacted in 1994 has now become redundant,\nirrational and unworkable, due to changed scenario including\nthe present cost of living and current rate of inflation and\nincreased life expectancy.\n54. A letter dated 5th December, 2012 issued by the Joint E\nSecretary, Ministry of Road Transport \u0026 Highways, New Delhi\nhas been brought to our notice by Mr. P.P. Malhotra. Giving\nreference to the present case therein, the officer has informed\nthat the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Bill, 2012, inter alia, to\namend Section 163A of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 was F\npassed by the Rajya Sabha on 8th May, 2012. The said Bill\nproposes to substitute Section 163-A(3) of the Act by\nempowering the Central Government to revise the amount or\nthe multiplier specified in the Second Schedule after every three\nyears and furthermore, the Bill also seeks to substitute the\nSecond Schedule so as to provide that for death of non-earning G\npersons, a fixed compensation of Rs.1,00,000 for children up\nto 5 years of age and Rs.1,50,000/- for persons more than 5\nyears of age. It is informed that though the Bill has been passed\nby the Rajya Sabha and it is still pending consideration before\nthe Lok Sabha for its approval.

In this connection, I am to inform that the Motor\nVehicles (Amendment) Bill, 2012, inter alia, to amend\nSection 163A of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, was passed\nby Rajya Sabha on 8.5.2012. The said Bill proposes to\nsubstitute Section 163A(3) of the Act by the following\nsection:\n\"The Central Government keeping in view the cost of\nliving and the rise in the price index, may, by notification\nin the Official Gazette, revise the amount or the multiplier\nspecified in the Second Schedule after every three\nyears.\n2.1. Furthermore, the Bill also seeks to substitute the\nSecond Schedule so as to provide that for death of non-\nearning persons, a fixed compensation shall be payable\nas under:-\n(i) Rs.1,00,000 for children up to 5 years of age\n(ii) Rs.1,50,000/- for persons more than 5 years of age.\nThe minimum amount payable is sought to be revised\nto Rs.1,00,000.\n2.2. The following steps have been proposed for working\nout compensation:-\n(a) The proven annual income of the victim is to be\nworked out:\nPUTTAMMA \u0026 ORS. v. K. L. NARAYANA REDDY \u0026 889\nANR. [SUDHANSU JYOTI MUKHOPADHAYA, J.]\n(b) Appropriate multiplier (higher of the multiplier based A\non the age of the victim and the age of the surviving/\ndependent parents/spouse/children) to be applied:\n(c) Multiply the proven annual income by the appropriate\nmultiplier to arrive at compensation amount, subject to\nfollowing, namely:-\nB\n(i) The amount of compensation payable for Permanent\nTotal Disablement as defined in Schedule 1 of the\nWorkmen's Compensation Act, 1923 (8 of 1923) shall be\ndetermined by application of appropriate multiplier to\nproved income, subject to maximum of Rs.10 lakhs.\n(ii) The amount of compensation so arrived shall be\nreduced by 1/3rd in respect of fatal accidents (reduction\nof 1/3rd represents living expenses for deceased person,\nhad he been alive)\n2.4. The Bill is presently pending in Lok Sabha.\n3. You are requested to place the above facts before the\nHon'ble Supreme Court of India. Further development in\nthis matter may please be intimated to this Ministry.\nC\nD\nE\nShri P.P. Malhotra,\nYours sincerely,\ni\n(Sanjay Bandopadhyaya)\nAdditional Solicitor General of India,\nSupreme Court of India,\n57 Lodhi Estate,\nNew Delhi - 110003.\"\n55. From the proposed Bill we find that there is a proposal\nto change the multiplier applicable for different age groups; it\ndoes not contemplate schedule structure of compensation. The\nfactors to be considered for working out compensation are (a)\nage of the victim (b) multiplier (c) annual income up to\nRs.1,00,000/- (the maximum annual income for calculation of\ncompensation will be deemed to be Rs.1,00,000/-even if the\nF\nG\nH\n890 SUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2013] 16 S.C.R.\nA income exceeds Rs.1,00,000/-). Separate provisions have\nbeen made for grievous injury and non-grievous injury etc.\nC\n56. The Central Government was bestowed with duties to\namend the Second Schedule in view of Section 163-A(3), but\nit failed to do so for 19 years in spite of repeated observations\nB of this Court. For the reasons recorded above, we deem it\nproper to issue specific direction to the Central Government\nthrough the Secretary, Ministry of Road Transport \u0026 Highways\nto make the proper amendments to the Second Schedule table.\nkeeping in view the present cost of living, subject to amendment\nof Second Schedule as proposed or may be made by the\nParliament. Accordingly, we direct the Central Government to\ndo so immediately. Till such amendment is made by the Central\nGovernment in exercise of power vested under sub-section (3)\nof Section 163A of Act, 1988 or amendment is made by the\nParliament, we hold and direct that for children upto the age of\nD 5 years shall be entitled for fixed compensation of Rs.1,00,000/\n-(rupees one lakh) and persons more than 5 years of age shall\nbe entitled for fixed compensation of Rs.1,50,000/-(rupees one\nlakh and fifty thousand) or the amount may be determined in\nterms of Second Schedule whichever is higher. Such amount\nis to be paid if any application is filed under Section 163A of\nE\nthe Act, 1988.\nF\nG\nGrant of Interest\n57. Section 171 of the Act, 1988 deals with the award of\ninterest where any claim is allowed, it reads as follows:\n\"171. Award of interest where any claim is allowed.-\nWhere any Claims Tribunal allows a claim for\ncompensation made under this Act, such Tribunal may\ndirect that in addition to the amount of compensation\nsimple interest shall also be paid at such rate and from\nsuch date not earlier than the date of making the claim\nas it may specify in this behalf.\"\nUnder the said provision no rate of interest has been fixed\nand its duty is bestowed upon the Tribunal to fix the rate of\ninterest.\nH\n"}
