According\nto the prosecution, appellant-accused was the son of PW-3. PW-4 and the\ndeceased were his step-brothers and PW-6 was his step-sister. PWs-1, 2, 3\nand the appellant were talking about partition of the property of PW-3.\nAppellant wanted half share of the property while PW-3 was ready to give\nonly one-third share to him. At this, appellant, with an axe went to the deceased\n(who was taking bath) and assaulted him by giving two to three blows with the\naxe. On his threat, PWs 1, 2 and 3 entered their respective houses. PW-6,\nG hearing the alarm went to the deceased. She also alarmed PW-4 not to come\nout of the house. Appellant with his axe went to the Police Station and made\na statement to the Officer-in-charge that the deceased had been killed by that\naxe. On the basis thereof Officer-in-charge went to the spot and recorded\nstatement of PW-1. On the basis of his statement FIR was recorded.\nH\n660\nSWAMI PRASAD v. STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH\n661\nAt the trial, PWs 1, 2 and 3 turned hostile. Evidence of PW6 was not\ndisbelieved on the premise that she had made improvement upon her statement.\nThe appellant was acquitted. On appeal, High Court, after examining the matter,\nconvicted the appellant.\nA\nIn appeal to this Court, appellant contended that in view of the facts of\nthe case, particularly the fact that Trial Court as well as High Court did not B\nrely upon the testimony of the sole eye-witness (PW-6), High Court had\ncommitted error in reversing the judgment of acquittal.\nDismissing the appeal, the Court\nHELD: 1.1. There are several circumstances which lead to the C\nconclusion that the appellant alone is guilty of commission of murder of the\ndeceased. [Para 17] [666-G]\n1.2. From the evidences on records, apart from PW-6, who is an eye-\nwitness, the following facts must be held to have been sufficiently proved.\nAppellant had demanded 1/2 share in the property from his father; and having D\nbeen told that the property would be divided equally amongst the three sons,\nhe became angry; PW-4 while in his house heard a cry that the deceased had\nbeen killed by the appellant. Appellant was seen at the place of occurrence\nwith an axe. He went to the Police Station with the axe and blood-stained\nclothes. [Para 24] [668-D-F]\n1.3. It is true that three prosecution witnesses were declared hostile,\nbut the same by itself, would not lead to the conclusion that the High Court\ncommitted any error in passing the impugned judgment. It is well settled that\na Court in a given situation even may rely on the statements of the witnesses,\nwho had been permitted to be cross-examined by the prosecution.\n[Para 15] [666-C]\nE\n☐☐\nF\n1.4. Although PW 3 resiled from his statement that he had seen the\nappellant assaulting the deceased, but he had proved the other part of his\nearlier statement, namely, the demand of 1/2 share in the property by the\nappellant and on his refusal to accept the said demand, the appellant went G\ntowards the well with an axe in his hand. The dispute in regard to the share\nin the property has been proved by all the prosecution witnesses, namely, PW-\n1, PW-2 and PW-3. [Paras 17 and 20] [666-G-H; 667-C]\n1.5. It may be true that the evidence of PW-6 had not been believed in\nits entirety by the Trial Judge. Her evidence has, however, been believed at H\nA\n662\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 3 S.C.R.\nleast in part by the High Court. The reason for not believing her evidence is\nsaid to be that in her statement under Section 161 Cr. P.C. before the\nInvestigating Officer, she had not stated to have seen the appellant assaulting\nthe deceased with an axe. Her statement, however, before the police as also\nbefore the trial court should be considered in its entirety. It is not in dispute\nthat at least she had heard a cry that the deceased had been killed by the\nB appellant. She ran to the place of occurrence. She even before going to the\nplace of occurrence asked her brother not to come there. PW-4 in his evidence\nsupported that part of the testimony of PW-6. [Para 16] [666-D-E]\n1.6. Although the appellant did not make any categorical statement that\nhe had killed the deceased, his statement to the effect that the deceased had\nC\nbeen killed with the axe which he had been holding is sufficiently indicative\nof the fact that it was he who had killed the deceased. His statement is to be\nread reasonably and in its entirety. So read no other meaning can be attributed\nthereto. [Para 25] [668-G]\nD\n2. There cannot be any doubt whatsoever, that a judgment of acquittal\nshould not be interfered with, if two views are possible. However, it is equally\ntrue that the High Court while entertaining an appeal against a judgment of\nacquittal would be entitled to consider the entire materials on records for the\npurpose of analyzing the evidence. There is a presumption that an accused is\ninnocent, unless proved otherwise. When he is acquitted, the said\nE presumption, becomes stronger. But it may not be correct to contend that\ndespite overwhelming evidence available on records, the appellate court would\nnot interfere with a judgment of acquittal.

Singh for the Respondent.\nA\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nS.B. SINHA, J. 1. This appeal is directed against a judgment and order\ndated 24.11.1999 passed by a Division Bench of the Madhya Pradesh High\nCourt at Jabalpur in Criminal Appeal No. 762 of 1988 whereby and whereunder B\na judgment of the learned Sessions Judge, Taikamgarh, Madhya Pradesh\ndated 30.12.1987 in Sessions Trial No. 4 of 1987 acquitting the appellant from\nthe charge of commission of an offence punishable under Section 302 of the\nIndian Penal Code, was set aside.\n2. The basic fact of the matter is not in dispute. One Devakinandan C\n(PW-3) is the father of the appellant as also the deceased Rameshwar.\nAppellant herein is his son through his first wife. After the death of his first\nwife, Devakinandan married one Binna. The deceased and Ram Sahay (PW-\n4) were his sons and Ramsri (PW-6) was his daughter through Binna, the\nsecond wife of Devakinandan.\n3. On 08.11.1986 at about 10 a.m. Paras Ram (PW-1) Devakinandan (PW-\n3), Raj Kumar (PW-2) and the appellant were talking beneath a 'neem' tree near\nthe house of PW-3 as regards partition of the lands belonging to him. Appellant\nherein claimed 1/2 share in the property of PW-3. PW-3, however, declined\nto give him 1/2 share stating that he had three sons and all the sons would\nget equal shares.\nD\nE\n4. PW-4 Ram Sahay, (brother of the deceased) and the deceased at that\npoint of time were minors. They were taking bath at a well. PW-4 after taking\nbath left for his house. Appellant, in the meanwhile, went towards the well\nwith an axe in his hand. While the deceased was taking bath, he allegedly F\nassaulted him by giving two or three blows with his axe on his neck saying\nthat 'he had done the division in two parts'. He also gave an exhortation that\nwhoever would come would be killed; upon hearing of which, PW-1, PW-2\nand PW-3 allegedly entered their respective houses. PW-6, Ramshri (sister of\nthe deceased and PW-4), who was standing near her house, heard the alarm\nthat the appellant had killed Rameshwar, came to the spot and found her\nbrother lying in an injured condition. She immediately alarmed her brother\nPW-4 not to come from his house. Appellant from the place of occurrence\nwent to the Police Station, Niwari. He purported to have made a statement\nbefore the officer in charge at the Police Station, disclosing that Rameshwar\nhad been killed with the axe carried by him in his hand. At that point of time,\nG\nH\n664\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 3 S.C.R.\nA one Rajendra Shekhar, who was an advocate as also a journalist was present\nin the Police Station. He examined himself as PW-11.\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n5. On the basis of the said information, the officer in charge of the Police\nStation came to the spot. PW-1 made the following statement before him :\n\"I am doing agriculture in Byavata - Ram Sahai, Rameswar, Swami\nPrasad are sons of my uncle. Swami Prasad was the son of elder wife\nand Rameswar was the son of younger wife. Swami Prasad is in\npossession of half the land. While Devaki Nandan wanted to give\none-third share to Swami. Today at about 10' O' clock in the morning,\nSwami Prasad, Dewaki Nandan, Raj Kumar Yadav and I were sitting\nunder Neem Tree. Swami Prasad said \"I am son of married lady (wife),\ngive me half share of the land\", Dewaki said you are three brothers\".\nTherefore you will get only one third share. At that time, Ram Sahai,\nRameswar were taking bath on the well. After a short time, Ram Sahai\nwent to, Swami Prasad armed with an axe reached the well where\nRameswar was bathing and suddenly make strike with axe two three\ntimes and shouted \"see\", there are two parts. We saw dying Rameswar\nthereafter Swami shouted \"come\" all to be killed. Raj Kumar, Dewaki\nNandan and I ran and entered in the house. Swami Prasad kept on\nwaiting with axe for some time and then moved towards Niwari. Till\nnow, I stayed at the home on account of fear. Having come there, I\nsaw, there were axe injuries on Rameswar's neck and he had died.\nTherefore, I lodge this report. Investigation may be done.,”\n6. A First Information Report was drawn on the basis of the said\nstatement.\n7. At the trial, however, not only PW-1 but also PW-2 and PW-3 turned\nhostile. They resiled from their earlier statements. PW-4 was not an eye-\nwitness. The learned Trial Judge disbelieved the statement of PW-6, inter alia,\non the premise that she had made improvement thereupon. A judgment of\nacquittal, therefore, on the said findings, was passed.\n8. On an appeal made by the State before the High Court against the\nsaid judgment of acquittal, however, a Division Bench of the High Court\nexamined the matter in details and held the appellant guilty of commission of\nmurder of Rameshwar and sentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment\nfor life.\n•\nSWAMI PRASAD v. STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH [S.B. SINHA, J.] 665\n9. Mr. Yashank P. Adhyaru, the learned Senior Counsel appearing on A\nbehalf of the appellant, would submit that having regard to the nature of\nevidences brought on records by the prosecution, the High Court must be\nheld to have committed a manifest error in reversing a judgment of acquittal\nparticularly in view of the fact that both the learned Trial Judge as also the\nHigh Court did not rely upon the testimony of the sole eye-witness PW-6 on\nB\nthe ground that she had not made any statement before the Investigating\nOfficer under Section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 to the effect\nthat she had seen the appellant assaulting the deceased with an axe.\n10. The learned counsel would submit that even the informant PW-1 had\nnot made any statement before the court that he had seen the actual incident, C\nand he merely disclosed that he had heard an alarm and on cross-examination,\nmade a categorical statement that somebody had told him thereabout, but the\nname of the person from whom he had known had not been disclosed.\n11. Our attention has further been drawn to the fact that even PW-2\nrefused to claim himself to be an eye-witness. PW-3, the father of the deceased, D\ncategorically stated that he had not seen the incident. He thus, was a witness\nto the dispute. According to the learned counsel PW-4 was admittedly not\nan eye-witness. Mr. Siddhartha Dave, learned counsel for the State, however,\nsupported the judgment of the High Court.\n12. The death of Rameshwar being homicidal in nature is not in dispute. E\nDr. Vimal Kumar Jain, (PW-5) conducted the post-mortem examination. He\nfound the following external injuries on the person of the deceased:\n\"(1) There was incised wound 5\" x 4\" x 3\" with clear cut margin on\nright back and lateral upper portion of the neck. There was clotted\nblood and main artery was cut.\n(2) There was incised wound 3\" x 2\" x 2\" in the back lower side\nof neck and in lateral portion and the margin of the wound was clearly\ncut. There was clotted blood and blood vein cut.\nF\n(3) There was incised wound with clearly cut margin 3\" x 2\" x 1\" G\nin the right side of back and Scapular region and there was clotted\nblood.\"\n13. Death of Rameshwar, therefore, being homicidal in nature is not in\ndoubt. It is also not in dispute that the incident took place at 10 a.m. on\n08.11.1986. The place of occurrence is also not in dispute. Appellant admittedly H\n666\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 3 S.C.R.\nA came to the Police Station, Niwari at about 11 a.m. He came there with an axe\nin his hand. It was stained with blood. He stated that a murder had been\ncommitted by the axe which he had been holding. The said axe was seized\nby the officer in charge of the Niwari Police Station, Shri N.C. Tiwari.\n14. On the basis of the said information, Shri Tiwari came to the spot\nB and recorded the First Information Report.\nC\nD\n15. It is true that three prosecution witnesses were declared hostile, but\nthe same by itself, in our considered opinion, would not lead to the conclusion\nthat the High Court committed any error in passing the impugned judgment.\nIt is well settled that a Court in a given situation even may rely on the\nstatements of the witnesses, who had been permitted to be cross-examined\nby the prosecution.\n16. It may be true that the evidence of PW-6 had not been believed in\nits entirety by the learned Trial Judge. Her evidence has, however, been\nbelieved at least in part by the High Court. The reason for not believing her\nevidence is said to be that in her statement under Section 161 Cr. P.C. before\nthe Investigating Officer, she had not stated to have seen the appellant\nassaulting the deceased with an axe. Her statement, however, before the\npolice as also before the trial court should be considered in its entirety. It is\nnot in dispute that at least she had heard a cry that Rameshwar had been\nE killed by the appellant. She ran to the place of occurrence. She even before\ngoing to the place of occurrence asked her brother not to come there.\nPW-4 in his evidence supported that part of the testimony of PW-6. He\nstated:\nF\nG\nH\n\"By that time I finished taking bath and then I left for my home\nand at that time still Rameshwar was taking the bath at the well. The\ndistance between my house and the pump is 500 ft. and as soon as\nI sat in my house to take the meal, then my sister Ramshri, who was\noutside, raised the alarm that Swami killed Rameshwar by giving blow\nof the axe and she asked to close the gate and to remain indoor...\"\n17. There are several other circumstances which, in our opinion, lead to\nthe conclusion that the appellant and the appellant alone is guilty of commission\nof murder of Rameshwar. The dispute in regard to the share in the property\nhas been proved by all the prosecution witnesses, namely, PW-1, PW-2 and\nPW-3.\nSWAMI PRASAD 1. STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH [S.B. SINHA, J.] 667\n18. PW-3 is the father of the deceased as also the appellant. He, A\nhowever, resiled from his earlier statement; but he had assigned reasons\ntherefor, stating:\n\"...I think whatever destined has happened and now there should not\nbe bad consequences for the family of Swami.\"\n19. It shows as to why he had turned hostile. It also indicates why PWI\nand PW2 turned hostile. Even PW4 did not tell the whole truth.\nB\n20. Let us now consider as to what extent PW3 can be believed.\nAlthough he resiled from his statement that he had seen the appellant\nassaulting the deceased, but he had proved the other part of his earlier C\nstatement, namely, the demand of 1/2 share in the property by the appellant\nand on his refusal to accept the said demand, the appellant went towards the\nwell with an axe in his hand.\n21. PW-1, the informant, is also a witness to the aforementioned incident.\nHe was present when Appellant made a claim of 1/2 share in the property. He\nwas also seen going towards the well with axe in his hands. According to him\nwhen he reached home, he had heard an alarm that Rameshwar had been\nmurdered. He did not in his cross-examination, dispute his earlier statements.\nHe stated:\nD\nE\n\"It is correct to say that I and Rameshwar used to sit together in\nthe village and even we used to go together in the marriage. Rajkumar\ndoes not belong to my family. Rajkumar got the share and he belongs\nto our family. The First Information Report of the occurrence were\nshown to T.I. I got it mentioned by T.I. in the report Ext. P-1 marked\nas 'A' to 'A' that at that time Ramsahay and Rameshwar were taking F\nbath at the well. Ramsahay left for the home after some time. Thereafter\nSwami Prasad armed with Axe and he reached in the well, where\nRameshwar was taking bath and he immediately gave 2-3 blows of Axe\nat the neck of Rameshwar and he raised the voice telling that see that\nnow there are two shares. I saw Rameshwar while falling. Later Swami\nraised the voice and he invited all persons to come as he wanted to\nkill all. It is correct to say that I did not see Swami Prasad while giving\nblows of axe at Rameshwar. I did not give the attention that whether\nSwami was armed with axe at that time when he left. It is correct to\nsay that I saw Swami while going towards the well. I did not see\nRamsahay and Rameshwar while taking bath. As I heard the alarm, so H\nG\n668\nA\nB\nC\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 3 S.C.R.\nI got it dictated that Swami killed Rameshwar with the axe.\"\n22. Similarly, he furthermore stated:\n\"...It is correct to say that I disclosed in my statement in the portion\n'B to 'B' of Ext. P-4 that after some time Ramsahay left for the home\nand then Swami Prasad suddenly came armed with the axe towards the\nwell. I did not disclose in my statement to the T.I. in the portion 'C'\nto 'C' of Ext. P-4 that Swami Prasad suddenly gave blow of the axe at\nRameshwar and when he gave second blow, then he told that see\nthere are two portions...\"\n23. Even in cross-examination made on behalf of the appellant, he\naccepted that he heard an alarm that Rameshwar was killed and the appellant\nhad killed him.\n24. From the evidences on records, apart from PW-6, who is an eye-\nwitness, in our opinion, the following facts must be held to have been\nD sufficiently proved:\n【1】\nE\nF\n(1) Appellant had demanded 1/2 share in the property from his father\nat about 10 a.m. on 08.11.1986; and having been told that the\nproperty would be divided equally amongst the three sons, he\nbecame angry;\n(2) PW-4 while in his house heard a cry that Rameshwar had been\nkilled by the appellant.\n(3) Appellant was seen at the place of occurrence with an axe.\nHe went to the Police Station with the axe and blood-stained\nclothes;\n25. Although he did not make any categorical statement that he had\nkilled the deceased, his statement to the effect that Rameshwar had been\nkilled with the axe which he had been holding is sufficiently indicative of the\nfact that it was he who had killed the deceased. His statement is to be read\nG reasonably and in its entirety. So read no other meaning can be attributed\nthereto.\n26. There cannot be any doubt whatsoever, that a judgment of acquittal\nshould not be interfered with, if two views are possible. This has recently\nbeen stated in Samghaji Hariba Patil v. State of Karnataka, AIR (2007) SC\nH\n28.\nSWAMI PRASAD v. STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH [S.B. SINHA, J.] 669\nA\n27. However, it is equally true that the High Court while entertaining an\nappeal against a judgment of acquittal would be entitled to consider the entire\nmaterials on records for the purpose of analyzing the evidence. There is a\npresumption that an accused is innocent, unless proved otherwise. When he\nis acquitted, the said presumption, becomes stronger. But it may not be B\ncorrect to contend that despite overwhelming evidence available on records,\nthe appellate court would not interfere with a judgment of acquittal. {See\nChandrappa \u0026 Ors. v. State of Karnataka,, (2007) 3 SCALE 90]}.\n28. For the reasons aforementioned, we do not find any merit in this\nappeal which is dismissed accordingly.\n29. Appellant is on bail. He is directed to surrender forthwith and serve\nout the remaining sentence, failing which, the Chief Judicial Magistrate\nconcerned shall take proper steps for his apprehension.\nK.K.T.\nAppeal dismissed.\nC\n"}
