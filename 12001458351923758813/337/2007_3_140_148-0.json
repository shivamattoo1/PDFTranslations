Both the\nSchemes provided for different nature of incentives 1989 Scheme not given\nretrospective effect and entrepreneurs were given a choice to opt for either\nof the two Schemes. Appellant herein opted for 1989 Scheme. Eligibility\nCertificate was granted in terms whereof 1989 Scheme was applied. In order\nF of assessment exemptions were stated to have been granted in terms of 1987\nScheme. When the mistake of the Assessing Authority was discovered, a show\ncause notice was issued to the appellant for payment of balance sales tax.\nAppellant filed a Writ Petition thereagainst on the grounds that it being\neligible for grant of exemption under both the Schemes, it preferred to avail\nof 100% exemption under 1987 Scheme; that notices seeking recovery of\nthe balance tax was contrary to assessment order; and that respondent having\ngranted exemption under 1987 Scheme, could not be permitted to change its\nopinion to allow exemption under 1989 Scheme.

It may be true that the Assessing Authority committed a\nmistake in referring to the 1987 Scheme in its order of assessment, but\nthereby the appellant cannot be permitted to derive any benefit to which it was\nnot entitled under the law. Appellant indisputably was eligible for grant of\nB\nexemption in terms of both the Schemes. Having opted for the 1989 Scheme,\nnow the appellant cannot be permitted to turn round and contend that it should\nhave been granted the benefit of 1987 Scheme, only because at a later stage\nit found the same to be more beneficial.

Verma and P.K. Manohar for the Appellant.\nSushil Kumar Jain, Puneet Jain, Christe Jain and Abhishek Gupta for the\nRespondent.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nS.B. SINHA, J. 1. Leave granted.\n2. The State of Rajasthan pursuant to its industrial policy formulated\nC 'Sales Tax Incentive Scheme, 1987' (for short, '1987 Scheme') and 'Sales Tax\nNew Incentive Scheme for Industries, 1989' (for short, '1989 Scheme). In terms\nof 1987 Scheme exemption from payment of sales tax of 100% was provided.\n1989 Scheme which was notified in the Official Gazette on or about 06.07.1989\nwas given retrospective operation with effect from 05.03.1987. It was to rernain\nD in force upto 31.03.1998. Sub-clause (b) of Clause (1) of 1989 Scheme reads\nas under :\n(1)\nE\nF\n(b) An industrial Unit, other than the new industrial unit covered by\n1985 Dispensation, being covered by the Sales Tax Incentive Scheme\nfor Industries, 1987 (hereinafter referred to as the Old Incentive Scheme)\nshall have an alternative option to seek the benefits under the New\nIncentive Scheme.\"\n3. Clause 4 of the said Scheme which is relevant for our purpose, reads\nas under:\n\"4. Exemption from tax on sales - (a) An industrial unit, which is\ngranted eligibility certificate under this notification shall be exernpted\nfrom payment of tax on sales made within the State of the goods\nmanufactured by it in accordance with the parameters incorporated in\nAnnexure \"C\" to this notification.\n0\nH\n(b) for the purpose of arriving at the limit of tax exemption as provided\nin Annexure \"C\" the aggregate of the following shall be considered-\n(i) Aggregate amount of tax which would have been leviable under the\nprovisions of the RST Act 1954;\nà½ \nVIVIDH MARBLES PVT. LTD. 1. COMMERCIAL TAX OFFICER [S.B. SINHA, J.]\n143\n(ii) Aggregate amount of tax on inter-State sales which would have A\nbeen leviable under the provisions of the CST Act, 1956; and\n(iii) Aggregate amount of tax, as and when levied, on consignments.\n(d) When the limit of tax exemption prescribed in Annexure \"C\" is\nexhausted, all sales thereafter shall be subject to tax under the Act by\nthe assessing authority concerned.\nB\n(e) The Incentive available under this Scheme shall be subject to the\ncondition that the beneficiary industrial unit after having availed of\nC\nany benefit under this Scheme shall not make sales outside the State\nincluding branch transfers of the goods manufactured by it exceeding\n60% in case of SSI, Medium and Large units and 80% in case of\nPioneering and Prestigious units and 90% in case of Very Prestigious\nUnits of its total production.\nD\n4. Appellant herein was eligible to obtain the benefits of the said\nIndustrial Policy both under 1987 and 1989 Schemes. It, however, opted for\n1989 Scheme, wherefor an application for grant of sanction of eligibility\ncertificate was filed before the Manager, District Industries Centre, Rajsamand\non 01.04.1995. Indisputably, the eligibility certificate was to be granted by the\nIndustries Department of the State. The said certificate was granted on E\n07.12.1996, pursuant whereto exemption from tax liability was limited to 75%.\n5. Contending, however, that it had altered its position on a\nrepresentation made by the State that 1987 Scheme would be applicable in its\ncase, the appellant alleged that it had not realized sales-tax from its customers.\nIn support of the said contention, it inter-alia relied upon an order of sanction F\nof eligibility for grant of exemption/deferment issued by the Member Secretary\nof the Department to the Commercial Taxes Officer, Rajsamand, which is in the\nfollowing terms:\n\"The application has been prima-facie found eligible for the benefit of\nexemption from tax/deferment of tax on the basis of 'A Industrial Unit'/\n' a New Unit covered by 1985 dispensation/a sick Industrial Unit/\nExpansion/ Diversification / under sales tax Incentive/ Deferment\nScheme 1987/1989 under PST and / or C.S.T. Act' on the sale of Marble\nSlabs.\nG\nH\n144\nA\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 3 S.C.R.\nHence a formal eligibility certificate as per law be granted to the said\napplicant. The application filled by the unit was completed in all\nrespect on 6.5.95.\nThe eligible fixed capital Investment as determined by the committee:\nwhich is subject to verification as per law is as follows :-\nB\na.\nCost of land\nb.\nCost of new building\n:\n:\n9.49\nC.\nCost of new plant and\nmachinery or imported second\n:\n57.00\nC\nland machinery\nd.\nD\nE\nf.\nInstallation expenditure capitalized\nfor P \u0026 M\nCapitalized interest during construction\nnot exceeding 5% of the total fixed\ncapital investment\nTechnical know-how fees or drawin\nfees paid Laboratories recognized by\nthe State Govt. or the\nCentral Government\nTotal\n:\n:\n66.49\nF\nG\nH\nA copy of eligibility certificate issued by you may also please be sent\nto this office.\"\n6. Reliance has also been placed on the order of assessment passed by\nthe Assessing Authority of the Commercial Taxes Department, wherein also\nexemption had been stated to have been granted in terms of 1987 Scheme, a\nsample copy whereof reads as under:\n\"5. Sale under Incentive Scheme\nFrom 6.5.95 to 5.5.2003 under the Incentive Scheme, 1987 the\nassessee has already been allowed a heavy tax exemption of\nRs. 3,11,250.00. Eligibility Certificate No. 1/354 has been issued to\nthe assessee.\nà½¡à½²à½à¼\nVIVIDH MARBLES PVT. LTD. v. COMMERCIAL TAX OFFICER [S.B. SINHA, J.]\n145\nUnder the Incentive Scheme, 1987 the assessee has made a sale A\nof marbles slab of Rs. 5,42,063. On this sales tax @ 16 percent\nof Rs. 86,730 is being imposed and being deducted from eligible\namounts received under the Incentive Scheme.\"\n7. The mistake of the Assessing Authority, however, having been\nB\ndiscovered, the appellant was issued with a notice to show cause as to why\nit should not pay the balance sales-tax on 25% of its turnover. A writ petition\nfiled thereagainst by the appellant has been dismissed by reason of the\nimpugned judgment.\n8. Mr. M.L. Verma, the learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of C\nthe appellant, would submit that in view of the representation made by the\nrespondent, pursuant whereto or in furtherance whereof the appellant had not\ncollected any tax from the customers, the impugned order cannot be sustained.\nIn any event, it was urged that no penalty or interest should be levied on the\nsaid amount.\nD\n9. The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent, however,\nsupported the impugned judgment.\n10. It is not in dispute that the State formulated two Schemes; one in\nthe year 1987 and another in 1989. The said Schemes provided for different\nE\nnature of incentives. Although 1989 Scheme was framed during pendency of\n1987 Scheme, as noticed hereinbefore, the same was given a retrospective\noperation in terms whereof the entrepreneurs were given a choice to opt either\nfor 1987 Scheme or 1989 Scheme. Appellant was aware thereabout. It opted\nfor 1989 Scheme. The sanction of eligibility provided that a formal eligibility F\ncertificate as per law would be granted to the appellant. The investment for\ncapital, however, was determined at Rs.66.49 lacs. The said sanction did not\namount to a grant of a certificate. The eligibility certificate, as indicated\nhereinbefore, was granted only on 07.12.1996, in terms whereof clearly 1989\nScheme was applied. It was so explicitly stated in the eligibility certificate also.\nIt\nmay be true that the Assessing Authority committed a mistake in referring\nto the 1987 Scheme in its order of assessment, but thereby the appellant\ncannot be permitted to derive any benefit to which it was not entitled under\nthe law. Appellant indisputably was eligible for grant of exemption in terms\nof both the Schemes. It had opted for the latter Scheme. While doing so, it\nmust have taken into consideration the benefits under both the Schemes H\nG\n146\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 3 S.C.R.\nA separately. Having opted for the 1989 Scheme, in our opinion, now the appellant\ncannot be permitted to turn round and contend that it should have been\ngranted the benefit of 1987 Scheme, only because at a later stage it found the\nsame to be more beneficial.\nB\n11. A contention was raised that the eligibility certificate dated 07.12.1996\nwas communicated on 02.07.2003. No. such contention was raised before the\nHigh Court. Before the High Court, the principal contentions raised on behalf\nof the appellant were: (i) It being eligible for grant of exemption under both\nthe Schemes, it preferred to avail of 100% exemption under 1987 Scheme; (ii)\nNotices seeking recovery of 25% tax liability was contrary to the order of\nC assessment; and (iii) Respondent cannot now be permitted to change its\nopinion to allow only 75% exemption under 1989 Scheme, because for all\npractical purposes it had availed and had been granted exemption under 1987\nD\nE\nScheme.\n12. There had been no representation whatsoever on behalf of the\nrespondent that the appellant would be entitled to exemption under 1987\nScheme. The eligibility certificate was to be granted and in fact granted by\nthe Industries Department. The Sales Tax Authorities, therefore, were merely\nto pass an order of assessment on the basis thereof.\n13. The order of sanction being in a printed proforma referred to both\nthe 1987 and 1989 Schemes. It was issued only for the purpose of determination\nof the fixed capital investment. It had nothing to do with the grant of eligibility\ncertificate. If the Assessing Authority committed a mistake in referring to 1987\nScheme and allowed 100% exemption in terms thereof, the State cannot suffer\nF thereby. The statutory authorities are entitled to rectify their mistake. When\nsuch mistakes are apparent on the face of the records even no opportunity\nof hearing is necessary., [See Maharashtra State Seeds Corporation Ltd. v.\nHariprasad Drupadrao Jhadao \u0026 Anr., [2006] 3 SCC 690]\n14. Appellant having opted for grant exemption under 1989 Scheme, the\nG respondent was bound to accept the same and, thus, it had not committed\nany illegality in doing so. In that view of the matter, in our considered view,\nthe appellant who is estopped and precluded from raising a contention contrary\nto or inconsistent with its assertion for grant of exemption.\nH\n15. Reliance has been placed by Mr. Verma on Indian Cement and Ors.\ni\nVIVIDH MARBLES PVT. LTD. v. COMMERCIAL TAX OFFICER [S.B. SINHA, J.} 147\nv. State of Andhra Pradesh and Ors., [1988] 1 SCC 743, West Bengal Hosiery A\nAssociation and Ors. v. State of Bihar and Anr., [1988] 4 SCC 134 and British\nPhysical Lab India Ltd. v. State of Karnataka and Anr., [1999] 1 SCC 170.\n16. In West Bengal Hosiery Association (supra), the question which\narose for consideration was as to whether the levy of sales-tax on goods\nB\nimported into one State from another may affect the free flow of trade and\ncommerce and, thus, attract Article 301 of the Constitution of India. Such a\nquestion does not arise herein.\n17. In Indian Cement (supra) preference to local manufacturers was held\nto be ultra vires Part XIII of the Constitution of India.\n18. In British Physical Lab India Ltd. (supra), it was opined that it was\njust and equitable not to permit the State to collect the differential amount.\nThe said decision again has no application in the instant case.\nC\n19. Mr. Verma then submitted that at least a direction should be issued D\nthat the appellant is not liable to pay any interest or any penalty. We do not\nsee as to how in a case of this nature such a direction can be issued.\nAppellant herein knew the actual state of affairs. It at all material times was\naware of the extent of its entitlement thereto, which was confined to the\nbenefits under the 1989 Scheme. However, despite such knowledge if it had\nnot recovered any tax, it must thank itself therefor.\nE\n20. Furthermore, the question as to whether the appellant did show it\nbona fide or not is a question of fact. Such a contention can be raised only\nin an appropriate proceeding and not before us for the first time. Reliance\nplaced on Shree Cement Ltd. and Anr. v. State of Rajasthan and Ors., [2000] F\n1 SCC 765 is misplaced. Therein, again dicta in Indian Cement (supra) and\nShree Digvijay Cement Co. Ltd. and Ors. v. State of Rajasthan and Ors.,\n[2000] 1 SCC 688 was followed. In this case, there is no direction to the\nrespondent-State to recover the difference in tax.\n21. In State of Rajasthan and Anr. v. J.K. Udiapur Udyog Ltd. and Anr.,\n[2004] 7 SCC 673, whereupon again strong reliance has been placed, the Court\nheld that no penalty or interest should be charged, as the said proceeding\nhad been remained pending. Such a direction was issued by this Court in\nexercise of its jurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution of India,\nhaving regard to the fact that the lis was finally determined by this Court. The\nG\nH\n148\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 3 S.C.R.\nA fact of the present case, in our opinion, is completely different, as applicability\nof the Schemes in question depended upon the volition of the appellant,\nwherewith the respondent had nothing to do.\nB\n22. For the reasons aforementioned, there is no merit in this appeal,\nwhich is dismissed accordingly, with costs. Counsel's fee is assessed at\nRs.10,000/- (Rupees ten thousand only).\nK.K.T.\nAppeal dismissed.\n"}
