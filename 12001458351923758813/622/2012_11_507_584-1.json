This Court holds that the situation has now come\nwhere the position has to be made loud and clear to state\nthat the 1976 Act would govern only such of those lands\nwhich would fall within its area of operation within urban\nagglomeration to the specific exclusion of the agricultural D\nlands and consequently the continued application of the\nun-amended Act of 1960 would remain without any\nrestriction. In Thumati Venkaiah's case this Court made\nit clear that Parliament enacted the Central Act with a view\nto impose ceiling on vacant land other than the land\nmainly used for the purpose of agriculture in an urban\nagglomeration.

In the instant case, since as per the un-amended\nAct of 1960, 'bid land' held by the respondent fell within\nthe definition of 'agriculture' u/s 2(1) and consequent\ndefinition of 'land' in s. 2(17) thereof, the determination of\nholding of such excess agricultural land under the said\nAct of 1960 prior to the coming into force of the Act, 1976\nshould be operated upon.

The Amendment Act of 1974, which was notified\nE\nF\nG\nH\n518 SUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2012] 11 S.C.R.\nA as from 01.04.1976, does not in any way affect the\napplication of 1960 Act as it originally stood. From the\ndefinition of 'agriculture' u/s. 2(1), the definition of\n'agriculturist' u/s. 2(3) along with the expressions ‘a\nperson who cultivates land personally' and the definition\nB of 'land' u/s. 2(17) of the unamended Act of 1960, it is\nevident that the legislature intended and did include\n'lands' held by 'agriculturist' where grass is raised or\nused for grazing purposes as part of agricultural land\nwhich was in the possession of agriculturist. Such lands\nC where grass is grown or used for grazing purpose are\nalways known as 'bid land'. Such ‘bid land' was\nultimately brought within the definition of ‘land' u/s. 2(17)\nof the Act of 1960. Therefore, even by keeping aside the\nimplication of the wider definition which was introduced\nby the Amendment Act of 1974 in regard to ‘bid lands' and\ngoing by the definition of ‘agriculture' and 'land' u/ss. 2(1)\nand 2(17) of the Act of 1960, there is no difficulty in\ncoming to a definite conclusion that such definition\ncontained in the Act as it originally stood did include 'bid\nlands' which lands were exclusively meant for cutting\ngrass for cattle or used for grazing purposes. Therefore,\nthere was no necessity for this Court to draw any further\nassistance either from the Objects and Reasons or from\nthe provisions of the Amendment Act of 1974 in order to\nhold that 'bid lands' were part of agricultural land\ngoverned by the provisions of the Act of 1960.

The decision in Nagbhai Najbhai Khackar is clear\nto the pointer that irrespective of the definition of 'bid\nland' under the Amendment Act 1974, having regard to\nthe definition of ‘bid land' under Act III of 1952, such land\nwould fall within the expression of 'agricultural land' as\nSTATE OF GUJARAT·v. MANOHARSINHJI PRADYUMANSINHJI 519\nJADEJA\ndefined in s. 2(1) of the Act of 1960. The decision in A\nNagbhai Najbhai Khackar is for the simple proposition as\nto how a land where grass is raised or used for grazing\npurposes is to be included under the definition of\n'agriculture' and consequently within the definition of\n'land' as provided u/ss. 2(1) and 2(17) of the Act of 1960.

Aggrieved by the order of the Gujarat Revenue Tribunal,\nthe respondent preferred the writ petition in Special Civil\nApplication No.401a 5 of 1990. Before the learned Single\nE Judge, the respondent took the stand that his lands were\ncovered by the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976\n(hereinafter called the 'Act, 1976') and was not governed by the\nAct of 1960. In fact, the said stand of the respondent was raised\nfor the first time in the writ petition.

MANOHARSINHJI PRADYUMANSINHJI 523\nJADEJA [FAKKIR MOHAMED IBRAHIM KALIFULLA, J.]\n6. We heard Mr. Soli J. Sorabjee, learned senior counsel A\nfor the appellants and Mr. Shekhar Naphade, learned senior\ncounsel for the respondent. Mr. Soli J. Sorabjee, learned senior\ncounsel for the appellants in the first instance traced the\nexistence of the Act of 1960 as it originally stood which was\nenforced on 15.06.1961 and, thereafter, the initiative taken by B\nthe Gujarat State Legislative Assembly by passing a resolution\non 14.08.1972 under Article 252 (1) of the Constitution of India\nauthorizing the Parliament to legislate with respect to\n'imposition of ceiling on the holding of urban immovable\nproperty'. Learned senior counsel also referred to the\namendment passed by the State Legislature to the definition\nof 'land' in the Act of 1960 by way of 'removal of doubts' to the\nexpression 'Bid lands' also to be included in the definition of\n'land' on 23.02.1974 which amendment was notified on\n01.04.1976 under the Gujarat Agricultural Lands Ceiling\n(Amendment) Act, 1972. Learned senior counsel also brought\nto our notice the coming into force of the Act, 1976 on and from\n17.02.1976.\nC\nD\n7. While elaborating his submissions on the various\nprovisions contained in the different enactments, in the E\nforemost, the learned senior counsel referred to the expressions\n'agriculture' under Section 2(1) and 'land' under Section 2(17)\nof the un-amended, Act of 1960. Learned counsel also referred\nto Section 6 which sought to fix the ceiling on holding of such\nagricultural land. In that context, learned senior counsel brought F\nto our notice the Statement of Objects and Reasons for bringing\nout the Gujarat Agricultural Lands Ceiling (Amendment) Act,\n1972 (being Gujarat Act No.2 of 1974) (hereinafter called the\nAmendment Act, 1974) wherein, inter alia, it sought to remove\ndoubts relating to 'Bid lands' of former Princes, as well as, G\nGirasdars and Barkhalidars in the Saurashtra area which were\nduly covered under the definition of 'land' and submitted that it\nwas only with a view to remove doubts that the Amendment Act\nwas brought out and that it was not by virtue of the said\namendment alone 'Bid lands' fell within the definition of 'land'.\nH\nA\n524\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2012] 11 S.C.R.\n8. In other words, according to learned senior counsel,\neven as per the definition of 'land' under Section 2(17) read\nalong with the definition of \"agriculture\" under Section 2(1) of\nthe un-amended Act of 1960, 'Bid lands' were duly covered\nwithin the said expression of 'land' and the Amendment Act,\nB 1974 only sought to remove any doubt in the mind of anyone\nas regards the character of the 'Bid lands'.\nC\nD\n9. The learned senior counsel then referred to Section 2(q),\nnamely, the definition of 'vacant land' and Section 2(o), the\ndefinition of 'urban land' under the provisions of the Act, 1976\nto contend that even going by the said definitions, such land\nwithin the urban agglomeration which fall within the definition\nof 'agricultural land' stood excluded for the purpose of\napplication of the Act, 1976.\n10. Learned senior counsel also brought to our notice the\ndefinition of 'Bid land' under Section 2(a) of the Saurashtra\nEstates Acquisition Act, 1952 (hereinafter called as the\n\"Saurashtra Act No. Ill of 1952\") as well as the definition of the\nvery same expression, namely, 'Bid land' under the Saurashtra\nE Land Reforms Act, 1951 (hereinafter called as the \"Saurashtra\nAct No.XXV of 1951) as well as Saurashtra Barkhali Abolition\nAct (hereinafter called as the \"Saurashtra Act No.XXVI of 1951)\nand contended that even long prior to the Amendment Act 1974\n'Bid land' has been defined to mean a land used by Girasdars\nor Barkhalidars for grazing cattle or for cutting grass, for the\nuse of cattle, meaning thereby that such lands were nonetheless\n'agricultural lands'. In the light of the above statutory provisions\nrelating to the 'Bid land' learned counsel submitted that de hors\nthe Amendment Act 1974 which came to be notified on\n01.04.1976 'Bid land' fell within the definition of 'land' under the\nAct of 1960 and consequently there was no scope for the\nrespondent to fall back upon the Act, 1976 in order to challenge\nthe order passed by the second appellant which ultimately came\nto be confirmed by the Gujarat Revenue Tribunal which was set\naside by the judgment of the Division Bench in the order\nimpugned in this appeal.\nF\nG\nH\nSTATE OF GUJARAT v. MANOHARSINHJI PRADYUMANSINHJI 525\nJADEJA [FAKKIR MOHAMED IBRAHIM KALIFULLA, J.]\n11. The learned senior counsel further contended that this A\nvery issue was considered by this Court in a recent decision\nin Nagbhai Najbhai Khackar Vs. State of Gujarat reported in\n(2010) 10 SCC 594 which has taken the view that the definition\nof 'land' under Section 2(17) read along with Section 2(1) of\nthe Act of 1960 'Bid land' would fall within the definition of B\n'agriculture' and consequently governed by the definition\nSection 2(17) which define the expression 'land' and, therefore,\nthe ceiling limit prescribed under Section 6 of Act of 1960\nwould be applicable to the 'Bid lands' of the respondent. The\nlearned senior counsel also relied upon the decision of the C\nPrivy Council in London Jewellers Limited Vs. Attenborough -\n(1934) 2 K.B. 206; the House of Lords decision in Jacobs Vs.\nLondon County Council - (1950) 1 All E.R. 737; and the Queens\nBench decision in Behrens and another Vs. Bertram Mills\nCircus Ltd. (1957) 1 All E.R. 583 for the proposition that\nwherein a decision more than one reason is assigned to\nsupport the ultimate conclusion, both the reasons will have\nbinding effect and that one cannot be excluded under any\npretext. The learned senior counsel also relied upon Smt.\nSomawanti and others Vs. State of Punjab and others - AIR\n1963 SC 151 wherein it was held that the binding effect of a\ndecision does not depend upon whether a particular argument\nwas considered therein or not, provided that the point with\nreference to which an argument was subsequently advanced\nwas actually decided. The learned senior counsel, therefore,\ncontended that in the recent judgment of this Court in Nagbhai\nNajbhai Khackar (supra) when the ultimate decision was\nreached based on two grounds, both the grounds, would be the\nratio of the decision and, therefore, the said decision will be\ncomplete answer to the question involved in this appeal.\n-\nD\nE\nF\nG\n12. In the alternate learned senior counsel submitted that\nthe argument of the respondent which weighed with the learned\nSingle Judge as well as the Division Bench of the High Court\nin the impugned judgment based on the Act, 1976 vis-à-vis the\nAct of 1960 read along with Amendment Act 1974 was not H\n076 SUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2012] 11 S.C.R.\nMustainable. According to learned senior counsel, in the first\nface, there could not be any repugnancy as between the Act\nof 1960 and the Act, 1976, inasmuch as the amendment of the\ndefinition of 'land' in the Act of 1960 was amended as early as\nin 23.02.1974, namely, long prior to the coming into force of\nthe Act, 1976. According to learned senior counsel the relevant\nlate is the date when the Amendment Act came to be passed\nIn the Assembly on 23.02.1974 and the subsequent notification\ndated 01.04.1976 bringing into effect the Amendment Act 1974\nwas not the relevant date. In other words, according to him,\nthen once the amending legislation was passed in the\nAssembly in the year 1974 the subsequent notification though\nwas made in the year 1976 for bringing into force the\namendments, the relevant date would be the date when the Act\nas passed and not the date when it was notified. The learned\nounsel then contended that in any case the resolution dated\n14.08.1972 was passed under Article 252(1) of the\nConstitution relating to the legislation with respect to ceiling on\nurban immovable property' and it had nothing to do with the\n'agricultural land'. The learned counsel, therefore, contended\nthat the conclusion of the learned Single Judge, as well as, that\nof the Division Bench in having non-suited the appellants on the\nspecific ground that by virtue of the provisions of the Act, 1976\nthe appellants' action in proceeding against the respondent\nunder the Act of 1960 was null and void was unsustainable in\nlaw. Learned senior counsel contended that once the Act, 1976\nstood repealed, as a corollary, the Act of 1960 with all the\nAmendments carried to it would automatically get revived and\nit will not become a dead letter as contended on behalf of the\nrespondent. Learned senior counsel referred to the decision of\nthis Court in M.P.V. Sundararamier \u0026 Co. Vs. The State of\nAndhra Pradesh \u0026 another - 1958 SCR 1422 in support of the\nsaid submission. Learned senior counsel also relied upon\nThumati Venkaiah and others Vs. State of Andhra Pradesh\nand others - (1980) 4 SCC 295 for the said proposition. The\nlearned counsel, therefore, contended that, in the light of the\nrecent decision of this Court in Nagbhai Najbhai Khackar\n"}
