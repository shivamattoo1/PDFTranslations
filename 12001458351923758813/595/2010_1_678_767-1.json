Gupta for the Respondent.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nDALVEER BHANDARI, J. 1. These appeals have been\nfiled by the State of Uttaranchal (now Uttarakhand) against the\norders dated 12.7.2001 and 1.8.2001 passed by the Division\nBench of the High Court of Uttaranchal at Nainital in Civil\nMiscellaneous Writ Petition No. 689 (M/B) of 2001.\n2. The appointment of L. P. Nathani was challenged before\nthe High Court in a Public Interest Litigation on the ground that\nhe could not hold the august Office of the Advocate General of\nUttarakhand in view of Article 165 read with Article 217 of the\nConstitution. According to the respondent, Mr. Nathani was\nineligible to be appointed as the Advocate General because\nhe had attained the age of 62 years much before he was\nappointed as the Advocate General. The High Court entertained\nthe petition and directed the State Government to take decision\nHI\nSTATE OF UTTARANCHAL v. BALWANT SINGH\nCHAUFAL \u0026 ORS. [DALVEER BHANDARI, J.]\n697\non the issue raised within 15 days and apprise the same to the A\nHigh Court.\n3. The State of Uttaranchal preferred special leave\npetitions before this Court on 6.8.2001. This Court vide order\ndated 9.8.2001 stayed the operation of the impugned judgment B\nof the High Court. Thereafter on 11.2.2002, this Court granted\nleave and directed that the stay already granted shall continue.\n4. It may be pertinent to mention that, despite the service\nof notice, the respondents who had initially filed the writ petition\nbefore the High Court challenging the appointment of Nathani\nas the Advocate General did not appear before this Court. This\nclearly demonstrates the non-seriousness and non-commitment\nof the respondents in filing the petition.\nC\n5. Before we proceed to examine the controversy involved D\nin this case, we deem it appropriate to set out Articles 165 and\n217 of the Constitution dealing with the post of the Advocate\nGeneral and the qualifications for appointment to this post in\nthe Constitution. Article 165 which deals with the appointment\nof the Advocate General for the States is reproduced as under: E\n\"165. The Advocate-General for the State.-(1) The\nGovernor of each State shall appoint a person who is\nqualified to be appointed a Judge of a High Court to be\nAdvocate-General for the State.\nF\n(2) It shall be the duty of the Advocate-General to give\nadvice to the Government of the State upon such legal\nmatters, and to perform such other duties of a legal\ncharacter, as may from time to time be referred or\nassigned to him by the Governor, and to discharge the G\nfunctions conferred on him by or under this Constitution or\nany other law for the time being in force.\n(3) The Advocate-General shall hold office during the\npleasure of the Governor, and shall receive such\nremuneration as the Governor may determine.\nH\n"}
