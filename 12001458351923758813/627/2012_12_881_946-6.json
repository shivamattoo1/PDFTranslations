If intention is\nproved and death is caused, then it would amount to culpable\nhomicide.\n34. It is to be noted that in Alister Anthony Pareira's case,\nthe earlier two judgments of this Court reported in (1976) 1 SCC\n889 State of Gujarat Vs. Haiderali Kalubhai, and 2008 (1) SCC\n791 Naresh Giri Vs. State of M.P., both rendered by bench of\ntwo learned Judges of this Court, were neither cited nor have\nbeen referred to. Thus, the ratio decidendi of these cases has\nnot at all been considered in Alister's case.\n35. In the former case, it has been held in paras 4 and 5\nas under:\n\"4. Section 304-A carves out a specific offence\nwhere death is caused by doing a rash or negligent act\nand that act does not amount to culpable homicide under\nSection 299 IPC or murder under Section 300 IPC. If a\nperson wilfully drives a motor vehicle into the midst of a\ncrowd and thereby causes death to some persons, it will\nnot be a case of mere rash and negligent driving and the\nact will amount to culpable homicide. Each case will,\ntherefore, depend upon the particular facts established\nagainst the accused.\nB\nC\nD\nE\n5. The prosecution in this case wanted to establish a F\nmotive for committing the offence against the sarpanch. It\nwas sought to be established that there was enmity\nbetween the sarpanch and the accused and his relations\non account of panchayat elections. Some evidence was\nled in order to prove that the accused and his relations G\nwere gunning against the sarpanch for some time after the\nlatter's election as sarpanch. Even an anonymous letter\nwas received by the sarpanch threatening his life which\nwas handed over to the police by the sarpanch. Both the\nSessions Judge as well as the High Court did not accept H\nA\nB\n—Å\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n942\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2012] 12 S.C.R.\nthe evidence appertaining to motive. Mr. Mukherjee,\ntherefore, rightly and very fairly did not address us with\nregard to that part of the case. Even so, the learned\nCounsel submits that the act per se and the manner in\nwhich the vehicle was driven clearly brought the case under\nSection 304 Part II IPC.\"\nIt is further held in the same judgment at para 10 as under:\n\"10. Section 304-A, by its own definition totally\nexcludes the ingredients of Section 299 or Section 300,\nI.P.C. Doing an act with the intent to kill a person or\nknowledge that doing of an act was likely to cause a\nperson's death are ingredients of the offence of culpable\nhomicide. When intent or knowledge as described above\nis the direct motivating force of the act complained of,\nSection 304 A has to make room for the graver and more\nserious charge of culpable homicide.\"\nIt is interesting to note that this judgment had been a sheet\nanchor of arguments of both the learned senior counsel\nappearing for parties. They have read it differently and have\ntried to put different interpretations to the same.\nIn the latter case of Naresh Giri it has been held in the Head\nnote as under:\n\"Section 304 A IPC applies to cases where there is\nno intention to cause death and no knowledge that the act\ndone in all probability will cause death. The provision is\ndirected at offences outside the range of Sections 299 and\n300 IPC. Section 304 A applies only to such acts which\nare rash and negligent and are directly the cause of death\nof another person. Negligence and rashness are essential\nelements under Section 304-A.\nSection 304 A carves out a specific offence where\ndeath is caused by doing a rash or negligent act and that\nact does not amount to culpable homicide under Section\nSTATE TR. P.S. LODHI COLONY NEW DELHI v. 943\nSANJEEV NANDA [DEEPAK VERMA, J.]\n299 or murder under Section 300. If a person willfully A\ndrives a motor vehicle into the midst of a crowd and\nthereby causes death to some person, it will not be a case\nof mere rash and negligent driving and the act will amount\nto culpable homicide. Doing an act with the intent to kill a\nperson or knowledge that doing an act was likely to cause B\na person's death is culpable homicide. When intent or\nknowledge is the direct motivating force of the act, Section\n304 A has to make room for the graver and more serious\ncharge of culpable homicide.\"\nWe may profitably deal with definition of 'Reckless' as\ndefined in Lexicon, which reads as under:-\nC\n\"Characterized by the creation of a substantial and\nunjustifiable risk of harm to others and by a conscious (and\nsometimes deliberate) disregard for or indifference to that D\nrisk; heedless; rash. Reckless conduct is much more than\nmere negligence: it is a gross deviation from what a\nreasonable person would do. (Black, 7th Edn. 1999)\nIntention cannot exist without foresight, but foresight\ncan exist without intention. For a man may foresee the\npossible or even probable consequences of his conduct\nand yet not desire them to occur; none the less if he\npersists on his course he knowingly runs the risk of\nbringing about the unwished result. To describe this state\nof mind the word \"reckless\" is the most appropriate.\"\n36. For our own benefit it is appropriate to reproduce\nSection 304 of the IPC, which reads thus:\nE\nF\n\"304. Punishment for culpable homicide not amounting to G\nmurder -\nWhoever commits culpable homicide not amounting to\nmurder shall be punished with imprisonment for life, or\nimprisonment of either description for a term which may\nH\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nI\n944\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2012] 12 S.C.R.\nextend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine, if the\nact by which the death is caused is done with the intention\nof causing death, or of causing such bodily injury as is likely\nto cause death,\nor with imprisonment of either description for a term\nwhich may extend to ten years, or with fine, or with both, if\nthe act is done with the knowledge that it is likely to cause\ndeath, but without any intention to cause death, or to cause\nsuch bodily injury as is likely to cause death.\"\n37. Critical and microscopic analysis thereof shows that\nonce knowledge that it is likely to cause death is established\nbut without any intention to cause death, then jail sentence may\nbe for a term which may extend to 10 years or with fine or with\nboth.\n38. Now, we have to consider if it is a fit case where\nconviction should be altered to Section 304 Part II of IPC and\nsentence awarded should be enhanced.\n39. We are of the considered view that looking to the nature\nand manner in which accident had taken place, it can safely\nbe held that he had no intention to cause death but certainly\nhad the knowledge that his act may result in death.\n40. Thus, looking to the matter from all angles, we have\nno doubt in our mind that knowledge can still be attributed to\naccused Sanjeev that his act might cause such bodily injuries\nwhich may, in ordinary course of nature, be sufficient to cause\ndeath but certainly he did not have any intention to cause death.\nHe was not driving the vehicle with that intention. There is\nnothing to prove that he knew that a group of persons was\nstanding on the road he was going to pass through. If that be\nso, there cannot be an intention to cause death or such bodily\ninjury as is likely to cause death. Thus, in our opinion, he had\ncommitted an offence under Section 304 Part II IPC. We\naccordingly hold so.\nSTATE TR. P.S. LODHI COLONY NEW DELHI v. 945\nSANJEEV NANDA [DEEPAK VERMA, J.]\n41. Now the greater question that arises for consideration A\nis if sentence deserves to be suitably enhanced or the same\ncan be maintained as awarded by the High Court, the period\nwhich the Respondent has already undergone.\n42. To do complete justice between the parties we have\nto weigh aggravating and mitigating circumstances to find out\non which side justice tilts more.\nB\n43. In fact, the aggravating and mitigating circumstances\nhave been mentioned in detail in the preceding paras. We have\ngiven our serious thought to the whole matter and are of the C\nconsidered opinion that mitigating circumstances as mentioned\nin para 26 hereinabove are heavier than the aggravating\ncircumstances. The balance of justice tilts more in favour of\nthe accused.\n44. In the case in hand, no useful purpose is going to be\nserved by sending the respondent accused Sanjeev Nanda to\njail once again. Even though in the facts and circumstances of\nthe case, jail sentence awarded to him may not be just and\nappropriate but as mentioned hereinabove, the mitigating\ncircumstances tilt heavily in favour of the accused.\n45. In the light of the aforesaid discussion, the appeal is\npartly allowed. The judgment and order of conviction passed\nby Delhi High Court is partly set aside and the order of\nconviction of Trial Court is restored and upheld. Accused is\nheld guilty under Section 304 Part II of the IPC. Looking to the\nfacts and circumstances of the same, we deem it appropriate\nto maintain the sentence awarded by the High Court, which he\nhas already undergone. However, we make it clear that this\nhas been held so, looking to very peculiar facts and features\nof this particular case and it may not be treated as a precedent\nof general proposition of law on the point, for other cases.\n46. Appeal stands allowed to the aforesaid extent.\nAccused has already undergone the sentence awarded to him\nD\nLU\nE\nF\nG\nH\n946 SUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2012] 12 S.C.R.\nA by the High Court. Thus, he need not undergo any further\nsentence.\n1. Delay condoned.\nB\nORDER\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\n2. Leave granted.\n3. In the light of separate judgments pronounced by us\ntoday, the judgment and order of conviction passed by Delhi\nHigh Court under Section 304A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC)\nis set aside and the order of conviction of Trial Court under\nSection 304 Part II of the I.P.C. is restored and upheld.\nHowever, we deem it appropriate to maintain the sentence\nawarded by the High Court, which the accused has already\nundergone.\n4. In addition, the accused is put to the following terms:\n(1) Accused has to pay an amount of Rs.50 lakh (Rupees\nFifty lakh) to the Union of India within six months, which will\nbe utilized for providing compensation to the victim of\nmotor accidents, where the vehicle owner, driver etc. could\nnot be traced, like victims of hit and run cases. On default,\nhe will have to undergo simple imprisonment for one year.\nThis amount be kept in a different head to be used for the\naforesaid purpose only.\n(2) The accused would do community service for two years\nwhich will be arranged by the Ministry of Social Justice and\nEmpowerment within two months. On default, he will have\nto undergo simple imprisonment for two years.\nThe Appeal is accordingly allowed in terms of the\njudgments and this common order.\nH\nK.K.T.\nAppeal Partly allowed.\n"}
