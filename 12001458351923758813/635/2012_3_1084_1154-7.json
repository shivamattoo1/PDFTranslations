{"pages":[{"pageNumber":71}],"text":"1154 SUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2012] 3 S.C.R.\nA party as till then there was no Symbols Order\", came to the\nconclusion that the submission of the Election Commission is\nacceptable. It was held at para 15:\nB\nC\nD\n‡πÅ\n... the respondent is undoubtedly correct in\narguing that concept of recognition is inextricably\nconnected with the concept of symbol of that party. It is but\nnatural that a party must have a following and it is only a\npolitical party having substantial following in terms of\nClauses 6A, 6B and 6C would have a right for a reserved\nsymbol. Thus, in our opinion, it is perfectly in consonance\nwith the democratic principles. A party which remains only\nin the records can never be equated and given the status\nof a recognised political party in the democratic set up.\nWe have, therefore, no hesitation in rejecting the argument\nof Dr. Swamy that in providing the symbols and reserving\nthem for the recognised political parties alone amounted\nto an undemocratic act.\"\nIn my opinion, this Court, failed to appreciate that in a\n\"democratic set up\", while the majorities rule, minorities are\nE entitled to protection. Otherwise, the mandate of Article 14\nwould be meaningless. If democracies are all about only\nnumbers, Hitler was a great democrat. The status of majority\nor minority, even an insignificant minority, could only be\ntransient. Further, the question as to what is the legitimate\npurpose sought to be achieved by the classification under the\nSymbols Order, was not considered.\nF\nG\n60. For all the abovementioned reasons, I would hold that\nthe Symbols Order, insofar as it denies the reservation of a\nsymbol for the exclusive allotment of the candidates set up by\na political party with \"insignificant poll performance\", is violative\nof Article 14 of the Constitution of India.\nR.P.\nWrit Petitions dismissed.\nH\n"}
