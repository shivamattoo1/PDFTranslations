Explanation IV to S.2(1)(e) of Andhra Pradesh General Sales\n530\n1\n¦\nGOVERNMENT OF ANDHRA PRADESH v.

According to Craies on Statute Law, Seventh Edition, a Declaratory\nAct is an Act to remove doubts existing in the common law, or the meaning or\nthe effect of any statute. Such Acts are usually held to be retrospective. On\nthe other hand Consolidating Acts are Acts enacted to consolidate in one Act B\nthe provisions contained in a number of statutes, as for example the Customs\nand Excise Act, Income-tax Act, Companies Act etc. [Para 11] [537-A-B]\n2.2. An explanation must be read ordinarily to clear up any ambiguity\nin the main section and it cannot be construed to widen the ambit of the\nsection. However, if on a true reading of an Explanation it appears to the Court C\nin a given case that the effect of the Explanation is to widen the scope of the\nmain section then effect must be given to the legislative intent. In all such\ncases the Court has to find out the true intention of the Legislature. Therefore,\nthere is no single yardstick to decide whether an Explanation is enacted to\nclarify the ambiguity or whether it is enacted to widen the scope of the main\nsection. [Para 12] [537-D-E]\nBihta Co-operative Development and Cane Marketing Union Ltd. and\nAnr. v. Bank of Bihar and Ors., AIR [1967] SC 389, relied on.\nᎠ\n2.3. Prior to the Amending Act No. 27 of 1996, there was no Explanation\ncovering banks, L.I.Cs. etc. Explanation IV was added by the first time by the\nsaid Amending Act No. 27 of 1996. The definition of the word \"dealer\" thus E\nstands expanded by the said Amending Act. Therefore, Explanation IV was\nnot to clear any doubt or ambiguity. It has been enacted in order to expand the\ndefinition of the word \"dealer” in s.2(1)(e) of the 1957 Act.\n[Para 12] [537-F-G]\nF\n3.1. The object of interpretation is to discover the intention of the\nLegislature. The Court has to examine whether an Explanation inserted by\nthe Amending Act was to clear the ambiguity or whether it provided for\nexpansion by introducing a deeming provision. The deeming provision\ngenerally is intended to enlarge the meaning of the particular word or to\ninclude matters which otherwise may not fall within the main provision.\n[Para 13] [538-A-B]\nDoypack Systems (Pvt.) Ltd. v. Union of India, [1988] 36 E.L.T. 201,\nrelied on.\n3.2. Applying the above test, it is seen that in Explanation IV, there is\nG\nH\n1\n532\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 4 S.C.R.\nA an in-built deeming provision so as to include L.I.C.s, financial institutions,\ncompanies and banks mentioned in the Second Schedule to the Reserve Bank\nof India Act, 1934 within the definition of the word “dealer” in s.2(1)(e) of\nthe 1957 Act. Therefore, the object of Explanation IV containing such deeming\nprovision is to expand the meaning of the word \"dealer\" and, therefore, it\ncannot be read as a retrospective enactment so as to cover old transactions of\nthe past. It is for that reason that even the Legislature while enacting Act No.\n27 of 1996 has stated that the provisions thereof shall come into force with\neffect from 1.8.96 which is one more circumstance to show that the Amending\nAct was not to operate before 1.8.96. [Para 16] [539-B]\nB\nC\nM/s Keshavji Ravji and Co. etc., etc., v. Commissioner of Income-Tax,\nAIR (1191)) SC 1806 and M/s Aphali Pharmaceuticals Ltd. v. State of\nMaharashtra and Ors., AIR [1989] SC 2227, relied on.\n4. Further, this case is concerned with an indirect tax, the incidence of\nwhich falls on the borrower/pledgor. The auction sale is as far back as on\nD 19.8.87. The transaction has concluded since then. The Bank (respondent) is\nnot expected to recover the tax from the pledgor in respect of old auction sales,\nwhich took place much prior to 1.8.96. [Para 16] [539-C]\nE\nF\nCIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 299 of 2002.\nFrom the Final Judgment and Order dated 08.06.2001 of the High Court\nof Judicature of Andhra Pradesh at Hyderabad in W.P. No. 10997 of 1990.\nJune G. Chaudhary, Sr. Adv., Manoj Saxena, Rajnish Kr. Singh and Rahul\nShukla, Advs. With him for the Appellants.\nT. L. V. Iyer, G. Prakash and S. N. Bhat, Advs. With him for the\nRespondents.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nKAPADIA, J. 1. A short question which arises for determination in this\nG civil appeal filed by the State (appellants) is: whether pledging of ornaments\nwith the Bank against a loan and sale of such goods if the loan is not\ndischarged, would be “business” within the meaning of Section 2(1)(e) of the\nAndhra Pradesh General Sales Tax, 1957 read with Explanation IV thereto.\n2. On 3.4.89 the Commercial Tax Officer, Warangal, issued demand notice\nH on respondent-Bank for payment of tax on turnover of auction sale of jewellery\n1\nGOVERNMENT OF ANDHRA PRADESH v. CORPORATION BANK [KAPADIA, J.] 533\nheld on 19.8.87 under Section 5 read with Explanation IV of Andhra Pradesh A\nGeneral Sales Tax Act, 1957 (\"the 1957 Act\", for short). In this connection\nreliance was placed on Section 2(1)(e) read with Explanation IV of the 1957\nAct.\n3. Aggrieved by the demand notice, the respondent-Bank filed writ\npetition before the High Court challenging the legality of the notice. In the B\nwrit petition the respondent-Bank contended that the provisions of the 1957\nAct are not applicable to banking transactions.\n4. By judgment dated 8.6.01 the Division Bench allowed the writ petition\nquashing the impugned notices holding that Banks are not amenable to sales\ntax on sale of gold pledged with the Banks as security for loan. Hence this\ncivil appeal by the State (appellants).\n5. At the outset we may point out that in the civil appeal filed by the\nState (appellants), the entire emphasis is placed on Explanation IV to Section\n2(1)(e) of the 1957 Act which was inserted by Act No. 27 of 1996 by which\nthe definition of the word \"dealer\" was expanded to cover banks, L.I.Cs. and\nfinancial institutions. Therefore, the question which we have to answer in this\ncivil appeal is: whether Explanation IV of the 1957 Act would operate\nretrospectively, particularly, since in the present case the notice given to the\nBank pertains to the auction sale of ornaments held on 19.8.87.\n6. Act No. 27 of 1996 was an Amending Act. It received the assent of\nthe Governor on 15.10.96. It was published on 17.10.96 in the Andhra Pradesh\nGazette. It was preceded by an Ordinance. The said Amending Act operated\nwith effect from 1.8.96. It is so specifically stated in the said Act No. 27 of\n1996.\n7. For deciding the above controversy we quote hereinbelow the amended\nSection 2(1)(e) read with Explanation IV of the 1957 Act:\nC\nD\nE\nF\nستم\n7\n“Section 2.-Definitions:- (1) In this Act, unless the context otherwise\nrequires:-\nG\n(e) \"dealer” means any person who carries on the business of buying\nselling, supplying or distributing goods or delivering goods on hire\npurchase or on any system of payment by instalments, or carries on\nor executes any works contract involving supply or use of material\ndirectly or otherwise, whether for cash, or for deferred payment, or for\nH\nA\nB\nC\nD\n(I)\nE\n534\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 4 S.C.R.\ncommission, remuneration or other valuable consideration, and includes-\n(i)\nlocal authority, a company, a Hindu undivided family or any\nsociety (including a co-operative society), club, firm or association\nwhich carries on such business;\n(ii) a society (including a co-operative society), club firm or\nassociation which buys goods from or sells, supplied or distributes\ngoods to its members;\n(iii) a casual traders, as hereinbefore defined;\n(iii-a) any person, who may, in the course of business of running a\nrestaurant or an eating house or a hotel (by whatever name\ncalled), supply by way of or as part of any service or in\nany other\nmanner whatsoever, of goods, being food or any other article for\nhuman consumption or any drink (whether or not intoxicating);\n(iii-b) any person, who may transfer the right to the use of any goods\nfor any purpose, whatsoever (whether or not for a specified\nperiod) in the course of business to any other person;\n(iv) a commission agent, a broker, a del credere agent, an auctioneer\nor any other mercantile agent, by whatever name called, who\ncarries on the business of buying, selling, supplying or\ndistributing goods on behalf of any principal or principals;\nExplanation I:-Every person who acts as an ‘agent of a non-resident\ndealer', that is, as an agent on behalf of a dealer residing outside the\nstate, and buys, sells, supplies or distributes goods in the State or\nacts on behalf of such dealer as-\nF\n(i)\n☐ G\n☐ H\n(ii)\na mercantile agent as defined in the Indian Sale of Goods Act,\n1930 (Central Act III of 1930); or\nan agent for handling goods or documents of title relating to\ngoods, or\n(iii) an agent for the collection or the payment of the sale price of\ngoods or as a guarantor for such collection or payment and every\nlocal branch of a firm or company situated outside the State, shall\nbe deemed to be a dealer for the purpose of this Act;\nExplanation II:- Where a grower of agricultural or horticultural produce\nsells such produce grown by himself or grown on any land in which\n1\nশ\nGOVERNMENT OF ANDHRA PRADESH v.

The 1957 Act has been enacted to consolidate and amend the law\nrelating to levy of general tax on the sale/purchase of goods in the State of\nAndhra Pradesh. Under Section 2(1)(e) the word \"dealer” was defined to mean\nany person who carried on the business of buying, selling or distributing\ngoods, directly or otherwise, whether for cash or for deferred payment or for\ncommission, remuneration or other valuable consideration. The original\ndefinition of the word \"dealer\" referred to any person who carried on business\nof selling goods for cash or deferred payment or other valuable consideration.\nThat definition led to litigation when demand notices were issued to Banks\ncalling upon the said Banks to pay tax on sale of pledged jewellery/ornaments\nD for default on the part of the borrower/pledgor. The Banks contended that\nthey were not in the business of pawn-broking. They contended that the\nornaments/gold pledged with them were sold pursuant to the instructions\ngiven by the pledgor. They contended that they were not the owners of the\nsaid gold/ornaments. They contended that sale of the pledged gold/ornaments\ndid not fall \"in the course of their business\" under Section 2(1)(e) of the 1957\nAct. These contentions were accepted by the High Court. Consequently, the\nState Legislature enacted Act. No. 27 of 1996 by which Explanation IV was\ninserted in the 1957 Act. That Explanation, inter alia, has sought to cover\nL.I.Cs., financial corporations, companies and banks falling in Second Schedule\nto the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934. The constitutional validity of the said\nF Amending Act. No. 27 of 1996 has not been challenged in the present\nproceeding by the Bank (respondent).\nE\n9. As stated above, in the civil appeal filed by the State (appellants) the\nonly contention raised is that with the enactment of the Amending Act No.27\nof 1996 banks have been included in the definition of the word \"dealer”.\nG Therefore, we are only required to consider whether the said Amending Act.\nNo.27 of 1996 applied retrospectively to the auction sale held on 19.8.87.\nH\n10. The nature of Explanation has been the matter of a statutory\ninterpretation in number of judgments of this Court.\n11. According to Craies on Statute Law, Seventh Edition, at page 58, a\nGOVERNMENT OF ANDHRA PRADESH v. CORPORATION BANK [KAPADIA, J.] 537\nDeclaratory Act is an Act to remove doubts existing in the common law, or A\nthe meaning or the effect of any statute. Such Acts are usually held to be\nretrospective. On the other hand Consolidating Acts are Acts enacted to\nconsolidate in one Act the provisions contained in a number of statutes, as\nfor example the Customs and Excise Act, Income-tax Act, Companies Act. etc.\nC\nᎠ\n12. In construing a statutory provision, the first and foremost rule of B\nconstruction is the literary construction. If the provision is unambiguous and\nif from that provision, the legislative intent is clear, we need not call into aid\nthe other rules of construction. The other rules of construction are invoked\nwhen the legislative intent is not clear. In Bihta Co-operative Development\nand Cane Marketing Union Ltd. and Anr. v. Bank of Bihar and Ors., AIR\n(1967) SC 389, this Court was called upon to consider Explanation to Section\n48(1) of Bihar and Orissa Co-operative Societies Act, 1935. This Court observed\nthat the Court should not go only by the label. The Court observed that an\nExplanation must be read ordinarily to clear up any ambiguity in the main\nsection and it cannot be construed to widen the ambit of the section. However,\nif on a true reading of an Explanation it appears to the Court in a given case\nthat the effect of the Explanation is to widen the scope of the main section\nthen effect must be given to the legislative intent. It was held that in all such\ncases the Court has to find out the true intention of the Legislature. Therefore,\nthere is no single yardstick to decide whether an Explanation is enacted to\nclarify the ambiguity or whether it is enacted to widen the scope of the main\nsection. On the facts it was held that before 1948 Amendment to the Bihar\nand Orissa Co-operative Societies Act, 1935, there was an Explanation on the\nStatute Book and the subsequent Explanation was only to clarify the earlier\nExplanation and, therefore, the Court held that the purpose of the subsequent\nExplanation was not to enlarge the scope of Section 48(1)(e) in the Bihar and\nOrissa Co-operative Societies Act, 1935. In the present case prior to the F\nAmending Act. No.27 of 1996, there was no Explanation covering banks,\nL.I.Cs. etc. As stated above, Explanation IV was added by the first time by\nthe said Amending Act No.27 of 1996. The definition of the word \"dealer\"\nthus stands expanded by the said Amending Act No.27 of 1996. In our view,\ntherefore, Explanation IV was not to clear any doubt or ambiguity. It has been\nenacted in order to expand the definition of the word \"dealer” in Section\n2(1)(e) of the 1957 Act.\nE\nG\n13. In the case of Doypack Systems (Pvt.) Ltd. v. Union of India, (1988)\n36 E.L.T. 201, this Court has held that the internal aids of construction and\ndefinitions, exceptions, explanations, fictions, deeming provisions, headings, H\nT\nB\n538\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 4 S.C.R.\nA marginal notes, preamble, provisos, punctuations, saving clauses, non-obstante\nclauses etc. It was observed that the object of interpretation is to discover\nthe intention of the Legislature. It was further observed that the Court has\nto examine whether an Explanation inserted by the Amending Act was to clear\nthe ambiguity or whether it provided for expansion by introducing a deeming\nprovision. The Court further held that deeming provision generally is intended\nto enlarge the meaning of the particular word or to include matters which\notherwise may not fall within the main provision [See: para '64']. Applying\nthe above test to the present case, we find from the Explanation IV, quoted\nabove, that in that Explanation there is an in-built deeming provision so as\nto include L.I.Cs, financial institutions, companies and banks mentioned in the\nC Second Schedule to the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 within the definition\nof the word \"dealer” in Section 2(1)(e) of the 1957 Act. Therefore, the object\nof the Explanation IV containing such deeming provisions is to expand the\nmeaning of the word \"dealer” and, therefore, it cannot be read as a retrospective\nenactment so as to cover old transactions of the past. It is for that reason\nthat even the Legislature while enacting Act No.27 of 1996 has stated that\nD\nthe provisions thereof shall come into force with effect from 1.8.96 which is\none more circumstance to show that the Amending Act was not to operate\nbefore 1.8.96.\nE\nF\n14. In the case of M/s. Keshavji Ravji and Co. etc., etc., v. Commissioner\nof Income-tax, AIR (1991) SC 1806, this Court observed in para '14' that there\nis no general theory as to the effect and intention of an Explanation, though\ngenerally the purpose of Explanation is to clarify the doubts. However, this\nCourt further held that an Explanation can also supply something to the\ncontent of the provision and in such a case the Court has to consider its\neffect, whether it is retrospective or prospective.\n15. In the case of M/s. Aphali Pharmaceuticals Ltd. v. State of\nMaharashtra and Ors., AJR (1989) SC 2227, this Court found that in the earlier\nExplanation in the Medicinal and Toilet Preparations (Excise Duties) Act, 1955\ncertain changes were made by way of another Explanation brought in by the\nFinance Act, 1962 with retrospective effect. The Court upheld the contention\nG advanced on behalf of the State that the new Explanation was retrospective.\nH\nWhile doing so the Court observed that the impugned Explanation has not\naltered the existing classification in the Schedule so as to impose a new\nliability and, therefore, the impugned Explanation was clarificatory and\nretrospective.\nGOVERNMENT OF ANDHRA PRADESH v. CORPORATION BANK [KAPADIA, J.] 539\n16. Applying the above test to the present case, we find that by A\nExplanation IV to Section 2(1)(e) of the 1957 Act, banks, financial institutions\netc. are sought to be covered by an in-built expression \"deeming provision\"\nin the said Explanation. By the said deeming fiction the meaning of the\n\"dealer\" is sought to be expanded so as to include banks, financial institutions,\nL.I.Cs. etc. By the said explanation a liability is sought to be created for the\nB\nfirst time on banks, financial institutions, L.I.Cs. etc. Further, we are concerned\nwith an indirect tax, the incidence of which falls on the borrower/pledgor. The\nauction sale in the present case is as far back as on 19.8.87. The transaction\nhas concluded since then. The Bank (respondent) is not expected to recover\nthe tax from the pledgor in respect of old auction sales which took place much\nprior to 1.8.96.\nC\n17. For the above reasons, we are not required to examine the larger\nquestion as to whether the transaction took place in the course of the\nbusiness of the Bank. Though, this question has been examined in the\nimpugned judgment by the High Court we are not required to examine those\nquestions, particularly, when the law has been amended prospectively and D\nalso because the civil appeal filed by the State (appellants) is entirely based\non the insertion of Explanation IV vide amending Act No.27 of 1996.\n18. Before concluding we may clarify that Explanation IV would apply\nto transactions on and after 1.8.1996.\n19. Subject to above, the civil appeal filed by the State (appellants)\nstands disposed of with no order as to costs.\nD.G.\nAppeal disposed of.\nE\n"}
