He worked for period of 145\ndays in sub Division No.2 for period of October 94 to Feb., 1995. He, however,\nworked in Sub-division No.3 for a period of 90 days from March, 95 to July, F\n95.

He raised industrial dispute.\nThe Industrial Tribunal directed his reinstatement and full back wages\non the ground that the services rendered by respondent in both the Divisions\nshould be counted for the purpose of s.25F r/w. s.25B of Industrial Disputes\nAct, 1947. Appellant employer unsuccessfully filed the writ petition. Hence G\nthe present appeal.\nPartly allowing the appeal, the Court\nHELD: 1. The two Sub-Divisions constituted two different\n1091\nH\n1\n1092\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 4 S.C.R.\nA establishments. Only because there is one Controlling Authority, the same\nby itself would not mean that the establishments were not separate. [Para 3]\n[1093-G; 1094-A]\n2. Respondent did not produce before the Industrial Tribunal-cum-\nLabour Court his offers of appointment. If offers of appointment had been\nB issued in his favour by the two Sub-Divisions separately, the same ipso facto\nwould lead to the conclusion that they were separate and distinct. If his\nappointment was only on the basis of entry in the muster roll(s), the\ndesignation of the authority who was authorized to appoint him as a daily-\nwager would be the determinative factor. It is not the case of the respondent\nthat he was appointed in both the establishments by the same authority.\n[Para 4] [1094-B]\nC\nD\n3. The Industrial Tribunal-cum-Labour Court unfortunately did not go\ninto the said question at all. If both the establishments are treated to be one\nestablishment, for the purpose of reckoning continuity of service within the\nmeaning of s.25B of the Act, as was held by the Tribunal, a person working\nat different point of time in different establishments of the statutory authority,\nwould be entitled to claim reinstatement on the basis thereof. However, in that\nevent, one establishment even may not know that the workman had worked in\nanother establishment. In absence of such acknowledge, the authority\nretrenching the workman concerned would not be able to comply with the\nE statutory provisions contained in s.25F of the Act. Thus, once two\nestablishments are held to be separate and distinct having different cadre\nstrength of the workmen, if any, the period during which the workman was\nworking in one establishment would not enure to his benefit when he was\nrecruited separately in another establishment, particularly when he was not\ntransferred from one Sub-Division to the other. [Para 5] [1094-C-E]\nF\nG\nH\nUnion of India and Ors. v. Jummasha Diwan, [2006] 8 SCC 544,\nreferred to.\n4. Moreover, it is now also well-settled that despite a wide discretionary\npower conferred upto the Industrial Courts under s.11A of the 1947 Act, the\nrelief of reinstatement with full back-wages should not be granted\nautomatically only because it would be lawful to do so. Grant of relief would\ndepend on the fact situation obtaining in each case. It will depend upon several\nfactors; one of which would be as to whether the recruitment was effected in\nterms of the statutory provisions operating in the field. [Para 7] [1095-B-C]\n5. Respondent worked for a very short period. He only worked in 1994-\nHARYANA URBAN DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY v. OM PAL [S.B. SINHA, J.] 1093\n95. The Industrial Tribunal-cum-Labour Court, therefore, committed an A\nillegality, while passing an award in the year 2003, directing the reinstatement\nof the respondent with full back-wages. Although the respondent was not\nentitled to any relief, whatsoever, the appellant is directed to pay him a sum of\nRs.25,000/-. [Para 8] [1095-D]\nCIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 1869 of 2007.\nFrom the Judgment and Order dated 08.04.2004 of the High Court of\nPunjab and Haryana at Chandigarh in CWP No. 5948 of 2004.\nB\nSatinder Gulati, Kamaldeep Narang and Dr. Kailash Chand for the\nAppellant.\nC\nSanjay Bansal, Reepak Kansal and G.K. Bansal for the Respondent.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nS.B. SINHA, J. 1. Leave granted.\nD\n2. Respondent herein was appointed as a daily-wager. From October, ·\n1994 to February, 1995, he worked for a period of 145 days in Sub-Division\nNo.2, Panipat. He, however, worked in Sub-Division No.3 for a period of 90\ndays from March 1995 to July, 1995. His services were terminated. An industrial\ndispute was raised questioning validity of the said order of termination. The E\nsaid industrial dispute was referred by the Appropriate Government to the\nIndustrial Tribunal-cum-Labour Court, Panipat, for its determination. It was\nregistered as Reference No.59 of 1999. By an award dated 28.2.2003, the\nIndustrial Court on the premise that the services rendered by the respondent\nin both the Sub-Divisions should be counted for the purpose of Section 25F\nread with Section 25B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, directed his\nreinstatement with continuity of service and full back-wages from the date of\ndemand notice i.e. 14.9.1995. A writ petition filed thereagainst by the appellant\nherein was dismissed. The appellant has, therefore, filed this appeal by special\nleave.\n3. The short question which arises for consideration by us in this\nappeal is as to whether in the aforementioned fact situation, the Industrial\nTribunal-cum-Labour Court was justified in directing reinstatement of the\nrespondent with full back-wages and continuity of service. It has not been\ndenied or disputed that the two Sub-Divisions constituted two different\nF\nG\nH\n1094\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 4 S.C.R.\nA establishments. Only because there is one Controlling Authority, the same by\nitself would not mean that the establishments were not separate.\n4. Respondent did not produce before the Industrial Tribunal-cum-\nLabour Court his offers of appointment. If offers of appointment had been\nissued in his favour by the two Sub-Divisions separately, the same ipso facto\nB would lead to the conclusion that they were separate and distinct. If his\nappointment was only on the basis of entry in the muster roll(s), the\ndesignation of the authority who was authorised to appoint him as a daily-\nwager would be the determinative factor. It is not the case of the respondent\nthat he was appointed in both the establishments by the same authority.\nC\n5. The Industrial Tribunal-cum-Labour Court unfortunately did not go\ninto the said question at all. If both the establishments are treated to be one\nestablishment, for the purpose of reckoning continuity of service within the\nmeaning of Section 25B of the Act, as was held by the Tribunal, a person\nworking at different point of time in different establishments of the statutory\nD authority, would be entitled to claim reinstatement on the basis thereof.\nHowever, in that event, one establishment even may not know that the\nworkman had worked in another establishment. In absence of such a\nknowledge, the authority retrenching the workman concerned would not be\nable to comply with the statutory provisions contained in Section 25F of the\nAct. Thus, once two establishments are held to be separate and distinct\nhaving different cadre strength of the workmen, if any, we are of the opinion\nthat the period during which the workman was working in one establishment\nwould not enure to his benefit when he was recruited separately in another\nestablishment, particularly when he was not transferred from one Sub-Division\nto the other. In this case he was appointed merely on daily wages.\nE\nF\nG\nH\n6. In Union of India and Ors v. Jummasha Diwan, [2006] 8 SCC 544, this\nCourt opined:\n\"....There are several establishments of the Railway Administration. If\na workman voluntarily gives up his job in one of the establishments\nand joins another, the same would not amount to his being in\ncontinuous service. When a casual employee is employed in different\nestablishments, may be under the same employer, e.g., the Railway\nAdministration of India as a whole, having different administrative\nset-ups, different requirements and different projects, the concept of\ncontinuous service cannot be applied and it cannot be said that even\nin such a situation he would be entitled to a higher status being in\nA\nHARYANA URBAN DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY v. OM PAL [S.B. SINHA, J.] 1095\ncontinuous service. It is not in dispute that the establishment of A\nAppellant 3 herein had started a project. His recruitment in the said\nestablishment would, therefore, constitute a fresh employment. In a\ncase of this nature, the Respondent would not be entitled to his\nseniority. If the project came to a close, the requirements of Section\n25-N of the Act were not required to be complied with.\"\n7. Moreover, it is now also well-settled that despite a wide discretionary\npower conferred upon the Industrial Courts under Section 11A of the 1947\nAct, the relief of reinstatement with full back-wages should not be granted\nautomatically only because it would be lawful to do so. Grant of relief would\ndepend on the fact situation obtaining in each case. It will depend upon\nseveral factors; one of which would be as to whether the recruitment was\neffected in terms of the statutory provisions operating in the field, if any.\nB\nC\n8. Respondent worked for a very short period. He only worked, as\nnoticed hereinbefore, in 1994-95. The Industrial Tribunal-cum-Labour Court,\ntherefore, in our opinion committed an illegality, while passing an award in the D\nyear 2003, directing the reinstatement of the respondent with full back-wages.\nAlthough we are of the opinion that the respondent was not entitled to any\nrelief, whatsoever, we direct the appellant to pay him a sum of Rs.25,000/-.\n9. This appeal is allowed to the aforementioned extent. However, in the\nfacts and circumstances of this case, there shall be no order as to costs.\nD.G.\nAppeal allowed.\nE\n"}
