The term 'Courts' refers to places where justice is E\nadministered or refers to Judges who exercise judicial\nfunctions. Courts are established by the state for administration\nof justice that is for exercise of the judicial power of the state\nto maintain and uphold the rights, to punish wrongs and to\nadjudicate upon disputes. Tribunals on the other hand are\nspecial alternative institutional mechanisms, usually brought into\nexistence by or under a statute to decide disputes arising with\nreference to that particular statute, or to determine controversies\narising out of any administrative law. Courts refer to Civil Courts,\nCriminal Courts and High Courts. Tribunals can be either\nprivate Tribunals (Arbitral Tribunals), or Tribunals constituted\nunder the Constitution (Speaker or the Chairman acting under\nPara 6(1) of the Tenth Schedule) or Tribunals authorized by the\nConstitution (Administrative Tribunals under Article 323A and\nTribunals for other matters under Article 323B) or Statutory\nG\nH\n902 SUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2010] 6 S.C.R.\nA Tribunals which are created under a statute (Motor Accident\nClaims Tribunal, Debt Recovery Tribunals and consumer fora).\nSome Tribunals are manned exclusively by Judicial Officers\n(Rent Tribunals, Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal, Labour\nCourts and Industrial Tribunals). Other statutory Tribunals have\nJudicial and Technical Members (Administrative Tribunals,\nTDSAT, Competition Appellate Tribunal, Consumer fora, Cyber\nAppellate Tribunal, etc).\nB\nC\nD\nE\nLL\nF\nG\nH\n1.3. This court had attempted to point out the difference\nbetween Court and Tribunal in several decisions. We may refer\na few of them.\n(13.1) In Harinagar Sugar Mills Ltd. vs. Shyam Sundar\nJhunjhunwala - (1962) 2 SCR 339, Hidayatullah J., succinctly\nexplained the difference between Courts and Tribunals, thus:\n\"All Tribunals are not courts, though all courts are\nTribunals\". The word \"courts\" is used to designate those\nTribunals which are set up in an organized state for the\nadministration of justice. By administration of justice is\nmeant the exercise of juridical power of the state to\nmaintain and uphold rights and to punish \"wrongs‚Äù.\nWhenever there is an infringement of a right or an injury,\nthe courts are there to restore the vinculum juris, which is\ndisturbed\nWhen rights are infringed or invaded, the aggrieved party\ncan go and commence a querela before the ordinary Civil\nCourts. These Courts which are instrumentalities of\nGovernment, are invested with the judicial power of the\nState, and their authority is derived from the Constitution\nor some Act of Legislature constituting them. Their number\nis ordinarily fixed and they are ordinarily permanent, and\ncan try any suit or cause within their jurisdiction. Their\nnumbers may be increased or decreased, but they are\nalmost always permanent and go under the compendious\nname of \"Courts of Civil Judicature‚Äù. There can thus be no\nUNION OF INDIA v. R. GANDHI, PRESIDENT, MADRAS 903\nBAR ASSOCIATION [R.V. RAVEENDRAN, J.]\ndoubt that the Central Government does not come within A\nthis class.\nWith the growth of civilization and the problems of modern\nlife, a large number of administrative Tribunals have come\ninto existence. These Tribunals have the authority of law\nto pronounce upon valuable rights; they act in a judicial\nmanner and even on evidence on oath, but they are not\npart of the ordinary Courts of Civil Judicature. They share\nthe exercise of the judicial power of the State, but they are\nbrought into existence to implement some administrative\npolicy or to determine controversies arising out of some\nadministrative law. They are very similar to Courts, but are\nnot Courts. When the Constitution speaks of 'Courts' in\nArt. 136, 227, or 228 or in Arts. 233 to 237 or in the Lists,\nit contemplates Courts of Civil Judicature but not Tribunals\nother than such Courts. This is the reason for using both\nthe expressions in Arts. 136 and 227.\nB\nC\nD\nBy \"Courts\" is meant Courts of Civil Judicature and by\n\"Tribunals‚Äù, those bodies of men who are appointed to\ndecide controversies arising under certain special laws. E\nAmong the powers of the State is included the power to\ndecide such controversies. This is undoubtedly one of the\nattributes of the State, and is aptly called the judicial power\nof the State. In the exercise of this power, a clear division\nis thus noticeable. Broadly speaking, certain special\nmatters go before Tribunals, and the residue goes before\nthe ordinary Courts of Civil Judicature. Their procedures\nmay differ, but the functions are not essentially different.\nWhat distinguishes them has never been successfully\nestablished.\"\nIn my opinion, a Court in the strict sense is a Tribunal\nwhich is a part of the ordinary hierarchy of Courts of Civil\nJudicature maintained by the State under its constitution\nto exercise the judicial power of the State. These Courts\nperform all the judicial functions of the State except those\nEL\nF\nG\nH\n904\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2010] 6 S.C.R.\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nthat are excluded by law from their jurisdiction. The word\n\"judicial\", be it noted, is itself capable of two meanings.\nThey were admirably stated by Lopes, L.J. in Royal\nAquarium and Summer and Winter Garden Society v.\nParkinson [1892] 1 Q.B. 431, in these words:\n\"The word 'judicial' has two meanings. It may refer\nto the discharge of duties exercisable by a judge\nor by justices in court, or to administrative duties\nwhich need not be performed in court, but in\nrespect of which it is necessary to being to bear a\njudicial mind - that is, a mind to determine what is\nfair and just in respect of the matters under\nconsideration.\"\nThat an officer is required to decide matters before him\n\"judicially\" in the second sense does not make him a Court\nor even a Tribunal, because that only establishes that he\nis following a standard of conduct, and is free from bias\nor interest.\nCourts and Tribunals act \"judicially\" in both senses, and\nin the term \"Court\" are included the ordinary and\npermanent Tribunals and in the term \"Tribunal\" are\nincluded all others, which are not so included\".\n(emphasis supplied)\n(13.2) In Jaswant Sugar Mills vs. Laxmi Chand ‚Äì 1963\nSupp (1) SCR 242, this Court observed that in order to be a\nTribunal, a body or authority must, besides being under a duty\nto act judicially, should be invested with the judicial power of\nthe state.\n--\n(13.3) In Associated Cement Companies Ltd. vs. P. N.\nSharma (1965) 2 SCR 366, another Constitution Bench of\nthis Court explained the position of Tribunals thus:\n\"The expression \"court\" in the context denotes a Tribunal\nUNION OF INDIA v. R. GANDHI, PRESIDENT, MADRAS 905\nBAR ASSOCIATION [R.V. RAVEENDRAN, J.]\nconstituted by the State as a part of the ordinary hierarchy A\nof courts which are invested with the State's inherent\njudicial powers. A sovereign State discharges legislative,\nexecutive and judicial functions and can legitimately claim\ncorresponding powers which are described as legislative,\nexecutive and judicial powers. Under our Constitution, the B\njudicial functions and powers of the State are primarily\nconferred on the ordinary courts which have been\nconstituted under its relevant provisions. The Constitution\nrecognised a hierarchy of courts and their adjudication are\nnormally entrusted all disputes between citizens and\ncitizens as well as between the citizens and the State.\nThese courts can be described as ordinary courts of civil\njudicature. They are governed by their prescribed rules of\nprocedure and they deal with questions of fact and law.\nraised before them by adopting a process which in\ndescribed as judicial process. The powers which these\ncourts exercise, are judicial powers, the functions they\ndischarge are judicial functions and the decisions they\nreach and pronounce are judicial decisions.\nC\nD\nIn every State there are administrative bodies or authorities E\nwhich are required to deal with matters within their\njurisdiction in an administrative manner and their decisions\nare described as administrative decisions. In reaching their\nadministrative decisions, administrative bodies can and\noften to take into consideration questions of policy. It is not F\nunlikely that even in this process of reaching administrative\ndivisions, the administrative bodies or authorities are\nrequired to act fairly and objectively and would in many\ncases have to follow the principles of natural justice; but\nthe authority to reach decision conferred on such G\nadministrative bodies is clearly distinct and separate from\nthe judicial power conferred on courts, and the decisions.\npronounced by administrative bodies are similarly distinct\nand separate in character from judicial decision\npronounced by courts.\nH\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\n-\nG\n906\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2010] 6 S.C.R.\nTribunals which fall under the purview of Article 136(1)\noccupy a special position of their own under the scheme\nof our Constitution. Special matters and questions are\nentrusted to them for their decision and in that sense, they\nshare with the court one common characteristic; both the\ncourts and the Tribunals are constituted by the state and\nare invested with judicial as distinguished from purely\nadministrative or executive functions (vide Durga Shankar\nMehta v. Raghuraj Singh - 1955 (1) SCR 267). They are\nboth adjudicating bodies and they deal with and finally\ndetermine disputes between parties which are entrusted\nto their jurisdiction. The procedure followed by the courts\nis regularly prescribed and in discharging their functions\nand exercising their powers, the courts have to conform\nto that procedure. The procedure which the Tribunals have\nto follow may not always be so strictly prescribed, but the\napproach adopted by both the courts and the Tribunals\nis substantially the same, and there is no essential\ndifference between the functions that they discharge. As\nin the case of courts, so in the case of Tribunals, it is the\nState's inherent judicial power which has been transferred\nand by virtue of the said power, it is the State's inherent\njudicial function which they discharge.\"\n(emphasis supplied)\n(13.4) In Kihoto Hollohan vs. Zachillhu - 1992 Supp (2)\nSCC 651, a Constitution Bench reiterated the above position\nand added the following:\nWhere there is a lis - an affirmation by one party and\ndenial by another - and the dispute necessarily involves\na decision on the rights and obligations of the parties to it\nand the authority is called upon to decide it, there is an\nexercise of judicial power. That authority is called a\nTribunal, if it does not have all the trappings of a court‚Äù.\nH In S.P. Sampath Kumar vs. Union of India - (1987) 1 SCC\n"}
