{"pages":[{"pageNumber":21}],"text":"SHAIKH SATTAR v. STATE OF MAHARASHTRA 523\n[SURINDER SINGH NIJJAR, J.]\nIn one version, it is stated that victim was asleep when the A\nstone from the tin roof rolled over her head. It is\ninconceivable that in such cold weather, the deceased\nShaminabee was sleeping in the open. Especially since,\neven according to the husband, she was alone in the two\nroom tenement. In normal course, she would sleep in the\nwarmest part of the house, in such cold weather. That\nwould be the interior room where the dead body was lying.\nThe roof of that room was made of clay and wood.\n(vii) The opinion of Dr. Anil Digambarrao Jiturkar that\ninternal corresponding injuries are also consistent with a\nstone falling on a head, would not cause any dent in the\nprosecution version. The fact remains that the victim was\nstruck on the head with a heavy blunt object, such as a\nstone.\n23. In view of the aforesaid, we are of the considered\nopinion that the conclusions reached by the trial court as also\nby the High Court cannot be said to be either clearly illegal or\nmanifestly erroneous. We, therefore, see no reason to disturb\nthe concurrent findings of the trial court and the High Court\nholding the appellant guilty of the charged offences. In view of\nthe above, the appeal is dismissed.\nD.G.\nAppeal dismissed.\nâ€¢\nB\nC\nD\nE\n"}
