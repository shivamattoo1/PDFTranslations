THE STATE OF TRIPURA 451\n[P. SATHASIVAM, J.] Â·\nperson supposed to have been directly or indirectly\nconcerned in, or privy to, any such offence, tender a pardon\non the same condition to such person.\"\nA\nB\nC\nD\n28. The principle of tendering pardon to an accomplice is\nto unravel the truth in a grave offence so that guilt of the other\naccused persons concerned in commission of crime could be\nbrought home. The object of Section 306 of the Code of\nCriminal Procedure, 1973 (in short \"the Code\") is to allow\npardon in cases where heinous offence is alleged to have been\ncommitted by several persons so that with the aid of the\nevidence of the person granted pardon, the offence may be\nbrought home to the rest. This Section empowers the Chief\nJudicial Magistrate or a Metropolitan Magistrate to tender a\n\\ pardon to a person supposed to have been directly or indirectly\nconcerned in or privy to an offence to which the section applies,\nat any stage of the investigation or inquiry or trial of the offence\non condition of his making a full and true disclosure of the whole\nof the circumstances within his knowledge relative to the\noffence. Under Section 306 of the Code, the Magistrate of the\nFirst Class is also empowered to tender pardon to an\naccomplice at any stage of inquiry or trial but not at the stage E\nof investigation on condition of his making full and true\ndisclosure of the entire circumstances within his knowledge\nrelative to the crime. Section 307 of the Code vests the Court\nto which the commitment is made, with power to tender a\npardon to an accomplice. An accomplice who has been\ngranted pardon under Section 306 or 307 of the Code gets\nprotection from prosecution. When he is called as a witness\nfor the prosecution, he must comply with the condition of making\na full and true disclosure of the whole of the circumstances\nwithin his knowledge concerning the offence and to every other\nperson concerned, whether as principal or abettor, in the\ncommission thereof and if he suppresses anything material and\nessential within his knowledge concerning the commission of\ncrime or fails or refuses to comply with the condition on which\nthe tender was made and the Public Prosecutor gives his\nF\nG\nH\n452 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2011] 14 (ADDL.) S.C.R.\nA certificate under Section 308 of the Code to that effect, the\nprotection given to him can be lifted.\nB\n29. Section 306 (4) makes it clear that the person\naccepting a tender of pardon should be examined as a witness\nfirst in the Court of Magistrate and subsequently in the trial\nCourt. Once an accused is granted pardon under Section 306,\nhe ceases to be an accused and becomes witness for the\nprosecution. Regarding the delay in tendering pardon, it is not\nin dispute that the trial commenced on 11.03.2003 with the\nexamination of prosecution witnesses. The approver - PW-6,\nC submitted his application to become an approver on\n16.06.2004 well before the judgment which was delivered on\n19.04.2005. We have already quoted Section 307 of the Code\nwhich denotes that pardon can be tendered at any time after\ncommitment of a case but before the judgment is pronounced.\nD In view of the same, inasmuch as the approver submitted his\napplication well before the judgment was delivered, i.e., on\n19.04.2005, the contention regarding delay on the part of PW-\n6 is liable to be rejected.\nE\nF\n30. It is also not in dispute that initially, PW-6 was one of\nthe 13 accused persons charged with the offence of murder\nand in the array of accused, he was shown as (A-12).\nAccordingly, the prosecution is justified in taking the stand that\nthe approver (PW-6) was directly or indirectly concerned in or\nprivy to the offence of murder. In view of the same and in the\nlight of the language used in Section 307 of the Code, the\nCourts below are right in entertaining the evidence of PW-6 as\napprover. As regards the condition prescribed in Section 306\nof the Code that the approver must make a full and true\ndisclosure of the whole of the circumstances, let us analyze his\nG statement whether he complied with the above said\nrequirement.\n31. In his examination-in-chief, he had clearly stated that\nhe was one of the accused in the case and during investigation\nH he was arrested by the police. On completion of investigation,\nMRINAL DAS \u0026 ORS. v. THE STATE OF TRIPURA 453\n[P. SATHASIVAM, J.]\nC\nthe investigating agency submitted charge-sheet against him A\n* along with others for trial. In categorical terms, he asserted that\nhe was aware of the whole incident which led to the killing of\nTapan Chakraborty and also asserted that he was also\nconnected with and involved in his murder along with others.\nHe highlighted that on 21.08.2000, there was a public meeting B\norganized by CPI (M) party at Santinagar. The deceased,\nTapan Chakraborty and other party leaders attended the said\nmeeting. In the year 2000, there was a student agitation at Ratia\nFerry Ghat against kidnapping of three students and one\nlabourer by the extremists. On this issue, the students had\nblocked the road. The deceased, Tapan Chakraborty, being the\nlocal leader of the CPI (M) party, resisted the students in\nmaking agitation and blocking up the road. For that matter, PW-\n6 along with other accused developed a grudge in their minds\nto give Tapan Chakraborty a good lesson. On 30.08.2000, at\nD\nabout 7/8 p.m., a meeting was convened in the house of the\naccused Tapan Das (A-5). All the accused persons including\nPW-6 were present in the said meeting wherein it was decided\nto eliminate Tapan Chakraborty as he stood against the\nstudents' movement. He further highlighted that two days back,\nprior to holding of meeting on 30.08.2000, they saw posters\nhanging on the walls that a meeting of CPI (M) would be held\nat Santinagar on 31.08.2000 at 3:00 p.m where Ramakanta\nPaul (PW-10) and Tapan Chakraborty would remain present.\nTo materialize the plan chalked out in the meeting held on\n30.08.2000, 13 persons including PW-6 had spread over in\ndifferent groups in different places to eliminate Tapan\nChakraborty. Uttam Shil (A-8) was deputed on the other side\nof the river to let them informed when Tapan Chakraborty would\nbe proceeding towards Bagan Bazar on conclusion of meeting.\nRadha Kant Das (A-13), Ashim Bhattacharjee (A-2), Bikash\nDas (A-6), Mrinal Das (A-4), Shailendra Das (A-3) and PW-6\nwere waiting at Bagan Bazar. Another group of persons\nconsisting of Tapan Das (A-5), Gautam Das (A-11), Somesh\nDas (A-7), Pradip Das (A-9) were waiting in the house of Anil\nE\nF\nH\n454 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2011] 14 (ADDL.) S.C.R.\nA Das (A-1). All were keeping watch and observing the situation\ntill 4 p.m. Around 6 p.m., they were informed by Anil Das (A-1)\nthat the meeting at Santinagar had been over and the\nparticipants of the said meeting had started for the Ferry Ghat\nto cross the river. The persons assembled in the house of Anil\n8 Das (A-1) started for Ferry Ghat. On seeing them, another\ngroup including PW-6 waiting at Bagan Bazar also followed\nthem. All the aforesaid 13 persons reached Ferry Ghat around\n6.15 p.m. After reaching there, they found the boat carrying\nTapan Chakraborty, Ramakanta Paul PW-10 and 9/10 other\nC persons in the middle of the river. As soon as Tapan\nChakraborty and others got down from the boat, one of the\naccused shouted to attack him. While Tapan Chakraborty was\nwashing his feet in the river water, suddenly, PW-6 caught hold\nof him and dragged him down on the side of the river. He fell\non the ground with his back side up. At that point of time, Tapan\nDas (A-5) and Gautam Das (A-11) fired two rounds of bullet\nfrom their pistols on Tapan Chakraborty. Simultaneously, a\nbomb had exploded on the other side of the river. The witnesses\nwho were waiting in the passenger shed to escort the victim\nrushed to the place of occurrence. On seeing them, all the\nassailants fled towards south-east direction. PW-6 crossed the\nriver along with others taking the route of Ratia to conceal\nthemselves. They were advised by Tapan Das (A-5) and\nGautam Das (A-11) to keep themselves confined in their\nrespective houses. On the following day, PW-6 came to know\nfrom local news broadcasted by the All India Radio that Tapan\nChakraborty died following the gun shots.\nD\nE\nF\n32. Regarding his change of mind, PW-6 explained that\nhe became perplexed by the death of Tapan Chakraborty. He\nG further explained that out of repentance, he once made an\nattempt to commit suicide by hanging himself at his residence\nin the middle of the month of March, 2004. Thereafter, he\ndecided to divulge the whole incident leading to the killing of\nTapan Chakraborty before the Court. He also asserted that he\nhad decided to disclose the whole incident voluntarily on the\nH\nMRINAL DAS \u0026 ORS. v. THE STATE OF TRIPURA 455\n[P. SATHASIVAM, J.]\nadvise of the members of his family. He identified all the A\naccused persons in the Court by name and face.\n33. In cross-examination, PW-6 deposed that the police\narrested him in connection with this case one day after the\noccurrence. He was in police custody for eight days and,\nthereafter, on expiry of police remand, he was granted bail. He\nasserted that during his stay in police custody, he was not\ninterrogated by police. About his change of mind, in cross-\nexamination, he explained that since 31.08.2000 till mid of\nMarch, 2004, he had been running amok. During the aforesaid\nintervening period, he did not meet any people to express his\nmental agony. He also asserted that he lost his mental peace\nas the murder of Tapan Chakraborty was taken place before\nhis own eyes and he was also directly involved in his killing.\nHe denied that he deposed falsely. He also denied that he was\nprovoked by the CPI (M) party that if he turns to be an approver,\nhe would be given a suitable job.\nB\nC\nD\nE\n34. A reading of the entire evidence of PW-6 makes it clear\nthat the reason for change of his mind for tendering pardon is\nacceptable and in tune with the conditions prescribed in\nSections 306 and 307 of the Code. The trial Judge, who had\nthe liberty of noting his appearance and recorded his evidence,\nbelieved his version which was rightly accepted by the High\nCourt. On going through his entire evidence, the conditions.\nstated in Sections 306 and 307 of the Code are fully complied F\nwith and we accept his statement and concur with the decision\narrived at by the courts below.\nCorroborative evidence with regard to the statement of\nPW-6:\n35. In the FIR, the following persons have been named as\naccused relating to the occurrence, namely, Anil Das (A-1),\nAshim Bhattacharjee (A-2), Shailendra Das (A-3), Mrinal Das\n(A-4), Tapan Das (A-5), Bikash Das (A-6), Somesh Das (A-\n7), Uttam Shil (A-8), Pradip Das (A-9), Subal Deb (A-10),\nG\nH\n458 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2011] 14 (ADDL.) S:C.R.\nA accused persons were the supporters of Congress (I) party. He\nalso clarified that two of the miscreants were supporters of\nAmara Bengali Party.\nB\nC\nD\n(a) Babul Dey was examined as PW-1: In his evidence,\nhe narrated the entire events commencing from conspiracy\nending with gunshot on the deceased - Tapan Chakraborty.\nThough it was pointed out that he had not stated all the\nabovementioned details in the complaint, on going through the\nsame, we are satisfied that all relevant details have been stated\nin the complaint and the omission to mention is only negligible.\nLikewise, it was commended by the counsel for the appellants\nthat though there were some police personnel in the police\nmobile van, PW-1 did not disclose the incident to any of those\npolice officials traveling in the said vehicle. For this, PW-1 has\nexplained that they took the injured to Kalyanpur Hospital first\nand later on, in association with his party supporters, he lodged\na complaint. In such a situation, it is but natural that the person\nwho received gunshot injury has to be admitted in the hospital\nand only thereafter anybody could think of the next step including\nmaking a complaint to the police. We are satisfied that there\nE is no infirmity in the conduct of PW-1 in not conveying anything\nto the police personnel in the mobile van and even his\ninteraction with his party colleagues. PW-1 has also admitted\nthat Tapan Chakraborty was the Secretary of DYFI, because\nof which it was argued that due to political rivalry, he had falsely\nF implicated the accused persons. In view of the above\ndiscussion, we are not impressed upon such objection and\nreject the same.\nG\nH\n(b) The other eye-witness is Nitai Das (PW-3), who was\nin the boat. It was he, who identified Ratan Sukladas (A-12),\nRadha Kant Das (A-13) and Bikash Das (A-6) as the members\nof attacking group. He also admitted that the deceased Tapan\nChakraborty was known to him. Like PW-1, he also explained\nthat the meeting was held at Santinagar between 3:00 p.m. to\n5:45 p.m. He along with Tapan Chakraborty and others reached\nMRINAL DAS \u0026 ORS. v. THE STATE OF TRIPURA 459\n[P. SATHASIVAM, J.]\nB\nSantinagar through Ferry Ghat. They crossed the river by boat A\nand got down on the other side of the river and in that process,\naccording to him, he heard sound of gunshot and\nsimultaneously a bomb was hurled from the other side of the\nriver. Due to fear, they fled at a distance of 10 cubics from the\nplace of occurrence and some people who were waiting in the\npassenger shed rushed to the spot. When he along with others\nreturned to the place of occurrence, he found Tapan\nChakbraborty lying on the ground in injured condition. Apart\nfrom three persons mentioned above, he also stated that about\n10/12 persons attacked Tapan Chakraborty.. The miscreants,\nafter commission of offence, fled towards south-east direction.\nThereafter, they took him to Kalyanpur Hospital in a police van.\nHe was examined by the I.O. on the same night, that is, at about\n9.00 p.m., to whom also he disclosed the names of the above\nsaid accused persons. There is no contradiction with regard\nto the identification of the said three assailants. Though counsel\nfor the appellants has pointed out certain omissions, on going\nthrough the same, we are satisfied that these omissions were\nnot at all material and the High Court has rightly relied on and\naccepted his evidence.\nC\nD\nE\nà¸.\n(c) Apart from eye-witnesses PW-1 and PW-3, another\neye-witness Benu Ranjan Dhupi (PW-11) was also present in\nthe boat. According to him, on the fateful day, that is, on\n31.08.2000 around 3.00 p.m., he met Tapan Chakraborty at\nBagan Bazar who requested him to go to Santinagar well F\nahead in connection with peace meeting to be held there and\nto supervise and see that everything was in order. According\nto him, as directed by Tapan Chakraborty, he reached\nSantinagar at 3:00 p.m. He mentioned that Uttam Shil (A-8)\nenquired from him whether Tapan Chakraborty would attend the G\nmeeting. After concluding the meeting, Tapan Chakraborty and\nothers including PW-11 got into the boat to cross the river.\nWhile he was getting down from the boat, he heard hue and\ncry and some one saying \"attack them attack them\". He also\nheard a sound of explosion of bomb on the other side of the H\n460 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2011] 14 (ADDL.) S.C.R.\nA river and the sound of two rounds of fire. Thereafter, he fled\nfrom the spot due to fear. According to him, after 10 days of\nthe aforesaid occurrence, he met Ramakanta Paul (PW-10) at\nBagan Bazar. His evidence shows that he was also in the boat,\nhowever, he only mentioned that accused Uttam Shil (A-8) was\nB found near the venue of the meeting and he narrated about the\nenquiry made by him whether Tapan Chakraborty would attend\nthe meeting. Even, according to him, the said Uttam Shil (A-8)\nhad disappeared from the place of meeting.\nC\nD\n(d) The other three persons in the boat were Ganesh Kol\n(PW-2), Ramakanta Paul (PW-10), and Prabir Biswas (PW-\n12). No doubt, all the three witnesses turned hostile since they\nrefused to identify the assailants before the Court at the instance\nof the prosecution. However, as rightly observed by the High\nCourt, they testified to the other parts of the occurrence\nsupporting the prosecution case that on the said date and time,\na group of miscreants had done to death the victim Tapan\nChakraborty. Though, their evidence may not be fully\nsupportable to the prosecution case, however, as observed by\nthe High Court, it is clear from their statements that they\nE accompanied the deceased in the same boat and\ncorroborated with other witnesses with regard to the factum of\nmurder though they did not identify the persons concerned. It\nis settled position of law that the evidence of hostile witnesses\nneed not be rejected in its entirety but may be relied on for\nF corroboration.\nG\nH\nEye-witnesses in the passenger shed\n40. Now, let us discuss the eye-witnesses who were\npresent in the passenger shed.\n(a) The four eye-witnesses, namely, Nehar Ranjan Deb\n(PW-4), Bidhu Urang (PW-7), Pranab Chakraborty (PW-8) and\nSatyendra Tanti (PW-9) were waiting in the passenger shed on\nthe opposite bank of the river and when the assailants had\nattacked the victim all of a sudden, they rushed to the spot. In\nMRINAL DAS \u0026 ORS. v. THE STATE OF TRIPURA 461\n[P. SATHASIVAM, J.]\nD\nhis evidence, Nehar Ranjan Deb (PW-4) admitted that Tapan A\nChakraborty was known to him and he was his maternal uncle.\nHe was the Vice-Chairman of Kalyanpur Panchayat Society.\nOn 31.08.2000, in the evening, at around 06:30 p.m., he went-\nto a tea stall at Bagan Bazar and found Pranab Chakraborty\n(PW-8), younger brother of Tapan Chakraborty. Pranab B\nChakraborty told him that Tapan had gone to Santinagar to\nattend a meeting. He requested him to accompany him to Ferry\nGhat for escorting Tapan Chakraborty as he was running a risk\nof his life because of some untoward incident which took place\nin his house. Satyendra Tanti (PW-9) and Bidhu Urang (PW-7) C\nalso accompanied them. He further explained that they reached\nFerry Ghat at around 05:45 p.m. and took shelter in the\npassenger shed as, at that time, it was drizzling. According to\nhim, while they were waiting in the passenger shed, he had\nnoticed Anil Das (A-1) proceeding hurriedly towards Bagan\nBazar from the side of Ferry Ghat. After 5/7 minutes, he had\nseen about 10 youths proceeding towards Ferry Ghat from the\ndirection of Bagan Bazar. He mentioned the name of four\npersons, namely, Gautam Das (A-11), Pradip Das (A-9), Tapan\nDas (A-5) and Mrinal Das (A-4) who were among the youths.\nThose persons were waiting in the Ferry Ghat. The distance of\nFerry Ghat from passenger shed would be 100 cubics. He\nnoticed Tapan Chakraborty and others getting down from the\nboat and as soon as they got down, the miscreants dragged\nTapan Chakraborty. All the persons in the passenger shed\nproceeded towards Ferry Ghat, at that time, they also heard\nthe sound of bursting of bomb as well as sound of gun fire. They\nbecame frightened and retreated for a while, thereafter, they\nproceeded towards Ferry Ghat. After reaching there, they found\nTapan Chakraborty lying on the ground with injuries. They lifted\nhim and brought him on the main road and with the help of a G\nPolice Mobile Van they took him to Kalyanpur Hospital.\nHowever, he admitted that he did not accompany them. He\nasserted that after the commission of offence the miscreants\nfled towards south. In cross-examination, he admitted that the\ndeceased was forefront leader of the CPI (M) party. He denied\nE\nF\nH\n462 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2011] 14 (ADDL.) S.C.R.\nA the suggestion that the murder of Tapan Chakraborty was the\nresult of inter-Party rivalry.\nB\nC\n(b) Next witness who was present in the passenger shed\nwas Bidhu Urang, examined as PW-7. In his examination-in-\nchief, he stated that Tapan Chakraborty was murdered on\n31.08.2000 by some miscreants belonging to UBLF extremists\ngroup. He was killed at Santinagar Ferry Ghat at around 06:30\np.m. and according to him at the time of occurrence, he was\nsitting in the passenger shed which is about 100 cubics away\nfrom the place of occurrence. He also mentioned that besides\nhim Pranab Chakraborty (PW-8), Nahar Ranjan Deb (PW-4),\nSatyendra Tanti (PW-9) were also present there. He also\nadmitted that at that time it was drizzling. In order to protect\nthemselves from the rain, they took shelter in the passenger\nshed at around 05:30 p.m. He also stated in the examination-\nD in-chief about the meeting at Santinagar and explained that the\ndeceased Tapan Chakraborty went to Santinagar to attend that\npeace meeting organized by DYFI. He further explained that he\nalong with others went to Santinagar to escort 'Tapan\nChakraborty. Like, PW-4, he also narrated that while he was\nE sitting in the passenger shed, he saw a group of 12/14 persons\nproceeding towards Santinagar Ferry Ghat, out of which, he\nrecognized Tapan Das (A-5), Gautam Das (A-11), Pradip Das\n(A-9) and Somesh Das (A-7). At about 06:30 p.m., according\nto him, he noticed that Tapan Chakraborty accompanied by\nF about 15 persons crossing the river in a boat. One Ramakant\nPaul (PW-10) was one of the 15 persons who accompanied\nTapan Chakraborty. Suddenly, he heard the sound of two gun\nshots and immediately when he looked forward, he saw a group\nof persons running away towards south-east direction. At once,\nG he alongwith his companions rushed to Ferry Ghat and found\nTapan Chakraborty in injured condition. They carried him upto\nmain road and then they took him in a polic? mobile van. He\nasserted that the group of persons who were found running\naway from the Ferry Ghat was the same whom he saw earlier\nH proceeding towards Ferry Ghat from Bagan Bazar. He informed\n"}
