Public servant to vacate office if directed by\nLokayukta etc. (1) Where after investigation into a\ncomplaint the Lokayukta or an Upalokayukta is satisfied\nthat the complaint involving an allegation against the public\nservant is substantiated and that the public servant\nconcerned should not continue to hold the post held by him,\nthe Lokayukta or the Upalokayukta shall make a\ndeclaration to that effect in his report under sub-section (3)\nof section 12. Where the competent authority is the\nGovernor, State Government or the Chief Minister, it may\neither accept or reject the declaration.

The provisions discussed above clearly indicate that\nthe functions to be discharged by Lokayukta or Upa Lokayukta\nare investigative in nature and the report of Lokayukta or Upa\nLokayukta under sub-sections (1) and (3) of Section 12 and the\nSpecial Report submitted under sub-section (5) of Section 12\nare only recommendatory. No civil consequence as such follows\nfrom the action of Lokayukta and Upa Lokayukta, though they\ncan initiate prosecution before a competent court. I have\nextensively referred to the object and purpose of the Act and\nexplained the various provisions of the Act only to indicate the\nnature and functions to be discharged by Lokayukta or Upa\nLokayukta under the Act.\n26. The Act has, therefore, clearly delineated which are the\nD matters to be investigated by the Lokayukta and Upa\nLokayukta. They have no authority to investigate on a complaint\ninvolving a grievance in respect of any action specified in the\nSecond Schedule of the Act, which are as follows:\nE\nLL\nF\nG\nH\n(a) Action taken for the purpose of powers investigating\ncrimes relating to the security of the State.\n(b) Action taken in the exercise of powers in relation\nto determining whether a matter shall go to a Court\nor not.\n(c)\n(d)\nAction taken in matters which arise out of the terms\nof a contract governing purely commercial relations\nof the administration with customers or suppliers,\nexcept where the complaint alleges harassment or\ngross delay in meeting contractual obligations.\nAction taken in respect of appointments, removals,\npay, discipline, superannuation or other matters\nrelating to conditions of service of public servants\nbut not including action relating to claims for\nJUSTICE CHANDRASHEKARAIAH (RETD.) v.\nJANEKERE C. KRISHNA [K.S. RADHAKRISHNAN, J.]\n1025\npension, gratuity, provident fund or to any claims A\nwhich arise on retirement, removal or termination\nof service.\n(e) Grant of honours and awards.\n27. Further if the complainant has or had any remedy by\nway of appeal, revision, review or other proceedings before any.\ntribunal, court officer or other authority and has not availed of\nthe same, the Lokayukta and Upa Lokayukta shall not conduct\nany investigation under the Act, in other words, they have to act\nwithin the four corners of the Act.\n28. The Act has also been enacted to make provision for\nmaking enquiries by the Lokayukta and Upa Lokayukta into the\nadministrative action relatable to matters specified in List II or\nList III of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution, taken by or\non behalf of the Government of Karnataka or certain public\nauthorities in the State of Karnataka, including any omission\nor commission in connection with or arising out of such action\netc.\n29. Lokayukta or Upa Lokayukta under the Act are\nestablished to investigate and report on allegations or\ngrievances relating to the conduct of public servants which\nincludes the Chief Minister; all other Minister and members of\nthe State Legislature; all officers of the State Government;\nChairman, Vice Chairman of Local Authorities, Corporations,\nowned or controlled by the State Government, a company in\nwhich not less than fifty one per cent of the shares are held by\nthe State Government, Societies registered under the Societies\nRegistration Act, Co-operative Societies and Universities\nestablished by or under any law of the Legislature.\n30. Lokayukta and Upa Lokayukta while exercising powers\nunder the Act, of course, is acting as a quasi judicial authority\nbut it functions are investigative in nature. The Constitution\nBench of this Court in Nagendra Nath Bora and Another v.\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n1026 SUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2013] 3 S.C.R.\nA Commissioner of Hills Division and Appeals. Assam and\nOthers AIR 1958 SC 398 held whether or not an administrative\nbody or authority functions as purely administrative one or in a\nquasi-judicial capacity, must be determined in each case, on\nan examination of the relevant statute and rules framed\nB thereunder. This Court in Indian National Congress (I) v.\nInstitute of social Welfare and Others (2002) 5 SCC 685, while\ndealing with the powers of the Election Commission of India\nunder the Representation of the People Act, 1951 held that while\nexercising power under Section 29-A, the Commission acts\nC quasi-judicially and passes quasi judicial orders.\nD\n31. The Court held that what distinguishes an administrative\nact from a quasi-judicial act is, in the case of quasi-judicial\nfunctions, under the relevant law, the statutory authority is\nrequired to act judicially. In other words, where law requires that\nan authority before arriving at a decision must make an enquiry,\nsuch a requirement of law makes the authority a quasi-judicial\nauthority. Noticing the above legal principles this Court held in\nview of the requirement of law that the Commission is to give\ndecision only after making an enquiry, wherein an opportunity\nE of hearing is to be given to the representative of the political\nparty, the Election Commission is is required to act judicially.\nF\nG\nH\n32. Recently, in Automotive Tyre Manufactures\nAssociation v. Designated Authority and Others (2011) 2 SCC\n258, this Court examined the question whether the Designated\nAuthority appointed by the Central Government under Rule 3\nof the Customs Tariff (Identification, Assessment and Collection\nof Anti-Dumping Duty on dumped Articles and for Determination\nof Injury) Rules, 1995 (1995 Rules) for conducting investigation,\nfor the purpose of levy of anti dumping duty in terms of Section\n9-A of the Customs Act, 1962, is functioning as an\nadministrative or quasi judicial authority. The Court after\nexamining the scheme of the Tariff Act read with 1995 Rules\nand the nature of functions to be discharged by the Designated\nAuthority took the view that the authority exercising quasi-judicial\n"}
