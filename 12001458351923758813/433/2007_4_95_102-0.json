Collector issued a draft\nstatement under Section 10. Deputy Collector, Land Reforms, in 1976\nrecorded a finding that the landholder did not possess surplus land and the\nproceedings were required to be dropped. No 'final statement' as required\nunder Section 11 was issued or published by the Authority. No appeal was G\nfiled against the order of the Deputy Collector. In 1981, the Act was amended\ninter alia permitting initiation of fresh proceedings in certain cases. One\n'H' thereafter moved an application for intiation of fresh proceedings against\nthe landholder in respect of the return of 1973-74, on the ground that the\n95\nH\n96\n96\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 4 S.C.R.\nA landholder had not disclosed full and correct facts in the return and in fact\nthe landholder possessed more lands than prescribed under the Ceiling Act.\nFresh proceedings were initiated in 1993 and it was held that the landholder\npossessed surplus land and direction was given to take appropriate steps for\nissuance of final statement under Section 11. The appeal thereagainst was\ndismissed by the Collector holding that the landholder was in possession of\nexcess land. The Revision Petition was also dismissed by Board of Revenue.\nAppellant-landholder filed Writ Petition Single Judge of the High Court held\nthat initiation of fresh proceedings were permissible as no final notification\nunder Section 11 was issued prior to 1981 amendment. Division Bench of\nHigh Court confirmed the decision of Single Judge. Hence the present appeal.\nB\nC\nPartly allowing the appeal, the Court\nHELD: 1.1. Final statement under Section 11(1) of Bihar Land Reforms\n(Fixation of Ceiling Area and Acquisition of Surplus Land) Act, 1961 ought\nto have been issued immediately or in any case within ‘reasonable time'. The\nD authority cannot neglect to do that which the law mandates and requires doing.\nBy to issuing consequential final statement under Section 11(1) of the Act,\nauthority had failed to discharge its statutory duty. Therefore, such default\nin discharge of statutory duty by the respondents under the Act cannot\nprejudice the appellant. [Para 10] [100-E-F]\nE\nF\n1.2. The power under Section 32B of the Act to initiate fresh\nproceedings could not have been exercised. Admittedly, Section 32B came on\nthe statute book by Bihar Act 55 of 1982. The case of the appellant was over\nmuch prior to the amendment of the Act and insertion of Section 32B.\nTherefore, the authorities cannot be allowed to take undue advantage of its\nown default in failure to act in accordance with law and initiate fresh\nproceedings. [Para 11] [100-G-H; 101-A]\n1.3. A man cannot be permitted to take undue and unfair advantage of\nhis own wrong to gain favourable interpretation of law. It is sound principle\nthat he who prevents a thing from being done shall not avail himself of the\nG non-performance he has occasioned. “A wrong doer ought not be permitted\nto make a profit our of his own wrong”.

In the application filed by ‘H', the allegation was that the landholder\nhad played fraud upon the authorities and on the statute by not furnishing\ntrue and full facts as to the land possessed by him. If it is so, irrespective of\nstatutory provisions, an appropriate action can be taken. Though the question\nwas raised before the statutory authorities under the Act, the High Court B\nhad decided the case only on the basis only on the basis of Section 32B of the\nAct which could not have been done. Since Section 32B is not applicable to\nthe case on hand, it is appropriate to remit the matter to the Division Bench\nof the High Court to decide it afresh under the law as it stood prior to\namendment by Bihar Act 55 of 1982. At the same time, however, the High\nCourt will consider the case as to whether all requisite facts had been\ndisclosed by the landholder when he filed return in 1973-74 or there was\nnon-disclosure of certain lands. [Para 15] [102-A-B-C]\nCIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 7351 of 2000.\nC\nᎠ\nFrom the Final Judgment and Order dated 13.08.1999 of the High Court\nof Judicature at Patna in L.P.A. No. 1117 of 1998.\nK.B. Sinha, Bharat Sangal, R.R. Kumar and Samyadip Chatterji for the\nAppellant.\nMohit Sah, Rituraj Biswas and Gopal for the Respondents.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nE\nC.K. THAKKER, J. 1. The present appeal is filed by the appellant\nagainst the judgment and order passed by the Division Bench of the High F\nCourt of Patna on August 13, 1989 by which it dismissed the Letters Patent\nAppeal No. 1177 of 1998 and confirmed the order passed by a Single Judge\non September 24, 1998 in Civil Writ Jurisdiction Case No. 3008 of 1998.\n2. Brief facts of the case leading to the present appeal are that a return\nwas filed by the landholder under the Bihar Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling G\nArea and Acquisition of Surplus Land) Act, 1961 (hereinafter referred to as\n'the Act'). It was alleged that the landholder possessed excess land. A draft\nstatement under Section 10 was issued by the Collector under the Act. The\nlandholder objected to the proceedings and asserted that he did not possess\nland in excess of ceiling area. An enquiry was made and verification reports\nH\ni\nB\n98\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 4 S.C.R.\nA were submitted by the Circle Officers (Anchal Adhikaris). The Deputy Collector,\nLand Reforms, (DCLR) Samastipur, vide his order dated January 07, 1976\nupheld the objection of the landholder and recorded a finding that the\nlandholder did not possess surplus land and the proceedings were required\nto be dropped. The case was accordingly disposed of. No appeal was filed\nagainst the said decision and it had become final. No ‘final statement', as\nrequired under Section 11 of the Act, however, was issued or published by\nthe authority. The Act was amended in April, 1981 (Bihar Act 55 of 1982) and\nafter Section 32, Sections 32A and 32B came to be inserted. Whereas Section\n32A provided for abatement of appeal, revision, review and reference, Section\n32B permitted initiation of fresh proceedings in certain cases. In the present\nC case, as already noted earlier, no final statement under Section 11 was issued.\nIt appears that one Hridya Narayan Yadav, Secretary, Kisan Sabha Darbhanga-\ncum-Member, Darbhanga District Committee, Bhartiya Communist Party\n(Marxist), Darbhanga moved an application in the Court of Additional Collector,\nLand Ceiling, Darbhanga along with an affidavit alleging therein that the\nlandholder had more lands than prescribed under the Ceiling Act, but correct\nfacts were not disclosed when the return was filed under the Act by the\nlandholder in 1973-74. Fresh proceedings were, therefore, initiated in the year\n1993 in Land Ceiling Case No. 65 of 1992-93 and statement of landholder was\nrecorded. The Additional Collector, after considering the objection of the\nlandholder and referring to details furnished by Circle Officers held that the\nE landholder possessed 96.40 acres of land. He was entitled to only one unit.\nD\nF\nThus, he could retain only 25 acres of Category III land and the remaining.\nland of 71.40 acres was required to be declared surplus. An order was passed\nto that effect. A direction was also given to take appropriate steps for\nissuance of final statement under Section 11 of the Act.\n3. The appellant preferred an appeal against the said order before the\nCollector under Section 30 of the Act. It was, inter alia, contended that the\norder dated January 7, 1976 declaring that the landholder did not possess\nexcess land, had not been challenged and attained finality. The notification\nand final statement which was required to be issued under Section 11 of the\nAct had not been issued by the authorities. Non-issuance of final statement\nG\ncannot adversely affect the landholder. It was also submitted that the Ceiling\ncase was of 1973-1974. It was over in 1976 and it cannot now be reopened.\nIt was also urged that Section 32B came to be inserted only in 1981, but before\nthat final order was passed in 1976. No fresh proceedings thus could be\ninitiated under the Amendment Act of 1982. It was, therefore, submitted that\nH the order passed by the District Collector was liable to be set aside.\nT\nKUSHESHWAR PRASAD SINGH v. STATE OF BIHAR [C.K. THAKKER, J.] 99\n4. The Collector, however, by an order dated June 2, 1997 dismissed the A\n☐ appeal and confirmed the order passed by the Additional Collector, Darbhanga\nand observed that the landholder was in possession of excess land. The\nlandholder approached the Board of Revenue by filing a Revision Petition\nunder Section 32 of the Act which was also dismissed by the Member, Board\nof Revenue, Bihar vide his order dated January 13, 1998.\nB\n5. The aggrieved landholder then instituted a writ petition before the\nHigh Court of Patna. A counter affidavit was filed on behalf of the respondent-\nState in which a stand was taken that Land Ceiling Case No. 65 of 1992-93\nwas in fact renumbered of the old case and proceedings were started afresh\nin exercise of power under Section 32B of the Act and such a course was C\npermissible in the light of the fact that after the order was passed on January\n7, 1976, no final statement was issued under Section 11 of the Act. Initiation\nof fresh proceedings was, therefore, permissible and the order passed by the\nAdditional Collector, Darbhanga and Collector, Darbhanga could not be said\nto be unlawful.\n6. The learned Single Judge noted that though the order was passed in\n1976, no final notification under Section 11(1) of the Act was issued prior to\nApril 9, 1981 when the Act was amended and Sections 32A and 32B were\nadded. In the circumstances, observed the learned Single Judge, initiation of\nfresh proceedings was permissible and the order passed in those proceedings\ncould not be objected. The writ petition was, therefore, dismissed. The Division\nBench in Letters Patent Appeal confirmed the order of the learned Single\nJudge. The said order has been challenged in this Court.\n7. On February 4, 2000, notice was issued by this Court and ad-interim\nrelief was granted. The matter was thereafter adjourned from time to time. On\nDecember 11, 2000, leave was granted. The matter has now been placed before\nus for final hearing.\nD\nE\nF\n8. The learned counsel for the appellant contended that the proceedings\nhad been concluded and final order was passed under the Act as early as on\nJanuary 7, 1976 and that order had become final. Nobody had challenged it. G\nLegality of that order could not be subsequently considered by initiating\nfresh proceedings. It was incumbent on the authority to take consequential\naction of issuance of final statement under sub-section (1) of Section 11 of\nthe Act immediately after the order was passed, but it was not done. There\nwas thus failure to discharge statutory duty by the authorities which cannot\nH\n100\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 4 S.C.R.\nA adversely or prejudicially affect the interest of the landholder. It was also\nsubmitted that there was no question of application of Section 32B of the Act\nwhich was added only in April, 1981. Fresh proceedings initiated in 1992-93,\ntherefore, were without jurisdiction and all actions taken in those proceedings\nare liable to be set aside. It was further submitted that it was due to mala fide\nact by Hridya Narain Yadav that proceedings were started in 1992-93.\nAccording to the learned counsel, neither the authorities nor the High Court\nconsidered the provisions of law and the orders are contrary to law.\nB\n9. The learned counsel for the respondent-authorities supported the\norders and submitted that they were right in holding that since no final\nC notification under Section 11(1) was issued, the proceedings could not be\nE\nsaid to have been concluded and in view of amendment in 1981, action could\nbe taken under Section 32B of the Act and appellant had no right to make\ngrievance against it.\n10. Having considered the rival submissions of the learned counsel for\nD the parties, in our opinion, the appeal deserves to be partly allowed. So far\nas the contention of the appellant that the proceedings had been initiated in\n1973-74 and final order was passed on January 7, 1976 is not disputed and\ncannot be disputed. If it is so, submission of the appellant is well founded\nthat final statement as required by sub-section (1) of Section 11 ought to have\nbeen issued and effect ought to have been given to the final order. Admittedly,\nno appeal was filed. Nor the order was challenged by any party. The appellant\nis right in contending that final statement ought to have been issued\nimmediately or in any case within ‘reasonable time'. The authority cannot\nneglect to do that which the law mandates and requires doing. By not issuing\nconsequential final statement under Section 11(1) of the Act, the authority\nF had failed to discharge its statutory duty. Obviously, therefore, the appellant\nis justified in urging that such default in discharge of statutory duty by the\nrespondents under the Act cannot prejudice him. To that extent, therefore, the\ngrievance of the appellant is well-founded.\n11. The appellant is also right in contending before this Court that the\nG power under Section 32B of the Act to initiate fresh proceedings could not\nhave been exercised. Admittedly, Section 32B came on the statute book by\nBihar Act 55 of 1982. The case of the appellant was over much prior to the\namendment of the Act and insertion of Section 32B. The appellant, therefore,\nis right in contending that the authorities cannot be allowed to take undue\nadvantage of its own default in failure to act in accordance with law and\nH\n+\n+\nKUSHESHWAR PRASAD SINGH v. STATE OF BIHAR [C.K. THAKKER, J.] 101\ninitiate fresh proceedings.\nA\n12. In this connection, our attention has been invited by the learned\ncounsel for the appellant to a decision of this Court in Mrutunjay Pani \u0026 Anr.\nv. Narmada Bala Sasmal \u0026 Anr., AIR (1961) SC 1353, wherein it was held by\nthis Court that where an obligation is cast on a party and he commits a breach\nof such obligation, he cannot be permitted to take advantage of such situation. B\nThis is based on the Latin maxim 'Commodum ex injuria sua nemo habere\ndebet (No party can take undue advantage of his own wrong).\nC\n13. In Union of India \u0026 Ors. v. Major General Madan Lal Yadav\n(Retd.), [1996] 4 SCC 127, the accused-army personnel himself was responsible\nfor delay as he escaped from detention. Then he raised an objection against\ninitiation of proceedings on the ground that such proceedings ought to have\nbeen initiated within six months under the Army Act, 1950. Referring to the\nabove maxim, this Court held that the accused could not take undue advantage\nof his own wrong. Considering the relevant provisions of the Act, the Court\nheld that presence of the accused was an essential condition for the D\ncommencement of trial and when the accused did not make himself available,\nhe could not be allowed to raise a contention that proceedings were time-\nbarred. This Court referred to Broom's Legal Maxims (10th Edn.) p. 191\nwherein it was stated;\n\"...it is a maxim of law, recognised and established, that no man E\nshall take advantage of his own wrong; and this maxim, which is\nbased on elementary principles, is fully recognised in Courts of law\nnd of equity, and, indeed, admits of illustration from every branch of\nlegal procedure\".\n14. It is settled principle of law that a man cannot be permitted to take F\nundue and unfair advantage of his own wrong to gain favourable interpretation\nof law. It is sound principle that he who prevents a thing from being done\nshall not avail himself of the non-performance he has occasioned. To put it\ndifferently, \"a wrong doer ought not to be permitted to make a profit out of\nhis own wrong\".\nG\n15. In view of the findings recorded by us hereinabove, we would have\nallowed the appeal in its entirety and would have quashed the proceedings\ninitiated in 1992-93 by setting aside all orders passed in such proceedings.\nIt, however, appears that an application was made by Hridya Narain Yadav,\nin which it was stated that the landholder had not disclosed full and correct H\n102\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 4 S.C.R.\nA facts in his return. Certain lands belonged to him and located in District of\nDarbhanga were not shown in the earlier proceedings. In other words, the\nI allegation was that the landholder had played fraud upon the authorities and\non the statute by not furnishing true and full facts as to the land possessed\nby him. If it is so, irrespective of statutory provisions, an appropriate action\ncan be taken. Though the question was raised before the statutory authorities\nunder the Act, the High Court (learned Single Judge as also the Division\nBench) had decided the case only on the basis of Section 32B of the Act\nwhich could not have been done. In view of our findings as to non-applicability\nof Section 32B to the case on hand, we consider it appropriate to remit the\nmatter to the Division Bench of the High Court to decide it afresh under the\nC law as it stood prior to amendment by Bihar Act 55 of 1982. At the same time,\nB\nhowever, the High Court will consider the case as to whether all requisite facts\nhad been disclosed by the landholder when he filed return in 1973-74 or there\nwas non-disclosure of certain lands. The Division Bench of the High Court\nwill finally decide the matter after affording opportunity to all the parties. Let\nsuch a decision be taken as expeditiously as possible, preferably within six\nD\nmonths from the receipt of the order of this Court.\n16. For the foregoing reasons, the appeal is partly allowed to the extent\nindicated hereinabove. The matter is remitted to the High Court to decide it\nafresh in accordance with law. In the facts and circumstances of the case,\nthere shall be no order as to costs.\nE\nK.K.T.\nAppeal allowed.\nt\n"}
