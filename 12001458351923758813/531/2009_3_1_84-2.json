The applicant\ndid not seek extension of hotel building to survey\nNo.246/2 apparently because of the express\nembargo contained in Clause 4(viii) of the\nagreement that the company shall never construct\nany building or structure in the acquired land.\n(xvi) The aforementioned application was considered by\nFOMENTO RESORTS AND HOTELS LTD. AND ANR. v. 25\nMINGUEL MARTINS AND ORS. [G.S. SINGHVI, J.]\nthe EEC in its 23rd meeting held on 11.6.1987 and A\nwas favourably recommended subject to the\ncondition that pedestrian path along the beach may\nbe made available by constructing an access from\nthe jetty so that public can reach the beach during\nthe high tide period. Thereafter, the matter was B\nconsidered in the meeting of the EDC held on\n11.9.1987 and it was decided to accept the\nrecommendations of the EEC, subject to the\ncondition regarding pedestrian path. The decision\nof the EDC was communicated to Smt. Anju Timblo\nby the Chief Town Planner vide his letter dated\n14.10.1987, the relevant portion of which read as\nunder:\nC\nD\n\"In continuation of this office letter No. DE/4757(DZ/\n2009)3055/87 dated 10.7.87, it is to inform that the project\nwas discussed in the 10th meeting of the Eco Development\nCouncil held on 11.9.87 and the Council has cleared the\nproject as per the plans submitted by you with condition\nthat pedestrian path be made available by construction\nan access from the jetty so that the public can reach the E\nbeach even during high tide.\"\n(xvii) In furtherance of the decision taken by the EDC, the\nDevelopment Authority issued an order under\nSection 44(3)(c) read with Section 49(2) of the\nF\nTown and Country Planning Act whereby permission\nwas granted to appellant No.1 for extension of the\nexisting hotel building. The opening paragraph and\nClause 10 of the conditions incorporated in that\norder, read as under:\nG\n\"Whereas an application has been made by Shri/Smt.

And whereas, a development charge affixed at\nRs.84,170/- has been paid by him/her.\nTherefore, under the powers vested in this Authority under\nSection 44(3)(c) / 49(2) of the Goa, Daman \u0026 Diu Town \u0026\nCountry Planning Act, 1974, the above said applicant is\ngranted development permission to carry out development\nin accordance with the enclosed plans subject to the\nfollowing conditions:-\nCODE\nD\nE\nF\n0\nH\n10) The Pedestrian path has to be made available\nby constructing an access from the jetty so that the\npublic can reach the beach even during high tide.\"\n(xviii) After some time another application was made on\nbehalf of appellant No.1 under Section 46 read with\nSection 44 of the Town and Country Planning Act\nfor renewal of the permission granted vide order\ndated 15.4.1988 with a deviation in respect of plots\nbearing survey Nos. 246/1, 2, 3 and 4. Thus, for the\nfirst time, a request was made for raising\nconstruction in survey No. 803 (new No.246/2) in the\ngarb of making deviation from the permission\nalready granted. This application was not put up\neither before the EEC or EDC and was\nstraightaway considered by the Goa Town and\nCountry Planning Board (for short 'the Board') in its\nmeeting held on 20.6.1991 as an additional item\nand the following decision was taken:-\n\"The proposal relating to extension/deviation of Hotel\nCidade de Goa which also involves relaxation in number\nFOMENTO RESORTS AND HOTELS LTD.

SINGHVI, J.]\nof floors was considered and approved subject to the A\ncondition that the height shall not exceed the stipulated limit\nof 17.5 mts. which was applicable at the time when the\nproject was approved\".\n(xix) The above reproduced decision of the Board was\nforwarded by the State Government to the\nDevelopment Authority. However, without even\nwaiting for consideration by the competent body,\nappellant No.1 appears to have started construction\nby deviating from the approved plan. This\ncompelled the Chairman of the Development\nAuthority to send letter dated 12.7.1991 to appellant\nNo.1 requiring it to refrain from going ahead with\nfurther construction.\nB\nC\n(xx)\n(XX) \nIt is not borne out from the record that matter D\nrelating to extension of the hotel building on plot\nbearing survey No.803 (new No.246/2) was ever\nplaced before the EDC, but the Development\nAuthority suo moto passed order dated 20.4.1992\nvide which permission was granted to appellant E\nNo.1 to carry out the development on plot bearing\nsurvey No.246/1, 2, 3 and 4 subject to the terms and\nconditions specified therein, including the following:\n\"The condition No.10 of the Order No.PDA/T/7471/297/88\ndated 15.4.1988 should be strictly adhered to.\"\nF\n(xxi) When appellant No.1 started extension of the hotel\nbuilding in violation of the permission accorded by\nthe EDC, Shri Minguel Martins, who claims to have\npurchased plots carved out of survey No.792 (new G\nNo.242/1), popularly known as 'Machado's Cove',\nfiled Writ Petition No.330/1991, for issue of a\ndirection to the State Government, Village\nPanchayat Taleigao and other official respondents\nto remove the illegal construction made by appellant H\n4\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\n☐ G\nH\n88\n28\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2009] 3 S.C.R.\nNo.1, to refrain from granting any permission for\nconstruction or regularizing the construction already\nmade by appellant No.1 and also revoke the\npermission granted vide order dated 15.4.1988. He\nfurther prayed for issue of a direction to respondent\nNos.1 and 2 in the writ petition (appellants herein)\nto keep the traditional access to the beach open\nand not to put up any further construction on plots\nbearing survey Nos.787 and 803, which would\ninterfere with the public road, parking lot and public\naccess to the beach. In paragraph 3 of his petition,\nShri Minguel Martins made a mention of the\nalleged violation of the conditions contained in\nletters dated 1.8.1978 and 22.8.1978 issued by the\nChief Town Planner and Sarpanch of the Gram\nPanchayat respectively by asserting that\nrespondent Nos.1 and 2 (appellants herein) have\nclosed the road and footpath to the beach and\ncommenced construction of the parking, which he\nhas been challenged in Writ Petition No.284/1991.\nIn paragraphs 5 to 7, he referred to agreement\ndated 26.10.1983, and alleged that in complete\nviolation of the mandate thereof, respondent Nos.1\nand 2 have made construction in survey No.803 and\nblocked public access to the beach. He also\npleaded that even though the land was acquired for\nsports and recreational facilities and use thereof for\nany other purpose is prohibited by the terms of\nagreement, the official respondents are trying to\nregularize illegal structures put up by respondent\nNos.1 and 2 and even violation of CRZ is being\nignored. Another plea taken by Shri Minguel Martins\nwas that respondent Nos.1 and 2 have constructed\nsewerage treatment plant and laundry without\nobtaining permission from the competent authority\nunder the Water (Prevention and Control of\nPollution) Act, 1974 and the Environment Protection\nA\nFOMENTO RESORTS AND HOTELS LTD. AND ANR. v.\nMINGUEL MARTINS AND ORS. [G.S. SINGHVI, J.]\nAct, 1986.\n29\nA\nB\nC\nD\n(xxii) In the reply affidavit filed on behalf of respondent\nNos.1 and 2 in Writ Petition No.330/1991\n(appellants herein), it was pleaded that the\npetitioner is liable to be non-suited on the ground\nof laches and also on the ground that disputed\nquestions of fact are involved. It was further pleaded\nthat the writ petition has been instituted with an\noblique motive at the instance of Dr. Alvaro de\nSouze Macahdo, one of the co-owners of survey\nNo.792 and developer of Machado's Cove, namely,\nM/s. Alcon Real Estate Private Ltd., who filed Civil\nSuit No.67 of 1986 for similar relief but could not\npersuade Civil Judge, Junior Division, Panaji to\nentertain their prayer for temporary injunction. The\nappellants alleged that after having failed to secure\ninjunction from the civil court, Victor Albuquerque,\nthe partner of M/s. Alcon Real Estates Private Ltd.\nfiled Writ Petition No.284/1991 and Minguel Martins\nfiled Writ Petition No.330/1991 and this was\nindicative of the fact that the petitioner was in E\ncollusion with the developer of Machado's Cove.\nThey also questioned, the locus of the petitioner by\nstating that plot bearing survey No.792 has not\nbeen sub-divided and he does not have any interest\nin that property. On merits it was averred that road, F\ncar parking facilities and footpath leading to the\nbeach have been provided in accordance with the\ncondition imposed by the Chief Town Planner and\nGram Panchayat and the same are in existence\nsince 1979 and are being used by the public without G\nany obstruction. The appellants denied existence of\na pathway through survey Nos.792 and 803 and\npleaded that members of the public do not have the\nright to access the beach through survey No.803.\nThe appellants also relied on Section 16 of the H\nA\n00\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\n0\nH\n30\n30\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2009] 3 S.C.R.\n1894 Act and averred that even if there existed\naccess to the beach through the acquired land, the\nsame stood extinguished after vesting of the land\nin the government, possession of which was given\nto appellant No.1 on 26.3.1985. On the issue of\nextension of hotel building, the appellants pleaded\nthat additional construction was made in\naccordance with the permission granted vide order\ndated 15.4.1988 and after obtaining approval of the\nproposed deviation from the competent authority.\nAs regards, the laundry and water treatment plant,\nit was averred that temporary sheds were\nconstructed for laundry after obtaining permission\nfrom the Sarpanch of the Gram Panchayat and that\ntreated effluent are intended to be used for\ngardening, manuring and other purposes for which\nno separate permission was necessary. The\nappellants referred to Suit No.313/1978/A filed by\nGustavo Renato da Cruz Pinto and others for\ndecree of possession by pre-emption and averred\nthat the so called admissions made in the written\nstatement about the existence of public pathway\nthrough plots bearing survey Nos. 792 and 803 is\nnot binding on them because contents of the written\nstatement were not verified by the authorized\nrepresentative of appellant No.2, on the basis of\npersonal knowledge and in their rejoinder, even the\nplaintiffs had not accepted the existence of such\npathway. In support of their plea that there is no\npublic pathway or access to the beach through\nsurvey Nos. 792 and 803, the appellants relied on\nthe judgment of Special Civil Suit No. 67/1986 -\nAlvaro De Souza Machado and another v.\nSociedade De Fomento Industrial Pvt.
