[Para 8] [643-B-C]\nCIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION : Civil Appeal No. 1185 of 2007.\n640\n;\nSTATE OF PUNJAB v. SWARAN KAUR [PASAYAT. J.]\n641\nFrom the Final Judgment and Order dated 27.4.2004 and 13.5.2005 of the A\nHigh Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh in CWP.No. 2899/2003 and\nRA No. 62/2005 in CWP No. 2899/2003.\nH.S. Munjral and Arun K. Sinha for the Appellants.\nR.K. Kapoor, M.K. Verma, Govind Kaushik, S.S. Yadav and Anis Ahmed B\nKhan for the Respondents.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nDR. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. 1. Leave granted.\n2. Challenge in these appeals is to the orders passed by a Division\nBench of the Punjab and Haryana High Court. One of them relates to the\norders passed in the writ petition while other one relates to the order passed\nin a review application.\nC\nE\n3. The basic question raised in the writ petition filed by the respondents D\nwas whether the authorities were justified in holding that they did not possess\nthe requisite qualification for appointment under the Punjab State Class IV\nService Rules, 1963 (in short the 'Rules'). The State of Punjab had taken over\nChanan Devi Memorial Girl High School, Saleem Tabri, Ludhiana under certain\nconditions so far as the employment of the members of staff concerned. The\nDirector Public Instructions, Punjab wrote to the District Education Officer,\nChandigarh to ensure that all the members of the staff fulfil the requisite\nqualification for recruitment to the relevant post. Taking exception to the view\nexpressed by the District Education officer that the writ petitioners who are\nthe respondents in these appeals did not possess requisite qualification. Writ\npetition was filed stating that said view is not sustainable in law. Purportedly F\nacting on a basis of a concession made by learned Additional Advocate\nGeneral, who was appearing in the writ petition, the writ petition was allowed.\nThe learned Additional Advocate General, Punjab purportedly conceded that\nthe rules were not applicable to the case of the writ petitioner. Subsequently\na review petition was filed stating that the concession was uncalled for\nbecause the letter of the Director, Public Instructions, Punjab dated 17.11.1995\naddressed to the District Education officer, Chandigarh clearly stipulated the\nterms for continuance in service. The High Court dismissed the review\napplication on the ground that there was no prescription in the said letter\nwhich would indicate applicability of the rules.\nG\nH\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n642\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 3 S.C.R.\n4. In support of the appeals, learned counsel for the appellants submitted\nthat the view of the High Court is clearly untenable. The Director, Public\nInstructions had clearly stipulated in the said letter that it was the duty of\nthe District Education Officer to ensure that all the members of the staff of\nthe taken over educational institute fulfil the requisite qualification for\nrecruitment to the relevant posts. With reference to the rules it is pointed out\nthat certain educational qualifications have been prescribed which the\nrespondents did not possess.\n5. In response learned counsel for the respondents submitted that more\nthan a decade has since elapsed and it would not be proper to interfere with\nthe order of the High Court which was based initially on concession and\nsubsequently on a finding recorded that there was no prescription in the letter\ndated 17.11.1995 relating to educational qualifications.\n6. At this juncture it is necessary to take note of the relevant provisions\nin the Rules which read as follows:\n\"Rule 5: No person shall be recruited to the Service by direct\nappointment unless he -\n(a) produces certificates of character from two responsible persons,\nnot being his relatives, who are well acquainted with him in\nprivate life;\n(b) is not less than 16 years and not more than 35 years of age on\nthe date of appointment;\n(c) has not more than one wife living and in the case of a woman,\nis not married to a person already having a living wife:\nProvided that the Government may, if satisfied that there are\nspecial grounds for doing so, exempt any person from the\noperation of this clause; and\n(d) possesses the requisite knowledge of the regional languages and\nof English as may be prescribed by the Government from time to\ntime:\nProvided that the appointing authority may, if it is of the opinion\nthat the candidate is otherwise fit to discharge his duties\nsatisfactorily, relax any of the qualification prescribed under this\nclause.\"\nSTATE OF PUNJAB v. SWARAN KAUR [PASAYAT, J.]\n643\n7. Similarly in the letter of Director of Public Instructions it was clearly A\nstated as follows:\n“.....it is the duty of the District Education Officer to see that all of\nthem fulfil the requisite qualification for recruitment in the relevant\nposts.\"\n8. The effect of the afore-stated rule and the indication in the letter has\nnot been considered by the High Court. In the circumstances, we set aside\nthe orders of the High Court and remit the matter to it for fresh consideration.\nWe make it clear that we have not expressed any opinion on the merits. The\nHigh Court is requested to dispose of the writ petition as early as practicable.\nB\nC\n9. The appeals are allowed to the aforesaid extent without any order as\nto costs.\nD.G.\nAppeals allowed.\nŕ\n"}
