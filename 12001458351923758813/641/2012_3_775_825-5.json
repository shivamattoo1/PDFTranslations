{"pages":[{"pageNumber":51}],"text":"RAVI YASHWANT BHOIR v. DISTRICT COLLECTOR, 825\nRAIGAD AND ORS. [DR. B.S. CHAUHAN, J.]\nIn fact, this Court has been deprived of seeing the original A\nrecord and to examine the grievance of the appellant. We\nexpress our grave concern and shock the way the State\nAuthorities has treated the highest court of the land. In such a\nfact-situation, the court has no option except to draw the\nadverse inference against the State.\n50. In view of the above, the appeal succeeds and is\nallowed. The judgment and order of the High Court dated\n18.6.2009 as well as the order passed by the Hon'ble Chief\nMinister dated 21.3.2009 are hereby set aside.\nB\nC\nThis Court while entertaining the petition had granted\ninterim protection to the appellant vide order dated 17.7.2009,\nwhich was extended till further orders vide order dated\n13.8.2009 and, thus, the orders impugned remained\ninoperative. Thus, it will be deemed as no order had ever been D\npassed against the appellant.\nIn the facts and circumstances of the case, there will be\nno order as to costs.\nA copy of the order be sent directly to the Chief Secretary,\nState of Maharashtra, Bombay, who may conduct an enquiry\nand send his personal affidavit as under what circumstances\nthe State Authorities could decide not to ensure compliance of\nthe order of this Court dated 13.2.2012, within a period of four\nweek from the date of receipt of this order, to the Registrar\nGeneral of this Court who may place it alongwith the file before\nthe Bench.\nD.G.\nAppeal allowed.\nE\nF\n"}
