Luwang, (for M/s Corporate Law Group) for the Respondent.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nDR. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. 1. Leave granted.\n2. Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment rendered by a learned\nSingle Judge of the Guwahati High Court dismissing the revision petition filed\nby the appellant.\n3. Background facts in a nutshell are as follows:\n4. The appellant was found guilty of offences punishable under Section\n7 read with Section 16(1) of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954\n(in short the 'Act') by the trial Court. First Appellate Court dismissed the\nappeal. The revision, as noted above, was dismissed by the High Court.\n5. Background facts in a nutshell are as follows:\nOn 20.5.1987 the Food Inspector collected sample of chilli powder from\nthe shop of the appellant. The sample was sent for analysis to the prescribed\nlaboratory and on such analysis it was found to be adulterated. The appellant\nwas tried. On conclusion of the trial, the trial Court convicted the appellant\nfor offences punishable under Section 7 read with Section 16(1) of the Act\nand sentenced him to imprisonment for six months and to pay a fine of\nRs.1,000/-.\nH\nSATYANARAYAN AGARWAL v. STATE OF ASSAM [PASAYAT, J.] 671\n6. An appeal was preferred before the learned Sessions Judge, Dibrugarh, A\n*which was dismissed. As noted above, the revision before the learned Single\nJudge was also dismissed.\n7. Learned counsel for the appellant re-iterated the submissions made\nbefore the courts below and submitted that it is a case of misbranding and,\ntherefore, it is not a case where minimum sentence is to be imposed. The High B\nCourt did not accept the contention. It was of the view that it is not a case\nof misbranding. Additionally, it was submitted that the High Court should\nhave directed release of the appellant on probation, or instead of custodial\nsentence, sentence of fine could have been imposed.\n8. Learned counsel for the respondent-State on the other hand supported\nthe judgment. It is to be noted that the High Court found that there was no\nscope for interference. However, it enhanced the fine to Rs.5,000/- and permitted\nthe appellant to move the State Government under Section 433 of the Code\nof Criminal Procedure, 1973 (in short the 'Code').\n9. In N. Sukumaran Nair v. Food Inspector, Mavelikara, [1997] 9 SCC\n101 this Court observed as follows:\nC\nᎠ\n\"The offence took place in the year 1984. The appellant has been\nawarded six months' simple imprisonment and has also been ordered\nto pay a fine of Rs.1,000/. Under clause (d) of Section 433 of the Code E\nof Criminal Procedure, \"the appropriate government\" is empowered to\ncommute the sentence of simple imprisonment for fine. We think that\nthis would be an appropriate case for commutation of sentence where\nalmost a decade has gone by. We, therefore, direct the appellant to\ndeposit in the trial Court a sum of Rs.6000 as fine in commutation of\nthe sentence of six months' simple imprisonment within a period of six\nweeks from today and intimate to the appropriate Government that\nsuch fine has been deposited. On deposit of such fine, the State\nGovernment may formalize the matter by passing appropriate orders\nunder clause (d) of Section 433 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.\"\n10. In Santosh Kumar v. Municipal Corporation and Anr., [2000] 9 SCC\n151, similar view was expressed in the following terms:\n\"We, therefore, direct the appellant to deposit in the trial court a\nsum of Rs.10,000/- as fine in commutation of the sentence of 6 months'\nimprisonment within a period of 6 weeks from today and intimate to\nF\nG\nH\n672\nA\nB\nC\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 5 S.C.R.\nthe appropriate Government that such fine has been deposited. On\ndeposit of the fine the State Government may formalize the matter by\npassing appropriate order under clause (d) of Section 433 of the Code\nof Criminal Procedure. In the meanwhile the appellant will remain on\nbail.\"\n11. It is to be noted that in both the cases there was no direction to\nformalize the sentence. On the other hand it was clearly noted that the State\nGovernment may formalize the sentence. It is pointed out by learned counsel\nfor the respondent that an application in terms of Section 433 of the Code was\nmade which has been rejected.\n12. We find no merit in this appeal which is accordingly dismissed.\nHowever, the appellant, may, if so advised, challenge the order stated to have\nbeen passed by the State Government under Section 433 of the Code.\nS.K.S.\nAppeal dismissed.\n•\n\"-\n"}
