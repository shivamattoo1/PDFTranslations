Not being satisfied with the explanation,\nappellant informed the respondent that she was deemed to have voluntary\nretired from service from 23.12.1992. Aggrieved respondent filed writ petition\nfor re-instatement in service which was dismissed. Meanwhile Syndicate Bank\n(Employees') Pension Regulations, 1995 came into force. Bank issued a\ncircular dated 4.11.1995 that the Regulations were applicable to those who\nwere in service of Bank on or after 01.01.1986 but had retired before\n29.09.1995. However, the employees who had voluntary retired or deemed to\nhave voluntarily retired between 01.01.1986 and 31.10.1993 were not eligible\nfor pension under the Regulations. The circular also provided that ex-\nG employees who had not exercised their option for pension under the Regulation\ncould exercise their option. Respondent was in service since 07.04.1969 and\nhad retired from 22.12.1992. Respondent applied for pension scheme but was\nrejected. Respondent then filed writ petition. Single Judge of High Court\ndismissed the petition holding that the respondent was not eligible for pension.\nH\n242\nSYNDICATE BANK, BANGALORE v. SATYA SRINATH\n243\nHowever, Division Bench of High Court set aside the order and held that the A\nrespondent was entitled to pension as per the Regulations. Hence the present\nappeal.\nDismissing the appeal, the Court\nC\nHELD: 1.1. The respondent submitted her explanation and sought B\nextension of time on medical ground. But the management of the Bank instead\nof considering the matter sympathetically ordered for premature retirement\nunder the purported exercise of Clause 17(a). It is not the case that she had\nvoluntarily retired but it is a case where the bank has retired her as a\nmeasure of punishment because they were not satisfied with her explanation.\nTherefore, it is not a case which can be covered by the clarification issued by\nthe Bank and it cannot be deemed that she has voluntarily retired. The\ncontingency in the instant case is not covered by the Circular dated 4.11.1995.\nIn Clause 17 (a) a person who deliberately does not join the office and leaves\nthe office without any satisfactory explanation, then it is open for the\nmanagement to resort to Clause 17(a). But in the instant case, the facts are D\nvery glarin that incumbent has put in 20 years of service and unfortunately\nshe fell sick and sought for extension of leave on medical ground, that was\ndenied to her. Therefore, it is not the case of the abandoned service or she did\nnot send any reply to the notice sent by the management. However, she has\nmad a humble reply to satisfy her authorities, that taking leave was beyond\nher control, i.e., ill health. But the authorities retired her prematurely and\ndenied the pension of 20 years of service. Therefore, this kind of action is\nunfair arbitrary which cannot be accepted. In fact the order passed by the\nbank clearly states it is not the case of premature reitrement and it is not the\ncase that she has sought voluntary retirement or premature retirement. It is\nthe bank who has retired her and that kind of contingency is not covered in\nthe clarification made by the bank. It is case of deemed voluntary retirement\nforced on her. The said contingency is not covered under the aforesaid order\nof authorities. It was a forced retirement by the respondent-bank.\n[Para 9] [248-G-H; 249-A-D]\nE\nF\n1.2. The observation by the Bank that the letter rejecting her G\nrepresentation for pension was because of her deemed retirement brought\nabout by her, on account of her own action is not correct. The decision of\nmanagement, \"deemed to have been voluntarily retired\" to totally misconceived.\n[Para 10] [249-E-F]\nPunjab \u0026 Sind Bank and Ors. v. Sakattar Singh, [2001] 1 SCC 214, H\n_\n244\nA referred to.\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 5 S.C.R.\n1.3. The expression 'resignation' and 'voluntary retirement' are\ndeliberate abandonment of service. Each expression carries different\nconnotation and each case has to be examined whether it was a case of\nvoluntary retirement sought by the employee or he has been retired on account\nB of superannuation or he has resigned or he has been retired compulsorily as\na measure of punishment. In case, the compulsory retirement/the premature\nretirement has been imposed by the appellant, it is not voluntarily sought by\nthe respondent. It is a clear case of compulsory retirement ordered by the\nManagement and that contingency has not been contemplated in the circular\nissued on 4.11.1995. Therefore, in any case, she could not be denied the benefit\nof her 20 years' of service when she comes within the pension scheme that\nshe was employed prior to 1986 and retired before 29.9.95. Therefore, she is\nentitled to pension. [Para 12] [250-C-E]\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nUCO Bank and Ors. v.

Dial, Sumati Anand and Rajiv Nanda for the Appellant.\nAnitha Shenoy and Naveen R. Nath for the Respondent.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nA.K. MATHUR, J. 1. This appeal is directed against the order dated 7th\nApril, 2003 passed by the Division of the Karnataka High Court whereby the\nDivision Bench has set aside the order of the learned Single Judge and\nallowed the writ petition No. 25322 of 1999, quashed the impugned order\ndated 26th June, 1999 and directed the management of the appellant-Bank to\npay the pension to the respondent from 1.11.1993.\n2. The respondent was the employee of the Syndicate Bank. The\nrespondent remained unauthorisedly absent w.e.f. 11.3.1992 and a notice\ndated 18.11.1992 was issued to her calling upon her either to report back for\nduty or submit explanation for her absence within 30 days i.e. on or before\n21.12.1992. It was also stipulated that if she failed to comply with the directions\nH she would be deemed to have voluntarily retired from the service of the bank\nK\n1\nSYNDICATE BANK, BANGALORE v. SATYA SRINATH [A.K. MATHUR, J.] 245\non expiry of 30 days from the date of notice in terms of Clause 17(a) of the A\nVth Bipartite Settlement. The respondent (herein) sent her explanation but the\nBank Management did not find the explanation satisfactory. Therefore, the\nappellant vide letter dated 10.12.1992 informed the respondent (herein) that\nshe was deemed to have voluntarily retired from service w.e.f. 23.12.1992 in\nterms of Clause 17(a) of the Vth Bipartite Settlement and she was deemed to\nB\nhave ceased from the service of the bank from that date. The explanation sent\nby the respondent (herein) was that due to illness she was unable to report\nfor duty immediately and sought extension of time to report for duty and\nsubmitted an application for extension of leave supported by a medical\ncertificate. Aggrieved against the order passed by the appellant, the respondent\nfiled the writ petition No. 1259/1995 in the High Court seeking a direction to C\nthe appellant bank to reinstate her into service with all benefits. Learned\nSingle Judge vide order dated 23.1.1995 dismissed the writ petition on the\nground that there was inordinate delay in assailing the validity of the order\ndated 30.12.1992. Meanwhile the Syndicate Bank (Employees') Pension\nRegulations, 1995 (hereinafter to be referred to as the Regulation) came into\nD\nforce on 29.9.1995 i.e. the date of publication of the Regulations in the Official\nGazette. The appellant issued a circular dated 4.11.1995 stating the Regulations\nwere applicable to the following categories of employees:\n(i) Those who were in the service of the Bank on or after 1.1.1986 but\nhad retired before 29.9.1995.\nE\n(ii) Those who were in the service of the Bank before 29.9.1995 and\ncontinued to be in the service of the Bank on or after 29.9.1995.\n(iii) Those who joined the services of the Bank on or after 29.9.1995.\n(iv) to (viii) omitted as are not relevant.\nF\n***\n***\n***\n3. It was clarified that the ex-employees who had voluntarily retired in\nterms of Bank's Service Regulations Clause No. 19(1) or deemed to have\nvoluntarily retired in terms of Vth Bipartite Settlement, between 1.1.1986 and\n31.10.1993 are not eligible for pension under the pension Regulations, 1995.\n4. It was also mentioned that regulation 29 of Pension Regulations 1995\nprovided for voluntary retirement of the employees who had completed 20\nyears of qualifying service by giving notice of not less than 3 months, in\nwriting, subject to the conditions laid down therein.\nG\nH\nA\n246\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 5 S.C.R.\n5. The said circular also provided that ex-employees who had not\nexercised their option for pension under the Regulations earlier could exercise\ntheir option under the scheme within 120 days from 29.9.1995. In pursuance\nof that circular the respondent applied for pension scheme on 28.12.1995 but\nthe same was rejected by the management on 22.1.1996. Aggrieved against\nthe order, the respondent (herein) filed a writ petition No. 1370 of 1987 before\nthe High Court. Learned Single Judge allowed the writ petition by order dated\n17.2.1989 and held that since the respondent retired from service after 1.1.86\nshe was eligible for pensionary benefits under the Regulations and the High\nCourt remanded the matter to the Bank for fresh consideration of the claim\nof the respondent(herein). After the remand the appellant bank reconsidered\nC the matter and rejected the same by communication dated 26.6.1999. The\nreasons given by the appellant-bank for the rejection read as under:\nB\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nâ€œYou remained absent from duties continuously from 11.3.1992.\nEven after service of notice since you did not join the duties nor\nsubmit any explanation for your absence, you were deemed to have\nvoluntarily vacated/retired from the Bank's service with effect from\n22.12.1992 in terms of Clause 17 of the Vth Bipartite Settlement.\nPlease note that such deemed retirement was not brought about\nby any positive action on the part of the Bank but is wholly on\naccount of your own action. Your cessation in service became final\nas the writ petition filed by you challenging the Bank's order dated\n30.12.1992 was dismissed by the Hon'ble High Court by its order\ndated 25.1.1995. It is, therefore, observed that you did not cease to\nbe in the bank's service on reaching the age of superannuation nor\ndid you seek and obtain voluntary retirement as per Regulation No.\n29 of the Syndicate Bank (Employees) Pension Regulations, 1995. It\nis also not a case of premature retirement as described in the Pension\nRegulations because there is no positive action on the part of the\nBank. Your action in effect amounted to abandonment of service. It\nis thus seen that you do not come within the scope of the Pension\nRegulations entitling you to receive pension. Further the Bank's circular\nNo. 226/95/BC/PD/61/SWD dated 4.11.1995, it has been clarified that\nthe ex-employees who have voluntary retired in terms of the Bipartite\nSettlement, between 1.1.1986 and 31.10.1993 are not eligible for pension\nunder the Pension Regulations, 1995. You cease to be in the services\nof the Bank w.e.f. 22.12.1992 and hence you are not entitled to pension.\nEven assuming without conceding that you had retired voluntarily\nJ\nSYNDICATE BANK, BANGALORE v. SATYA SRINATH [A.K. MATHUR, J.] 247\nfrom the services of the Bank as per the Pension Regulations, 1995, A\nyou would not be entitled to pension under the Pension Regulations,\nas you retired before 1.11.1993.\"\n6. Aggrieved against that order the respondent filed another writ petition\nbefore the High Court. This came to be registered vide writ petition No. 25322\nof 1999. Learned Single Judge held that the respondent was not entitled to B\npension under the relevant regulations and dismissed the writ petition vide\norder dated 27.7.1999. Aggrieved against that order also, the matter was taken\nup by the respondent (herein) in appeal before the Division Bench and the\nDivision Bench after considering the matter came to the conclusion that the\nrespondent was entitled to pension as per Regulations. Hence, the present C\nappeal.\n7. It is a fact that the respondent(herein) was in the service of the Bank\nsince 7th April, 1969 and she had retired from the bank service w.e.f. 22.12.1992\nand as per the regulation, the employees of the Bank who opted for pension\nwere in the service of the Bank on or after 1.1.1986 but was retired before D\n29.9.95. Therefore, this condition stands fulfilled. These two parameters are\nnot in dispute. The only question that calls for determination is that as per\nthe Regulation and the circular dated 4.11.1995 issued by the Bank whether\nthe respondent is entitled to pension or not? As per the clarification issued\nby the bank that ex-employees who had voluntarily retired from the bank's\nservice or deemed to have voluntarily retired between 1.1.1986 and 31.10.1993,\nwould not be eligible for pension under the Pension Regulation.\nE\nF\n8. Now, the question is whether the respondent was deemed to have\nvoluntarily retired as per Vth Bipartite Settlement or she has been retired by\nthe appellant-bank. There can be two class of persons; one who sought\nvoluntary retirement or the other who was deemed to have voluntarily retired.\nIt is not the case of the voluntary retirement but she was made to retire by\nthe order of the management. Therefore, she does not fall in either of the two\ncategories. The respondent(herein) remained absent because of her ill-health\nand she submitted her application for extension of leave on medical ground\nbut the management instead of taking sympathetic view, retired the respondent G\nfrom the services of the bank. As she does not fall either of the above two\ncategories, this is the third category which is not contemplated in the\nregulations. However, an attempt was made to bring her case in terms of the\nClause 17(a) which says that if an employee absents himself from work for\na period of 90 days or more consecutive days, without submitting leave\nH\n248\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 5 S.C.R.\nA application on his credit or beyond a period of leave sanctioned originally/\nsubsequently and if the management is reasonably satisfied that the incumbent\nhas no intention of joining duties, the management may at any time thereafter\ngive notice to the employee and call him/her to report for duty and require\nthe employee to furnish explanation within 30 days of the date of notice. If\nthe employee does not satisfy the management, he/she can be deemed to\nhave retired on expiry of the notice. In the event, the employee satisfies the\nbank, he/she can report for duty thereafter within 30 days of the expiry of\nthe notice without prejudice to the bank's rights to take action under the\nservice rules. In this regard Clause 17(a) of the Vth Bipartite Settlement reads\nas under:\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\n\"(a) when an employee absents himself from work for a period of 90\ndays or more consecutive days, without submitting an application for\nleave on his credit or beyond period of leave sanctioned originally/\nsubsequently or when there is satisfactory evidence that he has taken\nemployment in India or when management is reasonably satisfied that\nhe has no intention of joining duties, the management may at anytime\nthereafter give a notice to the employee at his last known address\ncalling upon him to report for duty within 30 days of the date of\nnotice, stating inter alia the grounds for coming to the conclusion that\nthe employee had no intention of joining duties and furnishing\nnecessary evidence, where available. Unless the employee reports for\nduty within 30 days of the notice or gives an explanation for absence\nwithin the said period of 30 days satisfying the management that he\nhas not taken up another employment or a vocation and that he has\nno intention of not joining duties, the employee will be deemed to\nhave voluntarily retired from Bank's service on the expiry of the said\nnotice. In the event of the employee submitting a satisfactory reply,\nhe shall be permitted to report for duty thereafter within 30 days of\nthe date of expiry of the aforesaid notice without prejudice to the\nbank's right to take action under the law or rules of service.\"\n9. In the present case, the respondent(herein) submitted her explanation\nG and sought extension of time on medical ground. But the management of the\nBank instead of considering the matter sympathetically, ordered for premature\nretirement under the purported exercise of Clause 17(a). It is not the case that\nshe had voluntarily retired but it is a case where the bank has retired her as\na measure of punishment because they were not satisfied by her explanation.\nTherefore, it is not a case which can be covered by the clarification issued\nH\nSYNDICATE BANK, BANGALORE v. SATYA SRINATH [A.K. MATHUR, J.]\n249\n7\nB\nby the Bank and it cannot be deemed that she has voluntarily retired. The A\ncontingency in the present case is not covered by the aforesaid Circular dated\n4.11.1995. In the present case the respondent has put in almost 20 years' of\nservice and has taken leave on medical ground which is being denied to her.\nIn Clause 17 (a) what is contemplated is that a person who deliberately does\nnot join the office and leaves the office without any satisfactory explanation,\nthen it is open for the management to resort to Clause 17(a). But in the present\ncase, the facts are very glaring that incumbent has put in 20 years of service\nand unfortunately she fell sick and sought for extension of leave on medica!\nground, that was denied to her. Therefore, it is not the case of the abandoned\nservice or she did not send any reply to the notice sent by the management.\nHowever, she has made a humble reply to satisfy her authorities, that taking C\nleave was beyond her control, i.e. ill health. But the authorities retired her\nprematurally and denied the pension of 20 years of service. Therefore, this\nkind of action is unfair, arbitrary which cannot be countenanced. In fact the\norder passed by the bank clearly states it is not the case of premature\nretirement and it is not the case that she has sought voluntary retirement or\npremature retirement. It is the bank who has retired her and that kind of\ncontingency is not covered in the clarification made by the bank. It is a case\nof deemed voluntary retirement forced on her. The said contingency is not\ncovered under the aforesaid order of authorities. It was a forced retirement\nby the respondent-bank.\nD\nE\n10. Learned counsel has tried to persuade us that the letter rejecting her\nrepresentation for pension was because of her deemed retirement brought\nabout by her, on account of her own action. This observation of the bank is\nnot correct. In fact the retirement has been forced by the bank. It is not the\ncase that she was not willing to join the service but was unable to join due\nto ill-health. The decision of management, \"deemed to have been voluntarily F\nretired\" is totally misconceived.\n11. Learned counsel has tried to place a strong reliance on the case of\nPunjab \u0026 Sind Bank and Ors. v. Sakattar Singh, reported in [2001] 1 SCC\n214 wherein no domestic inquiry was held and three letters were issued to the\nincumbent directing him to join the duty and seeking explanation for G\nunauthorized absence. The respondent submitted the joining report that he\nwas suffering from eye ailment that was not accepted by the authorities and\nthe services were terminated. The High Court set aside the termination and\nthe matter came up before this Court and this Court in the facts and\ncircumstances of the case held that the rules of natural justice should be H\n250\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2007] 5 S.C.R.\nA borne in mind in the relevant fact situation. But in the present case, as already\nmentioned above, the fact that she had submitted her explanation supported\nby a medical certificate was not accepted by the bank- management and she\nwas forced to retire. This contingency is not covered under circular dated\n4.11.1995.\nB\nC\n12. Our attention was also invited to the case of UCO Bank and Ors.\nv. Sanwar Mal, reported in [2004] 4 SCC 412 wherein their Lordships made\na distinction between \"resignation and retirement\", that it carries a different\nmeaning and it was observed that an employee can resign any time but he\nretires only on superannuation or in case of voluntary retirement on completion\nof qualifying service. The expression 'resignation' and 'voluntary retirement'\nare deliberate abandonment of service. Each expression carries different\nconnotation and each case has to be examined whether it was a case of\nvoluntary retirement sought by the employee or he has been retired on\naccount of superannuation or he has resigned or he has been retired\ncompulsorily as a measure of punishment. But so far as the present controversy\nD is concerned, the compulsory retirement/ the premature retirement has been\nimposed by the appellant, it is not voluntarily sought by the respondent. It\nis a clear case of compulsory retirement ordered by the Management and that\ncontingency has not been contemplated in the circular issued on 4.11.1995.\nTherefore, in any case, we are of the opinion that she could not be denied\nthe benefit of her 20 years' of service when she comes within the pension\nscheme that she was employed prior to 1986 and retired before 29.9.95.\nTherefore, she is entitled to pension. In this view of the matter, we are of the\nopinion that the view taken by the Division Bench of High Court is correct\nand there is no merit in this appeal filed by the Bank. Hence, the same is\ndismissed with no order as to costs.\nE\n\"\nF\nN.J.\nAppeal is dismissed.\n;\n\u003e\n*\n"}
