It is also baffling\nto note that the conversion certificate from the Arya Samaj was\nnot examined in detail by the respondents inspite of the High\nCourt making a strong observation in this regard. No proof by\nB way of documents or oral evidence was provided to show how\nthe certificate was granted and what procedure was followed.\nIt is also pertinent to mention that no one raised any objection\nto the appellant filing her nomination for the Assembly elections\nin 2006 from the reserved constituency. All the issues have\nbeen raised after the appellant won the election from the\nRajapalayam constituency. As pointed by the High Court, it is\nnot necessary to read too much into contributions made into\nreligious bodies and institutions as it is open for people outside\nthe particular community also. Hence based purely on the\nevidence before this court and the observations made by us in\nthis regard, the Election petitioner has not been able to prove\nconclusively that the appellant professes Christianity. The\nevidence produced is, contradictory and smacks of political\nrivalry.\nC\nD\nE\n59. In light of these findings, we need not go into the other\nissues.\n60. In the result we allow this appeal and set aside the\nimpugned order passed by the High Court. No order as to costs.\nD.G.\nAppeal allowed.\n"}
