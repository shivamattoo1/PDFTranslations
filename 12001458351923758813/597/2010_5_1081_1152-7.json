This issue need not detain us for A\nlong in view of our answer to the issue of \"Doctrine of Merger\"\ncanvassed by learned senior counsel.\nB\nC\n75. Arguments have been advanced before us based on\nthe principles of res judicata, Doctrine of Estoppel and the\nprinciples underlining the provisions of Order II Rule 2 of the\nCode of Civil Procedure that the High Court in earlier batch of\nwrit petitions has gone into and given findings with regard to\nthe Notifications dated 30.9.1991; 31.3.1995; 15.5.1996;\n1.8.1996 and 24.7.1998 and the judgment of the High Court\ndated 21.1.1999 rendered therein had merged with the order\nof the Supreme Court dated 13.2.2001 and the Notifications\nquestioned in the present round of litigation are Notifications\ndated 15.5.1996 and 1.8.1996 and the State at no point of time\nbefore any Court having raised the issue of these two\nNotifications being void ab initio for want of compliance with D\nthe provisions of the Business Rules framed under Article\n166(3) of the Constitution of India, the High Court ought to have\nrejected the plea of the State Government that the Notifications\nwere illegal or were in violation of the Rules of Business and\ndismissed the Writ Petition on the principles of res judicata, E\nDoctrine of Estoppel and the principles embodied in Order II\nRule 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure. It was urged that the\nState not having raised this at any point of time before any court\nshould not be allowed to do so. We do not find any merit in\nthese contentions. As noticed by us earlier in the judgment, the\nissue regarding the validity or legality of the Notifications dated\n15.5.1996 and 1.8.1996 was never raised in the earlier batch\nof writ petitions before the High Court and the High Court never\nhad an opportunity or occasion to look into, consider and\npronounce upon the validity of the same with reference to the\nBusiness Rules framed under Article 166 (3) of the Constitution.\nThese principles pressed into service by the appellants cannot\noperate against the State Government merely because the\nState did not agitate either before the High Court or this Court\nthe legality or validity of these notification in the earlier round\nF\nG\nH\nB\nC\n1152 SUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2010] 5 S.C.R.\nA of litigation when it had an occasion to do so and the State\nGovernment cannot be deemed to have accepted the legality\nof the Notification and waived its objection or challenge thereto.\nThe Doctrine of Estoppel therefore has no application at all\nmore so, in view of the illegality the notifications dated\n15.05.1996 and 01.08.1996 suffer from in view of their non-\ncompliance with the provisions of the Business Rules. In our\nopinion the fact that the State Government did not raise these\nobjections in the earlier batch of Writ Ptitions does not disentitle\nit to such a stand or prevents it from raising its objections based\non legal provisions. This contention of the appellants requires\nto be turned down for yet another reason in that the 1st\nrespondent herein was not a party to the earlier batch of Writ\nPetitions before the High Court or this Court. Therefore the\nprinciples of res judicata or for that matter even the Doctrine\nof Estoppel will not apply to or operate against him. Further the\ncontention that the Notification dated 1.8.1996 did not create\nany additional financial liability on the State Government\nwarranting approval by the Cabinet or the compliance of the\nBusiness Rules before it was brought into effect deserves to\nbe rejected having regard to the figures placed on record which\nthe High Court has noticed in its judgment. These figures of\nadditional liability likely to be brought on the State by\nNotification dated 1.8.1996 falsify the statement of the\nappellants. Therefore the same deserves to be rejected.\nD\nE\nF\nG\n76. Before parting with these appeals, we make it clear\nthat the observations made by us in the course of our judgment\nis only for the purpose of disposing of these appeals and shall\nnot be treated as an expression on the conduct of the then the\nPower Minister.\n77. The Appellants have not been able to show any\ninfirmity or illegality in the order of the High Court warranting\nour interference. In the result, civil appeals are dismissed.\nParties are directed to bear their own costs.\nH R.P.\nAppeals dismissed.\n"}
