Sub-section (2) of Section 37 provides for\npayment of price of agricultural produce brought in the\nmarket yard on the same day to the seller at the market\nyard and additional payment at the rate of one percent, per\nday of the total price of the agricultural produce payable\nto the seller within five days. These provisions of Sections\n36 and 37 of the Market Act are in direct conflict with the\nprovisions of Clauses (3), (4), (5), (5A) and (6) of the\nControl Order made by the Central Government under\nSection 3 of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955\ndiscussed above. Similarly these provisions of the Market\nAct are in direct conflict with the provisions of Sections 12,\n15, 16, 19, 20, 21 and 22 of the Sugarcane Act made by\nthe State Legislature of Madhya Pradesh, discussed\nabove. In view of such conflict, either, the aforesaid\nprovisions of the Market Act apply to the transactions of\nbuying and selling of sugarcane between the occupiers of\nfactories and the sugarcane growers or sugarcane\ngrowers cooperative societies, or the provisions of the\nControl Order made by the Central Government and the\naforesaid provisions of the Sugarcane Act made by the\nState Government apply to such transactions of buying and\nselling between the occupiers or owners of sugar factories\nand the sugarcane growers or sugarcane growers\ncooperative societies. The Control Order made by the\nCentral Government and the Sugarcane Act made by the\nState Legislature being a Special Order and Special Act\nrelating to supply and purchase of sugarcane will apply to\ntransactions of sale and purchase of sugarcane between\nthe occupiers of the factory and the sugarcane growers or\nsugarcane growers cooperative societies and the\nprovisions of the Market Act being a General Act with\nregard to agricultural produce will stand excluded and will\nnot apply to such transactions of buying and selling of\nsugarcane between the occupiers of factories and the\nsugarcane growers or sugarcane growers cooperative\nsocieties.\"\nKRISHI UPAJ MANDI SAMITI, NARSINGHPUR v. SHIV 427\nSHAKTI KHANSARI UDYOG [G.S. SINGHVI, J.]\nC\nD\n7. Shri Vivek Tankha, learned senior counsel appearing for A\nthe Market Committees and Shri B.S. Banthia, learned counsel\nappearing for the State argued that the object of the Sugarcane\nAct and the Control Order is to regulate the supply and purchase\nof sugarcane and to ensure that price determined by the\ncompetent authority is paid to the Cane Growers without delay, B\nbut these enactments have nothing to do with the levy of market\nfee on transactions involving the purchase of sugarcane by the\nfactories within the market areas and the High Court committed\nserious error by declaring that the provisions of the Sugarcane\nAct and the Control Order would prevail vis-Ã -vis those\ncontained in the Market Act. The learned counsel further argued\nthat the ratio of the judgment in Belsund Sugar Co. Ltd. v. State\nof Bihar (1999) 9 SCC 620, on which reliance has been placed\nby the High Court, has no bearing on the interpretation of the\nprovisions of the Sugarcane Act and the Market Act because\nthere is significant difference between the Bihar Acts and the\nMadhya Pradesh Acts. Shri Tankha emphasized that the Market\nAct and the Sugarcane Act operate in different fields and even\nif there appears some conflict between the two enactments, the\nprovisions contained in the Market Act would prevail because\nthe Sugarcane Act does not provide for levy of market fee on\nthe purchase of sugarcane by the factories. Learned senior\ncounsel relied upon the judgment in Krishi Upaj Mandi Samiti\nv. Orient Paper and Industries Ltd. (1995) 1 SCC 655 and\nargued that the sugarcane factories are liable to pay market\nfee on the purchase of sugarcane which takes place within the\nmarket areas because they are benefitted by the development\nworks undertaken by the Market Committees and the Madhya\nPradesh Agricultural Marketing Board. Shri Tankha also relied\nupon Article 254 of the Constitution and argued that even\nthough the Control Order has been framed under a Central G\nlegislation, the provisions contained therein cannot override the\nMarket Act which was enforced after receiving Presidential\nassent. In support of this argument, Shri Tankha relied upon the\njudgments in Basantlal Banarsilal v. Bansilal Dagdulal AIR\n1955 Bom. 35, Tika Ramji v. State of U.P. AIR 1956 SC 676 H\nE\nF\n428 SUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2012] 10 S.C.R.\nA = 1956 SCR 393, Kailash Nath v. State of U.P. AIR 1957 SC\n790, Basantlal Banarsilal v.

Srinivasa Resorts Limited\nand others (2009) 5 SCC 342.\nC\nD\n8. Shri Jayant Bhushan and Shri A.K. Sanghi, Senior\nE Advocates and Ms. Pragati Neekhra, learned counsel\nappearing for the respondents supported the impugned orders\nand argued that being a special legislation, which covers all\naspects of the supply and purchase of sugarcane including the\npayment of price to Cane Growers, the Sugarcane Act will\nF prevail over the Market Act, which generally empowers the\nmarket committees to levy market fee on the sale and purchase\nof notified agricultural produce. More so, because the\nprocedure prescribed under Section 36 of the Market Act for\nthe purchase of agricultural produce within the market yard or\nG market proper is in direct conflict with the provisions of the\nSugarcane Act which postulate the purchase of sugarcane by\nthe factories at an identified place or at the factory gate.\nLearned senior counsel then argued that the sugar factories\ncannot be burdened with the liability of paying market fee on\nthe purchase of sugarcane because the same is not taken into\nH\nKRISHI UPAJ MANDI SAMITI, NARSINGHPUR v. SHIV429\nSHAKTI KHANSARI UDYOG [G.S. SINGHVI, J.]\nconsideration while fixing the price of sugar under Clause 3 of A\nthe Control Order. Shri Bhushan submitted that the Court should\nnot entertain the argument made by Shri Tankha with reference\nto Article 254 of the Constitution because no such argument\nwas raised before the High Court and no document has been\nproduced before this Court to show that Presidential assent B\nwas obtained for amendment in the Market Act with specific\nreference to the Sugarcane Act.\n9. For deciding whether there is any conflict between the\nSugarcane Act and the Control Order on the one hand and the\nMarket Act on the other, it will be useful to notice the relevant\nstatutory provisions:\nThe Sugarcane Act\n10. The Sugarcane Act was enacted by the State\nlegislature in the backdrop of inadequate supply of sugarcane\nto the factories and the difficulties faced by the cultivators in\nselling their produce and getting the price. Section 2 of the Act\ncontains definitions of various terms. Section 3 mandates the\nState Government to establish Sugarcane Board for the State.\nIn terms of Section 4, the Sugarcane Board is required to\nadvise the State Government on matters pertaining to the\nregulation of supply and purchase of cane for sugar factories;\nthe varieties of cane which are suitable for use in sugar\nfactories; the maintenance of healthy relations between\noccupiers, managers of factories, Cane-growers' Co-operative\nSocieties, Cane Development Council and purchasing agents\nand such other matters as may be prescribed. Section 5\nprovides for establishment of a Cane Development Council,\nwhose functions are to consider and approve the programme\nfor development of the zone; to advise regarding the ways and\nmeans for the execution of the development plan in all its\nessentials such as cane varieties, cane-seed, sowing\nprogramme, fertilizers and manures; to undertake the\ndevelopment of irrigation and other agricultural facilities in the\nzone; etc. Section 8 lays down that there shall be a fund at the\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nD\n430 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2012] 10 S.C.R.\nA disposal of the Council to meet the expenses required to be\nincurred for the discharge of duties and performance of its\nfunctions under the Act. The fund shall consist of the grants\nmade by the Indian Central Sugarcane Committee and the\nState Government, sums received by the Council by way of\nB commission under Section 21 and any other sum which may\nbe credited to the fund under the general or special order of\nthe State Government. Section 12 empowers the Cane\nCommissioner to call upon the occupier to furnish an estimate\nof the quantity of cane which will be required by the factory\nC during the crushing season. The Cane Commissioner is\nobliged to examine every such estimate and publish the same\nwith modification, if any. Section 13 casts a duty on the occupier\nto maintain a register of all such Cane Growers and Cane-\nGrowers' Co-operative Societies which are required to sell\ncane to the factory. Section 14 empowers the State\nGovernment to make provision for survey of an area proposed\nto be reserved or assigned for supply of cane to a factory.\nSection 15 postulates declaration of reserved area and Section\n16 provides for declaration of an assigned area. Under Section\n19, the State Government has the power to issue an order for\nregulating the distribution, sale or purchase of cane in any\nreserved or assigned area and purchase of cane in any area\nother than the reserved or assigned area. Section 20 deals with\nthe payment of price. Section 21 provides for payment, by the\noccupier, of a commission for every one maund of cane\npurchased by the factory. Section 22 gives power to the State\nGovernment to declare varieties of cane which are unsuitable\nfor use in the factories. Chapter IV contains miscellaneous\nprovisions including Section 30 under which the State\nGovernment is empowered to make rules for giving effect to\nG the provisions of the Act. For the sake of reference, Sections\n5, 6, 8, 15, 16, 19, 20 and 21 of the Sugarcane Act are\nreproduced below:\nE\nF\nH\n\"5.
